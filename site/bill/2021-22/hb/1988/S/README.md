2. If the eligible investment project is not operationally complete within five calendar years from the issuance of the tax deferral certificate, or if, on the basis of the tax performance report under RCW 82.32.534 or other information, the department finds that an eligible investment project is used for purposes other than those listed in section 1(2) of this act at any time during the calendar year in which the investment is certified by the department as having been operationally completed, or at any time during any of the repayment period, a portion of deferred taxes is immediately due according to the following schedule:
