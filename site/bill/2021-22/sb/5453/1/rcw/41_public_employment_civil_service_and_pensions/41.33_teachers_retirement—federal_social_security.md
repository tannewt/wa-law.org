2. As used in this plan the terms quoted below shall have the meanings assigned thereto in this section.

"Political subdivision" means any political subdivision, or instrumentality of one or more subdivisions, or proprietary enterprise acquired, purchased or originated by one or more such subdivisions after December, 1950, which employs members of the teachers' retirement system. The state, its agencies, instrumentalities, and institutions of higher learning shall be grouped and considered as a single political subdivision.

"State" where not otherwise clearly indicated by the context, means the commissioner of employment security or other officer designated by the governor to administer the plan at the state level for all participating political subdivisions.

3. The terms and conditions of this plan are intended and shall be construed to be in conformity with the requirements of the federal social security act as amended and with the requirements of chapter 41.48 RCW, and particularly RCW 41.48.050, as amended by chapter 4, Laws of 1955 extraordinary session.

4. The rights and benefits accruing to employees from membership in the teachers' retirement system shall in no way be altered or impaired by this plan or by the additional and supplementary OASI coverage which such employees may receive hereunder, other than the elimination of (1), (2) and (3) of section 52, chapter 80, Laws of 1947 and RCW 41.32.520 (as recodified by this act) as each are amended, with the exception of that part of (1) which permits a widow or widower without a child or children under age eighteen to receive a monthly payment of fifty dollars at age fifty, provided that the member had fifteen or more years of Washington membership service credit at date of death.

5. There shall be no additional cost to or involvement of the state or a political subdivision with respect to OASI coverage of members of the teachers' retirement system until this plan has been approved by the legislature.

Each employee to whom OASI coverage is made applicable under this plan pursuant to an extension or modification under RCW 41.48.030 of the existing agreement between the secretary of health, education, and welfare and the governor shall be required to pay into the OASI contribution account established by RCW 41.48.060 during the period of such coverage contributions with respect to his or her wages in an amount equal to the employee tax imposed by the federal insurance contributions act (section 3101, Internal Revenue Code of 1954), in consideration of the employee's retention in service by the political subdivision. The subdivision shall withhold such contributions from the wages paid to the employee; and shall remit the contributions so withheld in each calendar quarter to the state for deposit in the contribution account not later than the twentieth calendar day of the month following that quarter.

If any political subdivision other than that comprising the state, its agencies, instrumentalities, and institutions of higher learning fails to remit as provided herein employer contributions or employee contributions, or any part of either, such delinquent contributions may be recovered with interest at the rate of six percent per annum by action in a court of competent jurisdiction against the political subdivision; or such delinquent contributions may at the request of the governor be deducted from any moneys payable to such subdivision by the state.

9. Each political subdivision shall be charged with a share of the cost of administration of this plan by the state, to be computed as that proportion of the overall cost of administration which its total annual contributions bear to the total annual contributions paid by all subdivisions on behalf of employees covered by the plan.

The subdivision shall within ninety days thereafter remit its share of the cost to the state for deposit in the general fund of the state.

10. Each political subdivision shall submit to the state, through the employment security department, P.O.

12.
