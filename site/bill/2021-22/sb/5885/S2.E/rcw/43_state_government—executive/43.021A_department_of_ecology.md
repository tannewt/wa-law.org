## 43.21A.405 - Marine pollution—Baseline study program—Legislative finding and declaration.
The legislature recognizes that there exists a great risk of potential damage from oil pollution of the waters of the state of Washington and further declares that immediate steps must be undertaken to reduce this risk. The legislature also is aware that such danger is expected to increase in future years in proportion to the increase in the size and cargo capacity of ships, barges, and other waterborne carriers, the construction and operational characteristics of these carriers, the density of waterborne traffic, and the need for a greater supply of petroleum products.

A program of systematic baseline studies to be conducted by the department of ecology has been recognized as a vital part of the efforts to reduce the risk of oil pollution of marine waters, and the legislature recognizes that many factors combine to make this effort one of considerable magnitude and difficulty. The marine shoreline of the state is about two thousand seven hundred miles long, a greater length than the combined coastlines of Oregon and California. There are some three million acres of submerged land and more than three hundred islands in these marine waters. The average depth of Puget Sound is two hundred twenty feet. There is a great diversity of animal life in the waters of the state. These waters have a multitude of uses by both humans and nonhumans, and the interaction between human activities and natural processes in these waters varies greatly with locale.

2. The cost-reimbursement agreement shall identify the tasks and costs for work to be conducted under the agreement. The agreement must include a schedule that states:

   a. The estimated number of weeks for initial review of the permit application;

   b. The estimated number of revision cycles;

   c. The estimated number of weeks for review of subsequent revision submittals;

   d. The estimated number of billable hours of employee time;

   e. The rate per hour; and

   f. A date for revision of the agreement if necessary.

3. The written cost-reimbursement agreement shall be negotiated with the permit applicant or project proponent.

The department may also use funds provided under a cost-reimbursement agreement to hire temporary employees, to assign current staff to review the work of the consultant, to provide necessary technical assistance when an independent consultant with comparable technical skills is unavailable, and to recover reasonable and necessary direct and indirect costs that arise from processing the permit. The department shall, in developing the agreement, ensure that final decisions that involve policy matters are made by the agency and not by the consultant. The department shall make an estimate of the number of permanent staff hours to process the permits, and shall contract with consultants or hire temporary employees to replace the time and functions committed by these permanent staff to the project. The billing process shall provide for accurate time and cost accounting and may include a billing cycle that provides for progress payments. 

4. The cost-reimbursement agreement must not negatively impact the processing of other permit applications. In order to maintain permit processing capacity, the agency may hire outside consultants, temporary employees, or make internal administrative changes.
