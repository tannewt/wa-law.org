## 79A.05.600 - Declaration of principles.
The beaches bounding the Pacific Ocean from the Straits of Juan de Fuca to Cape Disappointment at the mouth of the Columbia River constitute some of the last unspoiled seashore remaining in the United States. They provide the public with almost unlimited opportunities for recreational activities, like swimming, surfing and hiking; for outdoor sports, like hunting, fishing, clamming, and boating; for the observation of nature as it existed for hundreds of years before the arrival of Europeans; and for relaxation away from the pressures and tensions of modern life. In past years, these recreational activities have been enjoyed by countless Washington citizens, as well as by tourists from other states and countries. The number of people wishing to participate in such recreational activities grows annually. This increasing public pressure makes it necessary that the state dedicate the use of the ocean beaches to public recreation and to provide certain recreational and sanitary facilities. Nonrecreational use of the beach must be strictly limited. Even recreational uses must be regulated in order that Washington's unrivaled seashore may be saved for our children in much the same form as we know it today.

## 79A.05.700 - Declaration.
The Green River Gorge, between the town of Kanasket and the Kummer bridge in King county, is a twelve mile spectacularly winding gorge with steep to overhanging rock walls reaching heights of from one hundred fifty to three hundred feet. The beauty and natural features of the gorge are generally confined within the canyon rim. This twelve mile gorge area contains many examples of unique biological and geological features for educational and recreational interpretation, almost two miles of Eocene sediment rocks and fossils are exposed revealing one of the most complete stratographic sections to be found in the region. The area, a unique recreational attraction with more than one million seven hundred thousand people living within an hour's driving time, is presently used by hikers, geologists, fishers, kayakers and canoeists, picnickers and swimmers, and those seeking the solitude offered by this unique area. Abutting and adjacent landowners generally have kept the gorge lands in their natural state; however, economic and urbanization pressures for development are rapidly increasing. Local and state outdoor recreation plans show a regional need for resources and facilities which could be developed in this area. A twelve-mile strip incorporating the visual basins of the Green river from the Kummer bridge to Palmer needs to be acquired and developed as a conservation area to preserve this unique area for the recreational needs of the region.

## 79A.05.725 - Legislative declaration.
Mt. Si and Little Si in King county offer unique scenic, natural, and geological features which can be viewed from the I-90 highway. They also afford outstanding recreational opportunities enjoyed by the citizens of this state and tourists alike. The legislature recognizes the importance of guarding portions of this area from those types of development which would permanently alter the area's natural form and beauty. It further recognizes the necessity of setting forth procedures to manage the area, to enhance the opportunities afforded the state's citizens, one-half of whom live within one-half hour driving time of Mt. Si, and to safeguard to the extent possible the scenic, natural, geological, game habitat, and recreational values therein, and to safeguard and promote the upper Snoqualmie River valley's economy in which the recreational use of Mt. Si plays a pivotal role. Therefore, the legislature declares this area to be of statewide significance for the foregoing purposes to be enhanced and safeguarded in accordance with the procedures set forth in chapter 306, Laws of 1977 ex. sess.

    a. No more than five thousand dollars for individual easement crossings that are no longer than one mile in length;

    b. No more than twelve thousand five hundred dollars for individual easement crossings that are more than one but less than five miles in length; or

    c. No more than twenty thousand dollars for individual easement crossings that are five miles or more in length.

2. The term of the easement is thirty years or a period of less than thirty years if requested by the person or entity seeking the easement.

3. In addition to the charge for the easement under subsection (1) of this section, the commission may recover its administrative costs incurred in receiving an application for the easement, approving the easement, and reviewing plans for and construction of the public utility lines. For the purposes of this subsection, "administrative costs" is equivalent to twenty percent of the fee for the easement as determined under subsection (1) of this section. When multiple public utility lines are owned by the same entity and are authorized under the same easement, the administrative fee for the easement must be equal to twenty percent of the easement fee for the single longest public utility line. Administrative costs recovered by the commission must be deposited into the state parks renewal and stewardship account.

4. Applicants under this section providing a residence with an individual service connection for electrical, natural gas, cable television, or telecommunications service are not required to pay the charge for the easement under subsection (1) of this section but shall pay administrative costs under subsection (3) of this section.

5. A final decision on applications for an easement must be made within sixty days after the commission receives the completed application and after all applicable regulatory permits for the easement have been acquired. Upon request of the applicant, the commission may reach a decision on an application within thirty days and charge an additional fee for an expedited processing. The fee for an expedited processing is ten percent of the combined total of the easement charge and administrative costs.
