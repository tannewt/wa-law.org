# HB 1479 - Office of native ed. grants

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1479.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature recognizes the profound importance of preserving and nurturing the cultural heritage, traditions, and languages of American Indian and Alaska Native students. It is the intent of this act to support educational opportunities that affirm the identity, history, and contributions of American Indian and Alaska Native communities while fostering academic achievement.

The legislature acknowledges that it has intended to promote the full success of the centennial accord, signed by state and tribal government leaders in 1989, and the subsequent millennial accord in 1999. The legislature further recognizes that American Indian and Alaska Native students thrive in educational environments that honor their cultural heritage and provide meaningful connections to their land, language, and traditions. These connections are vital to building resilience, fostering a sense of belonging, and ensuring the success of future generations.

The legislature further recognizes that American Indian and Alaska Native students have historically been misidentified and underidentified as a result of federal policies that fail to count American Indian and Alaska Native students who have more than one racial identity. This underidentification is persistent in educational systems for support services, academic opportunities, and cultural programs, and stems from a complex history that includes the forced removal of indigenous cultures, languages, and identities through policies and practices that sought to assimilate Native peoples.

Therefore, the legislature intends to enact a state grant program to match the federal investment through the Title VI, Part A, Subpart 1 grant, which provides critical funding to school districts to meet the unique cultural, language, and educational needs of American Indian and Alaska Native students. This grant program aims to empower American Indian and Alaska Native students by supporting culturally relevant programming, enhancing access to resources, and strengthening partnerships between schools and tribal communities.

Through this act, the legislature reaffirms its commitment to addressing educational inequities and honoring the sovereignty, identity, and future of American Indian and Alaska Native people in Washington state.

## Section 2

3. State grant funds under this section may be used to support the education of American Indian and Alaska Native students and may enhance activities under federal grants. Objectives of the state grant include, but are not limited to:
