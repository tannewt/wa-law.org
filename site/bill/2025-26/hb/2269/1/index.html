    ii. Apply to middle housing the same development permit and environmental review processes that apply to detached single-family residences, unless otherwise required by state law, including, but not limited to, shoreline regulations under chapter 90.58 RCW, building codes under chapter 19.27 RCW, energy codes under chapter 19.27A RCW, or electrical codes under chapter 19.28 RCW; and

    iii. Require that middle housing in limited areas of more intensive rural development be served by a publicly owned sanitary sewer system or a large on-site sewage system.

    i. &quot;Rural county&quot; has the same meaning as in RCW 43.160.020; and
