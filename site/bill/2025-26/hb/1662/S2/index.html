<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the state board of education, the Washington professional educator standards board, the Washington state charter school commission, and the financial education public-private partnership were established as independent agencies at separate times, and have been administratively housed within the office of the superintendent of public instruction for purposes of administrative efficiency. The legislature also finds that because these education agencies have differing operational needs, they may be better served by an entity such as small agency services, which was established as a unit within the department of enterprise services in 2014 for the purpose of acting as the administrative agent for small agencies.</p>
<p>Further, the legislature finds that, in accordance with its intent in creating independent entities, these education agencies have unique policy and programmatic roles, and that it is in the public interest for them to be efficient and reliable in developing policies, providing services, and managing resources.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to remove the requirement obligating the state board of education, the Washington professional educator standards board, the Washington state charter school commission, and the financial education public-private partnership to reside in the office of the superintendent of public instruction for administrative purposes, and to promote their transition to operational independence and the securing of administrative services in a manner that optimizes each agency's business needs efficiently and effectively.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In order to ensure an effective and efficient transition of administrative services, and in recognition of their independent status, beginning in July 2026, the office of financial management shall coordinate with the office of the superintendent of public instruction, the state board of education, the Washington professional educator standards board, the financial education public-private partnership, and the Washington state charter school commission for the purposes of supporting a transition to operational independence with separate administrative services. The office of financial management shall also coordinate with other agencies as necessary to implement this section. Transition supports to these education agencies must include, but are not limited to, assistance establishing accounts and agreements for state administrative services with small agency services, the state auditor's office, the attorney general's office, and other necessary entities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state board of education, the Washington professional educator standards board, the financial education public-private partnership, and the Washington state charter school commission shall each establish policies, procedures, and controls necessary to transition to operational independence with separate administration of each education agency's business services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall provide administrative services at a level commensurate with the business needs for each education agency listed in subsection (2) of this section through the 2027 fiscal year, and provide each agency with necessary information and documentation in time to meet their planning needs and ensure an effective and efficient transition to operational independence with separate administrative services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<p>Effective July 1, 2027, the state board of education, the Washington professional educator standards board, the financial education public-private partnership, and the Washington state charter school commission shall exercise their authority to operate independently and make provisions for separate administrative services. In implementing the requirements of this section, these education agencies may contract for all or any portion of their administrative services.</p>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of the state board of education, an independent state agency with statutory origins predating statehood, is to provide advocacy and strategic oversight of public education; implement a standards-based accountability framework that creates a unified system of increasing levels of support for schools in order to improve student academic achievement; provide leadership in the creation of a system that personalizes education for each student and respects diverse cultures, abilities, and learning styles; and promote achievement of the goals of RCW 28A.150.210. In addition to any other powers and duties as provided by law, the state board of education shall:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Hold regularly scheduled meetings at such time and place within the state as the board shall determine and may hold such special meetings as may be deemed necessary for the transaction of public business;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Form committees as necessary to effectively and efficiently conduct the work of the board;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seek advice from the public and interested parties regarding the work of the board;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish and enforce minimum high school graduation requirements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of statewide accountability:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Adopt and revise performance improvement goals in reading, writing, science, and mathematics, by subject and grade level, once assessments in these subjects are required statewide; academic and technical skills, as appropriate, in secondary career and technical education programs; and student attendance, as the board deems appropriate to improve student learning. The goals shall be consistent with student privacy protection provisions of RCW 28A.655.090(7) and shall not conflict with requirements contained in Title I of the federal elementary and secondary education act of 1965, or the requirements of the Carl D. Perkins vocational education act of 1998, each as amended. The goals may be established for all students, economically disadvantaged students, limited English proficient students, students with disabilities, and students who are not meeting academic standards as defined in RCW 28A.165.015, disaggregated as described in RCW 28A.300.042(1) for student-level data. The board may establish school and school district goals addressing high school graduation rates and dropout reduction goals for students in grades seven through 12. The board shall adopt the goals by rule. However, before each goal is implemented, the board shall present the goal to the education committees of the house of representatives and the senate for the committees' review and comment in a time frame that will permit the legislature to take statutory action on the goal if such action is deemed warranted by the legislature;</p>
</li>

<p>i.(A) Identify the scores students must achieve in order to meet the standard on the statewide student assessment, and the SAT or the ACT if used to demonstrate career and college readiness under RCW 28A.230.710. The board shall also determine student scores that identify levels of student performance below and beyond the standard. The board shall set such performance standards and levels in consultation with the superintendent of public instruction and after consideration of any recommendations that may be developed by any advisory committees that may be established for this purpose;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(B) To permit the legislature to take any statutory action it deems warranted before modified or newly established scores are implemented, the board shall notify the education committees of the house of representatives and the senate of any scores that are modified or established under (b)(i)(A) of this subsection on or after July 28, 2019. The notifications required by this subsection (5)(b)(i)(B) must be provided by November 30th of the year proceeding the beginning of the school year in which the modified or established scores will take effect;</p>
<pre><code>    ii. The legislature intends to continue the implementation of chapter 22, Laws of 2013 2nd sp. sess. when the legislature expressed the intent for the state board of education to identify the student performance standard that demonstrates a student's career and college readiness for the 11th grade consortium-developed assessments. Therefore, by December 1, 2018, the state board of education, in consultation with the superintendent of public instruction, must identify and report to the governor and the education policy and fiscal committees of the legislature on the equivalent student performance standard that a 10th grade student would need to achieve on the state assessments to be on track to be career and college ready at the end of the student's high school experience;

    iii. The legislature shall be advised of the initial performance standards and any changes made to the elementary, middle, and high school level performance standards. The board must provide an explanation of and rationale for all initial performance standards and any changes, for all grade levels of the statewide student assessment. If the board changes the performance standards for any grade level or subject, the superintendent of public instruction must recalculate the results from the previous 10 years of administering that assessment regarding students below, meeting, and beyond the state standard, to the extent that this data is available, and post a comparison of the original and recalculated results on the superintendent's website;

c. Annually review the assessment reporting system to ensure fairness, accuracy, timeliness, and equity of opportunity, especially with regard to schools with special circumstances and unique populations of students, and a recommendation to the superintendent of public instruction of any improvements needed to the system; and

d. Include in the biennial report required under RCW 28A.305.035, information on the progress that has been made in achieving goals adopted by the board;
