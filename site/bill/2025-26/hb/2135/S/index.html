The total amount of a remittance that an eligible purchaser may receive under this section and RCW 82.12.0207 is limited to $5,000 for each adapted housing project. The remittance under this section is for the state portion of the sales tax only.</p>

<p>An eligible purchaser claiming an exemption from tax in the form of a remittance under this section must pay the tax imposed by RCW 82.08.020 on such purchases eligible for the remittance. The eligible purchaser may then apply to the department for remittance of all or part of the tax paid under RCW 82.08.020 on such purchases, subject to the limits in subsections (1) and (3) of this section. As part of the application, the eligible purchaser must provide proof of eligibility for the remittance in the form of a copy of the grant award letter from the United States department of veterans affairs, construction contracts for adapted housing, and invoices for purchases qualifying for a remittance under this section.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning in fiscal year 2028, the individual remittance amount in subsection (1) of this section and the statewide total remittance amount in (a) of this subsection (3) must be adjusted annually based on the United States bureau of labor statistics' consumer price index for the Seattle area, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of labor.</p>

<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<p>(1)(a) The legislature finds that it is important to recognize the service of veterans and to acknowledge the continued sacrifice of those veterans who have service-connected physical disabilities. The legislature further finds that many disabled veterans often need customized, accessible housing in order to be self-sufficient and to maintain a high quality of life. The legislature further finds that disabled veterans have higher poverty rates than disabled nonveterans. The legislature further finds that the federal government provides a grant to assist disabled veterans with the costs of constructing, modifying, or adapting their homes, but that thousands of these dollars end up covering the sales or use tax owed on these construction projects. The legislature further finds that this results in a shift of cost to the same population of disabled veterans whose burden the federal grant program is intended to ease.</p>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<p>This act takes effect July 1, 2026.</p>
