<p>The uniform disciplinary act, chapter 18.130 RCW, governs the unlicensed practice as a health care administrator, the issuance and denial of licenses, and the discipline of health care administrators under this chapter.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Fiscal or operational decisions which result in injury to a patient or create an unreasonable risk that a patient may be harmed;</p>
</li>

<p>A violation by a licensed health care provider of a state or federal statute or administrative rule regulating a profession, as provided in RCW 18.130.180(7), when the licensed health care administrator was responsible for the oversight of the licensed health care provider;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aiding or abetting a licensed health care provider to practice their health care profession after a patient complaint or adverse event has been reported to the hospital employing the licensed health care administrator, the department, or the appropriate disciplining authority, while the complaint or adverse event is being investigated, and if harm, disability, or death of a patient occurred after the complaint or report of the adverse event;</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>When issuing sanctions under RCW 18.130.160, the disciplining authority shall give consideration to the extent to which the licensed health care administrator who is the subject of the disciplinary matter had the ability to exercise control within the hospital's operational structure regulating the policies and financial decisions that resulted in the act of unprofessional conduct. As appropriate, the disciplining authority may consider it to be a mitigating factor if a licensed health care administrator had limited authority or discretion to act regarding hospital policies and financial decisions.</p>
