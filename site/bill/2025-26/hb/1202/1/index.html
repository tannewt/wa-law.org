<p>For the purpose of providing funds to finance the projects described and authorized by the legislature in the omnibus capital and operating appropriations acts for the 2023-2025 and 2025-2027 fiscal biennia and future biennia, and all costs incidental thereto, the state finance committee is authorized to issue general obligation bonds of the state of Washington in the sum of $4,981,981,000, or as much thereof as may be required, to finance these projects and all costs incidental thereto. Bonds authorized in this section may be sold at such price as the state finance committee shall determine. No bonds authorized in this section may be offered for sale without prior legislative appropriation of the net proceeds of the sale of the bonds.</p>

The state treasurer, on behalf of the state finance committee, shall submit written notice to the director of the office of financial management if it is determined that any such additional transfer to the state taxable building construction account or any other taxable bond accounts is necessary or that a transfer from the state taxable building construction account to the state building construction account or any other nontaxable bond accounts may be made.
