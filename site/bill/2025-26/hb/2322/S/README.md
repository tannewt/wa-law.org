# HB 2322 - Alternative jet fuel

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2322-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. Constructing alternative jet fuel production facilities requires significant capital investment and long development timelines;

    b. Encouraging and supporting the production and use of alternative jet fuel, also known as sustainable aviation fuel, supports the achievement of the state's emissions limits and the goals of state climate policies such as the clean fuels program, climate commitment act, and clean energy transformation act by taking advantage of our legacy and new renewable resources and providing certainty in accessing the available economic incentives targeted to reduce the carbon intensity of aviation fuel; and

    c. The terms "alternative jet fuel," "sustainable aviation fuel," "production," and "manufacturing" are used in various statutes with similar meanings for defining the production and end use of low carbon, nonfossil fuel-based jet fuel. This finding is not intended to alter the definitions of these terms as used in those statutes, but rather to encourage similar interpretation of these terms when encountered in statute or rule.

2. Therefore, the legislature intends to:

    a. Encourage the production and use of alternative jet fuel in the state; and

    b. Provide clarity and a date certain for the availability of existing production tax incentives. Given the long lead times required for feasibility, permitting, and construction that precede fuel production and commercial use, providing a date certain to the availability of existing alternative jet fuel production tax credits will lower barriers for, and reduce the risk to, early capital investment decisions, thereby enabling and accelerating the production and use of alternative jet fuel in the state.

3. The legislature further intends that the carbon intensity and renewable attributes of the energy purchased for alternative jet fuel production processes is assigned those attributes reported in the tariff, rate schedule, power purchase agreement, or utility-specific contract or that utility's fuel mix disclosure report under which the energy was purchased, and attributed for all processes using that energy in the alternative jet fuel production process.

## Section 2
1. Upon every person engaging within the state in the business of manufacturing alternative jet fuel; as to such persons, the amount of the tax with respect to such business is, in the case of manufacturers, equal to the value of the product manufactured, or in the case of processors for hire, equal to the gross income of the business, multiplied by the rate of 0.275 percent.

2. Upon every person engaging in making sales, at retail or wholesale, of manufactured alternative jet fuel; as to such persons, the amount of the tax with respect to such business is equal to the gross proceeds of sales of the alternative jet fuel, multiplied by the rate of 0.275 percent.

3. For the purposes of this section:

    a. "Alternative jet fuel" means a fuel that can be blended and used with conventional petroleum jet fuels without the need to modify aircraft engines and existing fuel distribution infrastructure and that has lower greenhouse gas emissions based on a full life-cycle analysis when compared to conventional petroleum jet fuel for which it is capable as serving as a substitute, as certified by the department of ecology :

        i. Using the methods for determining the carbon intensity of fuels under chapter 70A.535 RCW, for a producer that elects to participate in the clean fuels program pursuant to RCW 70A.535.030(5); or

        ii. For persons not electing to participate in the clean fuels program pursuant to RCW 70A.535.030(5), using the following methods for determining the carbon intensity:

(A) For the electricity used in the fuel production process, the carbon intensity is determined for the electricity supplied in the rate schedule, tariff, power purchase agreement, or utility-specific contract according to the fuel mix or generation type reported in the rate schedule, tariff, power purchase agreement, or utility-specific carbon intensity pursuant to the utility contract or fuel mix disclosure statement;

(B) The carbon intensity for solar, wind, hydropower, nonemitting generation, renewable hydrogen and ocean power must be considered zero;

(C) The specific carbon intensity is applicable to the electricity used for all production processes of the alternative jet fuel manufacturing facility involved in manufacturing or producing alternative jet fuel.

    b. "Alternative jet fuel" includes jet fuels derived from coprocessed feedstocks at a conventional petroleum refinery as certified by the department of ecology using the methods for determining the carbon intensity of fuels under chapter 70A.535 RCW.

4. A person reporting under the tax rate provided in this section must file a complete annual tax performance report with the department under RCW 82.32.534.
