Your landlord is not required to raise the rent or other recurring or periodic charges by any amount.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your landlord may be exempt from the limit on increases for rent and other recurring or periodic charges for the reasons described in RCW 59.18.710. If your landlord claims an exemption, your landlord is required to include supporting facts with this notice.</p>

(The landlord must include facts or attach documents supporting the exemption.)</p>

In addition to any other remedies or relief available under this chapter or other law, the tenant may terminate the rental agreement at any time prior to the effective date of the increase by providing the landlord with written notice at least 20 days before terminating the rental agreement.

<li>
<p>A landlord must provide parity between lease types with respect to the amount of rent charged for a specific dwelling unit. For the purposes of this subsection, &quot;parity between lease types&quot; means that, for leases or rental agreements that a landlord offers for a specific dwelling unit, the landlord may not charge a tenant more than a five percent difference in rent depending on the type of lease or rental agreement offered, regardless of whether the type of lease or rental agreement offered is on a month-to-month or other periodic basis or for a specified period.
