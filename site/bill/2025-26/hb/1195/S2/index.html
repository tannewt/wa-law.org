<li>
<p>A local comprehensive plan or development regulations, including permit processes, development standards, or permit conditions imposed under this chapter, chapter 43.21C RCW, or Title 35 or 35A RCW, may not deny or preclude a permit application for permanent supportive housing, transitional housing, indoor emergency housing, or indoor emergency shelter in any residential or commercial zone within an urban growth area that includes or is contiguous with a city.</p>

<li>
<p>If a permit applicant is unable to site permanent supportive housing, transitional housing, indoor emergency housing, or indoor emergency shelters due to a county or city comprehensive plan or development regulation, the applicant may seek a waiver of certain requirements from the local government to allow the siting of the facility. The permit applicant must describe any local permit processes, development standards, or permit conditions that the permit applicant asserts would deny or preclude the siting, construction, or operation of the proposed facility, including:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The specific local permit processes, development standards, or permit conditions that deny or preclude the siting, construction, or operation of the proposed facility;</p>

<li>
<p>The minimum waiver or relief to allow the siting, construction, or operation of the proposed facility.</p>
