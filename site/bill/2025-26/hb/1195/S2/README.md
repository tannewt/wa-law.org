## Section 1
1. A local comprehensive plan or development regulations, including permit processes, development standards, or permit conditions imposed under this chapter, chapter 43.21C RCW, or Title 35 or 35A RCW, may not deny or preclude a permit application for permanent supportive housing, transitional housing, indoor emergency housing, or indoor emergency shelter in any residential or commercial zone within an urban growth area that includes or is contiguous with a city.

2. A county or city must review for compliance any permit application for permanent supportive housing, transitional housing, indoor emergency housing, or indoor emergency shelters using an administrative process only.

3. [Empty]

    a. If a permit applicant is unable to site permanent supportive housing, transitional housing, indoor emergency housing, or indoor emergency shelters due to a county or city comprehensive plan or development regulation, the applicant may seek a waiver of certain requirements from the local government to allow the siting of the facility. The permit applicant must describe any local permit processes, development standards, or permit conditions that the permit applicant asserts would deny or preclude the siting, construction, or operation of the proposed facility, including:

        i. The specific local permit processes, development standards, or permit conditions that deny or preclude the siting, construction, or operation of the proposed facility;

        ii. How the identified processes, standards, or permit conditions preclude the siting, construction, or operation of the proposed facility; and

        iii. The minimum waiver or relief to allow the siting, construction, or operation of the proposed facility.

    b. If a county or city and a permit applicant disagree about the assertions, either party may request that the department provide dispute resolution services under section 2 of this act.

4. Nothing in this section requires a city or county to approve a permit application for permanent supportive housing, transitional housing, indoor emergency housing, or indoor emergency shelters that are located in a critical area, an area of natural hazards that generally prohibit residential development, or on agricultural, forest, or mineral lands of long-term commercial significance.

        i. Prevents the siting, construction, or operation of housing or shelter in violation of RCW 35.21.683, 35A.21.430, 36.130.020, or 36.70A.070(2)(c); or

## Section 3
1. A city shall not prohibit transitional housing or permanent supportive housing in any zones in which residential dwelling units or hotels are allowed.

Reasonable occupancy, spacing, and intensity of use requirements may be imposed by ordinance on permanent supportive housing, transitional housing, indoor emergency housing, and indoor emergency shelters to protect public health and safety. Any such requirements on occupancy, spacing, and intensity of use may not prevent the siting of a sufficient number of permanent supportive housing, transitional housing, indoor emergency housing, or indoor emergency shelters necessary to accommodate each code city's projected need for such housing and shelter under RCW 36.70A.070(2)(a)(ii).
