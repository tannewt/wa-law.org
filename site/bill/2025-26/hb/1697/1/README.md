# HB 1697 - Newborn screening additions

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1697.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature recognizes the critical importance of newborn screenings in identifying rare genetic and metabolic conditions that can otherwise go undiagnosed, leading to irreversible harm. The legislature recognizes the department of health's newborn screening program currently tests newborns for 32 rare congenital conditions through drops of blood collected within the first days and weeks of birth and funded through a one-time fee generally billed through the birthing facility. Further, the legislature recognizes that the federal recommended uniform screening panel is established and periodically updated through a science-based and deliberative review process by a national committee of experts in newborn screening and rare disease. It is the intent of the legislature that additions to the newborn screening panel be timely, efficient, and evidence-based, and that this be achieved by leveraging the recommended uniform screening panel, ensuring intra-agency coordination, requiring focused feasibility reviews, and ensuring fees collected for newborn screenings are readily available to implement the requirements under chapter 70.83 RCW. Furthermore, the legislature intends to protect the ability of the public to petition for additions to the newborn screening panel outside of the recommended uniform screening panel.

## Section 2
1. It shall be the duty of the department of health to require screening tests of all newborn infants born in any setting. Each hospital or health care provider attending a birth outside of a hospital shall collect and submit a sample blood specimen for all newborns no more than 48 hours following birth.

2. The department of health shall conduct screening tests of samples for the detection of the conditions listed in the newborn screening panel determined by the state board of health in rule as required under section 3 of this act: PROVIDED, That no such tests shall be given to any newborn infant whose parents or guardian object thereto on the grounds that such tests conflict with their religious tenets and practices.

3. The sample required in subsection (1) of this section must be received by the department of health within 72 hours of the collection of the sample, excluding any day that the Washington state public health laboratory is closed.

## Section 3
1. By July 1, 2026, the state board of health shall reestablish in rule the newborn screening panel that newborns must be screened under RCW 70.83.020. In reestablishing the initial newborn screening panel, the state board of health shall include:

    a. All conditions newborns must be screened for as required by the existing state board of health rules as of January 1, 2025;

    b. All conditions included in the existing federal recommended uniform screening panel as of January 1, 2025.

2. Within 12 months of the addition of a new condition to the federal recommended uniform screening panel, the state board of health shall determine whether to add that new condition to the newborn screening panel. In making its determination, the state board of health must avoid duplicating research and evaluation efforts leading to the addition of the condition to the federal recommended uniform screening panel, and complete and consider the findings of a feasibility review.

    a. The feasibility review must identify costs to screen for the condition, federal funding available to aid implementation of the screening of the new condition, recommendations of changes to the fee charged for the newborn screening, and a timeline for including the new condition on the newborn screening panel.

    b. In conducting the feasibility review, the board shall consult with the health care authority to ensure consideration of impacts on state purchased health care programs under chapter 41.05 RCW and medical care programs under chapter 74.09 RCW and with the department of health.

    c. If the board determines that the condition should be included in the newborn screening panel, the board shall complete rule making to include the condition in the newborn screening panel within 12 months of the determination.

3. Members of the public may request that the state board of health consider additions to the newborn screening panel.

    a. The board shall adopt standards for reviewing such requests to determine whether there is sufficient scientific evidence available to evaluate the proposed addition.

    b. For proposed additions that have sufficient scientific evidence to conduct an evaluation, the board shall conduct a feasibility review as described in subsection (2)(a) and (b) of this section.

    c. In addition to the feasibility review, the board must also consider:

        i. Whether screening technology exists that can be made available to mass screen newborns;

        ii. The availability of diagnostic testing, treatment, and interventions; and

        iii. The need for population-based rather than risk-based screening or other approaches.

    d. If the board determines that the condition should be included in the newborn screening panel, the board shall complete rule making to include the condition in the newborn screening panel within 12 months of the determination.

4. The board may add other new conditions to the newborn screening panel in rule if it completes the feasibility review as described in subsection (2)(a) and (b) of this section.

5. The board shall adopt rules as necessary to implement and administer this section.

## Section 4
1. The department of health under its authority in RCW 43.20B.020 may charge and collect a reasonable fee from parents, guardians, or responsible parties for the costs of newborn screening.

2. The department of health has the authority to collect a fee of $8.40 from the parents or other responsible party of each infant screened for congenital disorders as defined by the state board of health under RCW 70.83.020 to fund specialty clinics that provide treatment services for those with the defined disorders. The fee may also be used to support organizations conducting community outreach, education, and adult support related to sickle cell disease. The fee collected under this subsection is in addition to the fee collected by the department of health for the purposes of the newborn screening under subsection (1) of this section.

3. The fees authorized under this section may be collected through the facility where a screening specimen is obtained.

## Section 5
Laboratories, attending physicians, hospital administrators, or other persons performing or requesting the performance of tests for the diseases and conditions on the newborn screening panel under this chapter shall report to the department of health all positive tests.

## Section 6
The newborn screening revenue account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. All receipts collected under chapter 70.83 RCW must be deposited into the account. Expenditures from the account may only be used for activities directly related to implementing and administering chapter 70.83 RCW. Only the secretary or the secretary's designee may authorize expenditure from the account. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures.

## Section 7
(1) Money in the treasurer's trust fund may be deposited, invested, and reinvested by the state treasurer in accordance with RCW 43.84.080 in the same manner and to the same extent as if the money were in the state treasury, and may be commingled with moneys in the state treasury for cash management and cash balance purposes.

## Section 8
(1) Money in the treasurer's trust fund may be deposited, invested, and reinvested by the state treasurer in accordance with RCW 43.84.080 in the same manner and to the same extent as if the money were in the state treasury, and may be commingled with moneys in the state treasury for cash management and cash balance purposes.

## Section 9
Section 7 of this act expires July 1, 2030.

## Section 10
Section 8 of this act takes effect July 1, 2030.
