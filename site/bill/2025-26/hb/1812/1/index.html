<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that anesthesia providers give individualized care to every patient, carefully assessing the patient's health prior to the surgery, looking at existing diseases and medical conditions to determine the resources and medical expertise needed, attending to the patient during the entire procedure, resolving unexpected complications that may arise and/or extend the duration of the surgery, and working to ensure that the patient is comfortable during recovery.</p>
<p>The legislature intends for this act to safeguard patient safety, uphold patient-centered care, and promote transparency and safety in anesthesia reimbursement practices by ensuring fair and ethical access to medically necessary anesthesia services. This act is critical to protecting patient safety and preventing the disturbing trend of commercial health insurers imposing time caps or physical status caps for anesthesia during surgery, leading to dangerous practices that could jeopardize lives. This year, insurers have targeted some of the most vulnerable patients receiving anesthesia care including those under the age of one, those over the age of 70, those in emergency conditions, and those with severe systemic diseases or illnesses.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to address the alarming potential for insurance companies to impose arbitrary time limits or slash reimbursements based on the duration of care or patient physical status, prioritizing profit over patient well-being. By mandating consistent and dependable access to medically necessary anesthesia services, the legislature intends to provide safeguards to protect patient-centered care and allow health care providers to deliver safe, high quality care without undue interference or financial coercion.</p>
<p>Because the legislature finds that immediate action is necessary to protect the ability of health care providers to deliver medically necessary health care services to Washingtonians, this act is deemed necessary for the immediate preservation of the public health, welfare, peace, and safety.</p>

<li>
<p>Health carriers for each health plan shall provide coverage for necessary anesthesia services for any procedure covered by the health plan, regardless of the duration of anesthesia care.

</li>
<li>
<p>Reimbursement for anesthesia services by health carriers must be determined based solely on necessity as assessed by the physician or certified registered nurse anesthetist. Health carriers are prohibited from:</p>

<li>
<p>Imposing arbitrary time-based limits or any other cap on reimbursement for anesthesia services provided during procedures requiring anesthesia care;</p>

<li>
<p>Imposing unilateral or arbitrary time limits on coverage or reimbursement for anesthesia services; and</p>

<p>Suspend or revoke the health carrier's license to operate within the state of Washington for repeated or egregious violations; or</p>
