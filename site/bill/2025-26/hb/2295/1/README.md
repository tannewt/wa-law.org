## Section 6088
The following acts or parts of acts are each repealed:

## Section 8001
RCW 43.88.031 requires the disclosure of the estimated debt service costs associated with new capital bond appropriations. The estimated debt service costs for the appropriations contained in this act are $73,258,483 $46,425,516 for the 2025-2027 biennium, $410,061,655 $390,379,123 for the 2027-2029 biennium, and $631,176,449 $584,977,090 for the 2029-2031 biennium.

## Section 8002
(1) The following agencies may enter into financial contracts, paid from any funds of an agency, appropriated or nonappropriated, for the purposes indicated and in not more than the principal amounts indicated, plus financing expenses and required reserves pursuant to chapter 39.94 RCW. When securing properties under this section, agencies shall use the most economical financial contract option available, including long-term leases, lease-purchase agreements, lease-development with option to purchase agreements or financial contracts using certificates of participation. Expenditures made by an agency for one of the indicated purposes before the issue date of the authorized financial contract and any certificates of participation therein are intended to be reimbursed from proceeds of the financial contract and any certificates of participation therein to the extent provided in the agency's financing plan approved by the state finance committee.

## Section 8003
(1) The legislature finds that use of life-cycle cost analysis will aid public entities, architects, engineers, and contractors in making design and construction decisions that positively impact both the initial construction cost and the ongoing operating and maintenance cost of a project. To ensure that the total cost of a project is accounted for and the most reasonable and cost efficient design is used, agencies shall develop life-cycle costs for any construction project over $10,000,000. The life-cycle costs must represent the present value sum of capital costs, installation costs, operating costs, and maintenance costs over the life expectancy of the project. The legislature further finds the most effective approach to the life-cycle cost analysis is to integrate it into the early part of the design process.

## Section 8004
(1) For the 2025-2027 fiscal biennium, unless otherwise specified for a single purpose in this act or chapter 414, Laws of 2025, agencies are appropriated one lump sum for minor works projects. It is the intent of the legislature that appropriated funds be spent in the biennium for which they are appropriated.

## Section 8005
FOR THE STATE TREASURER—TRANSFERS

## Section 8006
It is the intent of the legislature to support the future construction of a new Washington state library-archives building for the office of the secretary of state.

## Section 8007
Any agency receiving appropriations in this act from climate commitment act accounts created in RCW 70A.65.240 through 70A.65.280 must report to and coordinate with the department of ecology to track expenditures as described in RCW 70A.65.300 and chapter 173-446B WAC. If an expenditure is expected to result in greenhouse gas emission reductions, the agency must use a department of ecology approved calculator tool or methodology.

## Section 8008
2025 c 414 s 8020 (uncodified) is repealed.

## Section 8009
If any part of this act is found to be in conflict with federal requirements that are a prescribed condition to the allocation of federal funds to the state, the conflicting part of this act is inoperative solely to the extent of the conflict and with respect to the agencies directly affected, and this finding does not affect the operation of the remainder of this act in its application to the agencies concerned. Rules adopted under this act must meet federal requirements that are a necessary condition to the receipt of federal funds by the state.

## Section 8010
If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.

## Section 8011
This act is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, or support of the state government and its existing public institutions, and takes effect immediately.
