# HB 2576 - Address confidentiality prg.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2576.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that persons attempting to escape from  domestic violence, harassment, sexual assault, stalking, or trafficking frequently establish new addresses in order to prevent their assailants  from finding them. This new address, however, is only useful if an assailant does not discover it. The purpose of this chapter is to enable state and local agencies to accept the address designated by the secretary of state as the participant's actual address, to respond to requests for public records without disclosing the location of a victim , and to enable interagency cooperation with the secretary of state in providing address confidentiality for victims . The legislature further intends to provide assistance to program participants who own or desire to own property in the state to protect such ownership from public disclosure.

## Section 2
Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter.

The Washington state patrol may not use the information or make the information available for inspection and copying for any other purpose than authorized in RCW 80.36.570. The secretary of state may adopt rules to make available the information required for the purposes of this section and RCW 80.36.570. The secretary of state and the secretary of state's officers, employees, or custodian, are not liable, nor shall a cause of action exist, for any loss or damage based upon the release of information, or the nondisclosure of information, from the address confidentiality program to the Washington state patrol if the agency, officer, employee, or custodian acted in good faith in attempting to comply with the provisions of this section and RCW 80.36.570.
