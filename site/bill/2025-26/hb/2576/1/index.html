<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that persons attempting to escape from  domestic violence, harassment, sexual assault, stalking, or trafficking frequently establish new addresses in order to prevent their assailants  from finding them. This new address, however, is only useful if an assailant does not discover it. The purpose of this chapter is to enable state and local agencies to accept the address designated by the secretary of state as the participant's actual address, to respond to requests for public records without disclosing the location of a victim , and to enable interagency cooperation with the secretary of state in providing address confidentiality for victims . The legislature further intends to provide assistance to program participants who own or desire to own property in the state to protect such ownership from public disclosure.</p>
