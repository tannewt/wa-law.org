<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>No petition or motion for collateral attack on a judgment and sentence in a criminal case may be filed more than three years after the judgment becomes final if the judgment and sentence is valid on its face and was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;collateral attack&quot; means any form of postconviction relief other than a direct appeal. &quot;Collateral attack&quot; includes, but is not limited to, a personal restraint petition, a habeas corpus petition, a motion to vacate judgment, a motion to withdraw guilty plea, a motion for a new trial, and a motion to arrest judgment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, a judgment becomes final on the last of the following dates:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The date it is filed with the clerk of the trial court;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The date that an appellate court issues its mandate disposing of a timely direct appeal from the conviction; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The date that the United States Supreme Court denies a timely petition for certiorari to review a decision affirming the conviction on direct appeal. The filing of a motion to reconsider denial of certiorari does not prevent a judgment from becoming final.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>As soon as practicable after the effective date of this section, the department of corrections shall attempt to advise the following persons of the time limit specified in RCW 10.73.090 and 10.73.100: Every person who, on the effective date of this section,  is serving a term of incarceration, probation, parole, or community supervision pursuant to conviction of a felony.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The state of Washington may not be held liable for any claim arising from the provision of pro bono legal services by the employees of the office of public defense.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
