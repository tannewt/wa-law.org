<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes that every Washingtonian should have access to trusted, noncommercial media that informs, educates, and connects our communities. The legislature further recognizes that media is a valuable commodity that contributes to the vitality of the state and the cultural integrity of the state's communities.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that noncommercial media provides a significant public benefit by providing information related to public safety, emergency broadcasting, public service announcements, community events, and educational partnerships.</p>
<p>The legislature also finds that increased funding for noncommercial media's annual operations and projects will likely increase revenue for rural economies and local businesses and create opportunities to increase community connection and build a diverse workforce. The legislature recognizes that different regions of the state have different needs, and residents should have the autonomy to discern and craft strategies to meet their regional needs while coordinating with each other and statewide.</p>
<p>The legislature also finds an urgent need to engage and educate communities for coordination of existing resources, capacity building, and establishing groundwork to support digital equity for more coordinated emergency services, efficiencies, partnerships, streamlined data collection, and group fund development that will contribute to regional economic development in a manner that is multilingual and culturally responsive.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to establish new funding for public media and digital equity.</p>
