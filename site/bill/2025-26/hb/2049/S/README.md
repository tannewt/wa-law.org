# HB 2049 - K-12 education funding

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2049-S.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature further finds that school funding obligations require an adjustment to levy equalization methods to ensure equitable funding for our state's public schools. Increasing local flexibility requires the state to ensure equitable funding for historically underinvested areas of our state, including rural school districts, mitigating widening funding gaps between schools.

Therefore, it is the legislature's intent to increase the levy authority for state and local property tax limits from one percent to three percent to ensure investments in public K-12 schools and public safety improving community resiliency. The legislature further intends to adjust the school funding formula to ensure appropriate funding for schools so that all Washington children receive the quality education afforded to them under our Constitution.
