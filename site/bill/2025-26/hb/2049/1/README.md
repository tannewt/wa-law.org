# HB 2049 - K-12 education funding

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2049.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature further finds that school funding obligations require an adjustment to levy equalization methods to ensure equitable funding for our state's public schools. Increasing local flexibility requires the state to ensure equitable funding for historically underinvested areas of our state, including rural school districts, mitigating widening funding gaps between schools.

Therefore, it is the legislature's intent to increase the levy authority for state and local property tax limits from one percent to three percent to ensure investments in public K-12 schools and public safety improving community resiliency. The legislature further intends to adjust the school funding formula to ensure appropriate funding for schools so that all Washington children receive the quality education afforded to them under our Constitution.

    b. If the federal safety net awards based on the federal eligibility threshold exceed the federal appropriation in any fiscal year, then the superintendent shall expend all available federal discretionary funds necessary to meet this need.

2. Safety net funds shall be awarded by the state safety net oversight committee subject to the following conditions and limitations:

    a. The committee shall award additional funds for districts that can convincingly demonstrate that all legitimate expenditures for special education exceed all available revenues from state funding formulas. When determining award eligibility and amounts, the committee shall limit its review to relevant documentation that illustrates adherence to award criteria. The committee shall not make determinations regarding the content of individualized education programs beyond confirming documented and quantified services and evidence of corresponding expenditures for which a school district seeks reimbursement.

    b. In the determination of need, the committee shall consider additional available revenues from federal sources.

    c. Differences in program costs attributable to district philosophy, service delivery choice, or accounting practices are not a legitimate basis for safety net awards.

    d. In the determination of need, the committee shall require that districts demonstrate that they are maximizing their eligibility for all state revenues related to services for students eligible for special education and all federal revenues from federal impact aid, medicaid, and the individuals with disabilities education act-Part B and appropriate special projects. Awards associated with (e)  of this subsection shall not exceed the total of a district's specific determination of need.

    e. The committee shall then consider the extraordinary high cost needs of one or more individual students eligible for and receiving special education. Differences in costs attributable to district philosophy, service delivery choice, or accounting practices are not a legitimate basis for safety net awards.

    f.

The committee shall then consider the extraordinary high cost needs of one or more individual students eligible for and receiving special education served in residential schools, programs for juveniles under the department of corrections, and programs for juveniles operated by city and county jails to the extent they are providing a secondary program of education.

    g. The maximum allowable indirect cost for calculating safety net eligibility may not exceed the federal restricted indirect cost rate for the district plus one percent.

    h. Safety net awards shall be adjusted based on the percent of potential medicaid eligible students billed as calculated by the superintendent of public instruction in accordance with chapter 318, Laws of 1999.

        i. Safety net awards must be adjusted for any unresolved audit findings or exceptions related to special education funding. Safety net awards may only be adjusted for errors in safety net applications or individualized education programs that materially affect the demonstration of need.

3. The superintendent of public instruction shall adopt such rules and procedures as are necessary to administer the special education funding and safety net award process. By December 1, 2018, the superintendent shall review and revise the rules to achieve full and complete implementation of the requirements of this subsection and subsection (4) of this section including revisions to rules that provide additional flexibility to access community impact awards. Before revising any standards, procedures, or rules, the superintendent shall consult with the office of financial management and the fiscal committees of the legislature. In adopting and revising the rules, the superintendent shall ensure the application process to access safety net funding is streamlined, timelines for submission are not in conflict, feedback to school districts is timely and provides sufficient information to allow school districts to understand how to correct any deficiencies in a safety net application, and that there is consistency between awards approved by school district and by application period. The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall also provide technical assistance to school districts in preparing and submitting special education safety net applications.

4. [Empty]

    a. On an annual basis, the superintendent shall survey districts regarding their satisfaction with the safety net process and consider feedback from districts to improve the safety net process. Each year by December 1st, the superintendent shall prepare and submit a report to the office of financial management and the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the legislature that summarizes the survey results and those changes made to the safety net process as a result of the school district feedback.

    b. By December 1, 2024, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must develop a survey requesting specific feedback on the safety net application process from school districts with 3,000 or fewer students. The survey must include, at a minimum, questions regarding the average amount of time school district staff spend gathering safety net application data, filling out application forms, and correcting application deficiencies. The survey must also include questions to help identify which application components are the most challenging and time consuming for school districts to complete. By December 1, 2025, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must use this feedback to implement a simplified, standardized safety net application for all school districts that reduces barriers to safety net funding.

5. The safety net oversight committee appointed by the superintendent of public instruction shall consist of:

    a. One staff member from the office of the superintendent of public instruction;

    b. Staff of the office of the state auditor who shall be nonvoting members of the committee; and

2. The superintendent of public instruction shall develop an allocation and cost accounting methodology to account for expenditures beyond amounts provided through the special education funding formula under RCW 28A.150.390. This method of accounting must shift 30 percent of a school district's base allocation as defined in RCW 28A.150.390 for students eligible for and receiving special education to the school district's special education program for expenditure.

3. To the extent that a school district's special education program expenditures exceed state funding in a school year provided under RCW 28A.150.390 and 28A.150.392, and redirected general apportionment revenue under subsection (2) of this section, the school district must use the remaining portion of the school district's base allocation as defined in RCW 28A.150.390 for students eligible for and receiving special education for the expenditures prior to using other funding sources.

4. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, nothing in this section prohibits school districts from using other funding and state allocations above the amounts provided under RCW 28A.150.390 and subsections (2) and (3) of this section to serve students eligible for and receiving special education.

5. Nothing in this section requires districts to provide services in a manner inconsistent with the student's individualized education program or other than in the least restrictive environment as determined by the individualized education program team.

1. At a minimum, the work group's analysis must include:

    a. Impacts of changes to per-pupil funding formulas and local revenue;

    b. Compensation factors described in RCW 28A.150.412;

    c. Funding distribution trends resulting from the prototypical school funding formula; and

    d. Current formulas that benefit specific populations of students including, but not limited to, the learning assistance program, local effort assistance, and small school funding.

2. The superintendent of public instruction must use the work group's analysis conducted under subsection (1) of this section to consider options for revising state and local school funding formulas. By November 1, 2025, and annually thereafter through 2027, the superintendent of public instruction shall report the work group's progress and any proposed options to the education and fiscal committees of the legislature. The reports must include, but are not limited to, the following topics:

    a. Options for revisions to the funding formula that address system and resource inequities;

    b. Options that address state, local, and regional needs;

    c. The potential adoption of student weights to direct additional funding to students most in need; and

    d. Metrics for monitoring and accountability related to equitable access to resources.

3. The superintendent of public instruction may determine the size, membership, and meeting frequency of the work group. The work group must include representation from education and community partners that are demographically and geographically diverse including, but not limited to, groups representing educators, school and district administrators, labor unions, families, students, community partners who support groups disproportionately impacted by inequities, and legislators.

4. The estimated cost of an option or group of options proposed by the superintendent of public instruction under subsection (2) of this section must not exceed the estimated additional state revenue provided under section 4, chapter . . ., Laws of 2025 when combined with the estimated additional state funding allocated in this act. The department of revenue shall make available relevant data and analyses to the superintendent of public instruction to support the calculations under this subsection (4).
