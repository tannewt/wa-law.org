    b. Before award of a public works contract, a bidder shall submit to the contracting agency a signed statement in accordance with chapter 5.50 RCW verifying under penalty of perjury that the bidder is in compliance with the responsible bidder criteria requirement of subsection (1)(g) of this section. A contracting agency may reasonably rely upon such a sworn statement. The contracting agency shall verify that the bidder meets the remaining criteria in subsection (1) of this section through publicly available information on the department of labor and industries' website.

3. [Empty]

    a. In addition to the bidder responsibility criteria in subsection (1) of this section, for a project subject to apprentice utilization requirements under RCW 39.04.320, the bidder shall submit an apprentice utilization plan to the awarding agency before receiving the notice to proceed. However, a bidder is exempt from the requirements of this subsection if the bidder met or exceeded apprentice utilization requirements on the last public works project the bidder completed.

    b. The department of labor and industries shall develop an apprentice utilization plan template and make the template available to awarding agencies and bidders. The plan template must include, at minimum: The projected start and end dates of the project; estimated total work hours; estimated apprentice hours by apprenticeable occupation; list of state registered apprenticeship programs to be contacted; and list of estimated apprenticeship training agents or sponsors on the project. The plan template must also include educational material on apprentice utilization requirements, including how to access apprentices and contact apprenticeship programs and where to find additional and relevant resources. The department may approve the use of a template developed by an awarding agency if it meets the minimum requirements of this subsection.

4. In addition to the bidder responsibility criteria in subsection (1) of this section, the state or municipality may adopt relevant supplemental criteria for determining bidder responsibility applicable to a particular project which the bidder must meet.

    a. Supplemental criteria for determining bidder responsibility, including the basis for evaluation and the deadline for appealing a determination that a bidder is not responsible, must be provided in the invitation to bid or bidding documents.

    b. In a timely manner before the bid submittal deadline, a potential bidder may request that the state or municipality modify the supplemental criteria. The state or municipality must evaluate the information submitted by the potential bidder and respond before the bid submittal deadline. If the evaluation results in a change of the criteria, the state or municipality must issue an addendum to the bidding documents identifying the new criteria.

    c. If the bidder fails to supply information requested concerning responsibility within the time and manner specified in the bid documents, the state or municipality may base its determination of responsibility upon any available information related to the supplemental criteria or may find the bidder not responsible.

    d. If the state or municipality determines a bidder to be not responsible, the state or municipality must provide, in writing, the reasons for the determination. The bidder may appeal the determination within the time period specified in the bidding documents by presenting additional information to the state or municipality. The state or municipality must consider the additional information before issuing its final determination. If the final determination affirms that the bidder is not responsible, the state or municipality may not execute a contract with any other bidder until two business days after the bidder determined to be not responsible has received the final determination.

5. The capital projects advisory review board created in RCW 39.10.220 shall develop suggested guidelines to assist the state and municipalities in developing supplemental bidder responsibility criteria. The guidelines must be posted on the board's website.
