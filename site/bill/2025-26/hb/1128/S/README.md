# HB 1128 - Child care workforce board

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1128-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds and declares the following:

    a. High quality child care and early learning enable parents to go to work, keeping the economy going at all levels and returning six dollars in value for every one dollar invested. High quality early learning services help prepare children for success in school and in life. A high quality child care and early learning system depends on a thriving, healthy, and competitively compensated workforce. Current conditions for child care workers have resulted in lack of access, unaffordable prices, and poorer outcomes for children and families;

    b. Low compensation and poor working conditions impair the health, efficiency, and well-being of persons employed to provide child care, constitute unfair competition against other employers and their employees, threaten the stability of the child care market, create economic instability for providers, and result in a provider workforce that must rely in public and private assistance to support their own families;

    c. The fissured nature of child care workplaces exacerbates these conditions and create barriers preventing workers from being able to address these problems on their own; and

    d. Employment under these conditions threatens the health and well-being of the people of Washington and injures the overall economy.

2. Therefore, it is the declared policy of the state that such working conditions for child care workers be eliminated as rapidly as practicable through establishment of a workforce standards board comprised of employer and worker representatives and state agency representatives to set minimum compensation and other employment standards.

3. To ensure the state's policy goals are achieved, it is essential that child care workers are informed of their rights at work and under this act; are encouraged and able to freely participate in standard setting through the workforce standards board process; and are protected against any retaliation for such participation.

    a. The board must adopt rules establishing minimum child care employment standards that are reasonably necessary and appropriate to protect the health and safety of child care workers, to ensure that child care workers are properly trained about and fully informed of their rights under this chapter, and to otherwise satisfy the purposes of this act. Standards established by the board must include, as appropriate, standards on compensation and other working conditions for child care workers. In establishing standards under this section, the board must establish statewide standards and may adopt standards that apply to specific child care occupations or geographic regions.

    b. The board may not adopt standards regarding licensing of child care facilities.

    c. The board must adopt rules establishing initial standards for wages for child care workers no later than August 1, 2026. The board shall consult with the department in the development of these standards prior to beginning the rule adoption process.

    d. To the extent that any minimum standards that the board finds are reasonably necessary and appropriate to protect the health and safety of child care workers fall within the jurisdiction of chapter 49.17 RCW, the board shall not adopt rules establishing the standards but shall instead recommend the occupational health and safety standards to the director. The director shall initiate rule making under chapter 49.17 RCW on child care health and safety standards as recommended by the board, unless the director determines that the recommended standard is outside the statutory authority of the department, is already covered under existing standards, presents enforceability challenges, is infeasible to implement, or is otherwise unlawful and issues a written explanation of this determination.

2. [Empty]

    a. The board must investigate market conditions and the existing wages, benefits, and working conditions of child care workers for specific geographic areas of the state and specific child care occupations. Based on this information, the board must seek to adopt minimum child care employment standards that meet or exceed existing industry conditions for a majority of child care workers in the relevant geographic area and child care occupation. Except as provided in (c) of this subsection, initial employment standards established by the board are effective beginning January 1, 2027, and remain in effect until any subsequent standards are adopted by rules.

    b. The board may consider the following types of information in making determinations that employment standards are reasonably necessary to protect the health and welfare of child care workers:

        i. Wage rate and benefit data collected by or submitted to the board for child care workers in the relevant geographic area and child care occupations;

        ii. Statements showing wage rates and benefits paid to child care workers in the relevant geographic area and child care occupations;

        iii. Signed collective bargaining agreements applicable to child care workers in the relevant geographic area and child care occupations;

        iv. Testimony and information from current and former child care workers, worker organizations, child care employers, parents of children currently in child care, and child care organizations;

    v. Local minimum employment standards;

    vi. Information submitted by or obtained from state and local government entities, including registries or data regarding employee training, recruitment, and retention;

    c. If the established child care employment standards result in an increase in costs for services covered under RCW 41.56.028, the standards are not effective until the legislature appropriates funding sufficient to cover the increase in costs. This subsection does not prohibit the state from providing funding to meet standards set by the board.

3. At least once every four years, the board shall:

    a. Conduct a full review of the adequacy of the minimum child care employment standards previously established by the board; and

    b. Following that review, adopt new rules, amend or repeal existing rules, or make recommendations to adopt new rules or amend or repeal existing rules for minimum child care employment standards, as appropriate to meet the purposes of this act.

4. [Empty]

    a. In the event of a conflict between a standard established by the board in rule and a rule adopted by another state agency, the rule adopted by the board applies to child care workers and child care employers.

    b. Notwithstanding (a) of this subsection, in the event of a conflict between a standard established by the board in rule and a rule adopted by another state agency, the rule adopted by the other state agency applies to child care workers and child care employers if the rule adopted by the other state agency is adopted after the board's standard and the rule adopted by the other state agency is more protective or beneficial than the board's standard.

    c. Notwithstanding (a) of this subsection, if the secretary of the department of children, youth, and families determines that a standard established by the board in rule or recommended by the board conflicts with requirements in federal regulations for child care certification or with state statutes or rules governing licensure of child care employers, the federal regulations or state child care licensure statutes or rules take precedence, and the conflicting board standard or rule does not apply to child care workers or child care employers. The secretary is required to provide a written explanation of the rule or recommendation and how it conflicts with the federal regulations.

5. Nothing in this act may be construed to:

    a. Limit the rights of parties to a collective bargaining agreement to bargain and agree with respect to child care employment standards; or

    b. Diminish the obligation of a child care employer to comply with any contract, collective bargaining agreement, or employment benefit program or plan that meets or exceeds, and does not conflict with, the minimum standards and requirements established by the board under this chapter.

## Section 7
1. A child care employer may not discharge, discipline, penalize, interfere with, threaten, restrain, coerce, or otherwise retaliate or discriminate against a child care worker because the person has exercised or attempted to exercise rights protected under this act, including but not limited to:

3. [Empty]

    a. If a child care employer takes adverse action against an employee or a former employee within 90 days of the employee engaging or attempting to engage in activities protected by this chapter, there is a rebuttable presumption that the adverse action is a retaliatory action in violation of this section.

    b. The presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of evidence that:

        i. The action was taken for other permissible reasons; and

        ii. The engaging or attempting to engage in activities protected by this chapter was not one of the substantial motivating factors in the adverse action.

4. A person found to have experienced retaliation in violation of this section is entitled to back pay and reinstatement to the person's previous position, wages, benefits, hours, and other conditions of employment.

Except as provided in section 4(4) (b) and (c) of this act, it is unlawful for a child care employer to employ a child care worker for lower wages than those established as the minimum child care employment standards or under any other working conditions that violate the minimum child care employment standards.

2. The director may investigate possible violations of this chapter or of the minimum child care employment standards established by the board whenever it has cause to believe that a violation has occurred, either on the basis of a report of a suspected violation or on the basis of any other credible information, including violations found during the course of an investigation.

3. [Empty]

    a. One or more child care workers deeming themselves to be injured by any act in violation of this chapter has a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin further violations, to obtain reinstatement, to recover the actual damages sustained by the person, together with the cost of suit including reasonable attorney fees.

    b. A child care worker found to have experienced retaliation in violation of section 7 of this act is entitled to back pay and reinstatement to the worker's previous position, wages, benefits, hours, and other conditions of employment. Filing a civil action under this subsection terminates the director's processing of the complaint under section 7 of this act.

    c. An agreement between a child care employer and child care worker or labor union that fails to meet the minimum standards and requirements in this chapter or established by the board is not a defense to an action brought under this subsection.

## Section 9
By October 1, 2025, the department and the department of children, youth, and families must jointly enter into a formal agreement that includes data sharing of information necessary to implement the provisions of this act.

## Section 10
This act may be known and cited as the child care workforce standards board act.
