<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds and declares the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>High quality child care and early learning enable parents to go to work, keeping the economy going at all levels and returning six dollars in value for every one dollar invested. High quality early learning services help prepare children for success in school and in life. A high quality child care and early learning system depends on a thriving, healthy, and competitively compensated workforce. Current conditions for child care workers have resulted in lack of access, unaffordable prices, and poorer outcomes for children and families;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Low compensation and poor working conditions impair the health, efficiency, and well-being of persons employed to provide child care, constitute unfair competition against other employers and their employees, threaten the stability of the child care market, create economic instability for providers, and result in a provider workforce that must rely in public and private assistance to support their own families;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fissured nature of child care workplaces exacerbates these conditions and create barriers preventing workers from being able to address these problems on their own; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Employment under these conditions threatens the health and well-being of the people of Washington and injures the overall economy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the declared policy of the state that such working conditions for child care workers be eliminated as rapidly as practicable through establishment of a workforce standards board comprised of employer and worker representatives and state agency representatives to set minimum compensation and other employment standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To ensure the state's policy goals are achieved, it is essential that child care workers are informed of their rights at work and under this act; are encouraged and able to freely participate in standard setting through the workforce standards board process; and are protected against any retaliation for such participation.</p>

<p>The board must adopt rules establishing minimum child care employment standards that are reasonably necessary and appropriate to protect the health and safety of child care workers, to ensure that child care workers are properly trained about and fully informed of their rights under this chapter, and to otherwise satisfy the purposes of this act. Standards established by the board must include, as appropriate, standards on compensation and other working conditions for child care workers. In establishing standards under this section, the board must establish statewide standards and may adopt standards that apply to specific child care occupations or geographic regions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board may not adopt standards regarding licensing of child care facilities. The board may not adopt standards that are less protective of or beneficial to child care workers as any other applicable statute or rule or any standard previously established by the board unless there is a determination by the board under subsection (2)(c) of this section.</p>

<p>To the extent that any minimum standards that the board finds are reasonably necessary and appropriate to protect the health and safety of child care workers fall within the jurisdiction of chapter 49.17 RCW, the board shall not adopt rules establishing the standards but shall instead recommend the occupational health and safety standards to the director. The director shall initiate rule making under chapter 49.17 RCW on child care health and safety standards as recommended by the board, unless the director determines that the recommended standard is outside the statutory authority of the department, is already covered under existing standards, presents enforceability challenges, is infeasible to implement, or is otherwise unlawful and issues a written explanation of this determination.</p>
