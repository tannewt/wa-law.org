<p>In addition to the student transportation allocation provided under RCW 28A.160.180, the superintendent of public instruction must allocate an amount to each school district equal to its student transportation allocation multiplied by 0.01166 to offset increased fuel costs due to the Washington climate commitment act. Allocations from this section must come from the climate commitment account established under RCW 70A.65.260 and are not part of the state's program of basic education.</p>
