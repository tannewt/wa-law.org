        i. Programs, activities, or projects that directly improve energy affordability and reduce the energy burden of people with lower incomes, as well as the higher transportation fuel burden of rural residents, such as bill assistance, energy efficiency, and weatherization programs;

        ii. Community renewable energy projects that allow qualifying participants to own or receive the benefits of those projects at reduced or no cost;

        iii. Programs, activities, or other worker-support projects for bargaining unit and nonsupervisory fossil fuel workers who are affected by the transition away from fossil fuels to a clean energy economy. Worker support may include, but is not limited to: (A) Full wage replacement, health benefits, and pension contributions for every worker within five years of retirement; (B) full wage replacement, health benefits, and pension contributions for every worker with at least one year of service for each year of service up to five years of service; (C) wage insurance for up to five years for workers reemployed who have more than five years of service; (D) up to two years of retraining costs, including tuition and related costs, based on in-state community and technical college costs; (E) peer counseling services during transition; (F) employment placement services, prioritizing employment in the clean energy sector; and (G) relocation expenses;

## Section 2
1. By September 1, 2026, and annually thereafter, the department of commerce, in consultation with the utilities and transportation commission, must calculate a school utilities impact percentage for each school district. The department of commerce must report the school utility impact percentage for each school district to the office of the superintendent of public instruction to calculate allocations under section 4 of this act.

2. For purposes of this section, "school utility impact percentage" means the impact of the cap and invest program created by the climate commitment act on utility costs for each school district, excluding costs otherwise mitigated by the allocation of no-cost allowances under this chapter, as a percentage increase above estimated utilities costs without the compliance activities required under the climate commitment act's cap and invest program.

## Section 3
In addition to the student transportation allocation provided under RCW 28A.160.180, the superintendent of public instruction must allocate an amount to each school district equal to its student transportation allocation multiplied by 0.01166 to offset increased fuel costs due to the Washington climate commitment act. Allocations from this section must come from the climate commitment account established under RCW 70A.65.260 and are not part of the state's program of basic education.

## Section 4
In addition to allocations provided under RCW 28A.150.260(8) for materials, supplies, and operating costs, the superintendent of public instruction must allocate to each school district an amount equal to half of the allocation for utilities and insurance under RCW 28A.150.260(8) multiplied by the district's school utility impact percentage provided under section 2 of this act. Allocations from this section must come from the climate commitment account established under RCW 70A.65.260 and are not part of the state's program of basic education.

## Section 5
Sections 3 and 4 of this act take effect September 1, 2026.
