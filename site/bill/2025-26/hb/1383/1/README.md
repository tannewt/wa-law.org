## Section 1

Grant funding must be used for the purchase of diapers, wipes, and other essential baby products for distribution to families in need.

2. Providers must apply for grant funding in a manner and on a timeline determined by the department.

3. The department must prioritize grants to providers serving or located in marginalized low-income communities or communities of color that are members of the national diaper bank network or equivalent successor organization, or, in communities where a national diaper bank network member does not exist, providers with sufficient storage, purchasing ability, and distribution capacity to manage the grant, and at least a two-year track record of distributing baby or other family essentials goods at scale.

4. By December 1, 2025, and on an annual basis thereafter, the department must publish a report on its website detailing grants awarded through the program.

5. The department may adopt rules to implement this section.
