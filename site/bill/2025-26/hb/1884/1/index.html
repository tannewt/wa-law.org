<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The regulated cannabis industry in Washington state has, year over year, demonstrated the highest rates of preventing youth access among all the regulated sectors. In addition, the regulated businesses have demonstrated a commitment to the highest standards of safety and contribution to the state by submitting to high testing standards and regulatory oversight. Further, the regulated industry faces extreme challenges in competing with the unregulated illicit market because of the high taxes, inconsistent enforcement and complicated regulatory burdens placed on the regulated market. The legislature intends to partner with those who choose to be regulated and taxed to prevent illegal, unsafe activities that threaten the promise of a new approach to cannabis. Washington has established precedent in creating regulatory certainty, consistency in and prioritization of enforcement activities within the department of labor and industries. The legislature has also previously adopted legislation describing its direction to the agency regarding upholding compliance while prioritizing issues that concern youth access and public safety. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature that the liquor and cannabis board establish policies and procedures to create more regulatory certainty and set priorities for enforcement activities to focus such activities on the violations that most impact public health and safety and the sustainability of the regulated market. Further, it is the intent of the legislature that the two highest priorities for enforcement shall be youth prevention and prevention of inversion and diversion of cannabis. Finally, it is the intent of the legislature that the board place less priority and effort in pursuing enforcement actions on businesses that do not have a direct impact on these priorities.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The board must prescribe procedures for the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The establishment, within existing resources, and through a collaborative public process including outreach to the regulated cannabis industry, of a hierarchy of enforcement priorities to guide the board's enforcement of this chapter and the board's rules implementing this chapter. The highest enforcement priority in the hierarchy must be placed on youth prevention and prevention of inversion and diversion of cannabis and cannabis products into and out of Washington's cannabis market. The hierarchy must place less emphasis on enforcement of administrative violations that are not the highest enforcement priority;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issuance of written warnings or notices to correct in lieu of penalties, sanctions, or other violations with respect to regulatory violations that have no direct or immediate relationship to public safety as defined by the board;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Waiving any fines, civil penalties, or administrative sanctions for violations, that have no direct or immediate relationship to public safety, and are corrected by the licensee within a reasonable amount of time as designated by the board;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A compliance program in accordance with chapter 43.05 RCW and RCW 69.50.342, whereby licensees may request compliance assistance and inspections without issuance of a penalty, sanction, or other violation provided that any noncompliant issues are resolved within a specified period of time; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The convening of a meeting of impacted parties, within existing resources, and no later than 20 business days before the effective date of any significant legislative rule, as defined in RCW 34.05.328, in order to: (i) Identify ambiguities and remaining areas of concern in the rule; (ii) coordinate education and public relations efforts by all parties; (iii) provide comments regarding internal board training and enforcement plans; and (iv) provide comments regarding appropriate evaluation mechanisms to determine the effectiveness of the new rule. The meeting must include a balanced representation of licensees impacted, board personnel, and other agencies or key stakeholder groups as determined by the board. An existing advisory committee may be used if appropriate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to subsection (1)(a) of this section, the board must adopt rules prescribing penalties for violations of this chapter. The board:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>May establish escalating penalties for violation of this chapter, provided that the cumulative effect of any such escalating penalties cannot last beyond two years and the escalation applies only to multiple violations that are the same or similar in nature;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May not include cancellation of a license for a single violation, unless the board can prove by a preponderance of the evidence:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Diversion of cannabis product to the illicit market or sales across state lines;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furnishing of cannabis product to minors;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diversion of revenue to criminal enterprises, gangs, cartels, or parties not qualified to hold a cannabis license based on criminal history requirements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission of noncannabis-related crimes; or</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowingly making a misrepresentation of fact to the board, an officer of the board, or an employee of the board related to conduct or an action that is, or alleged to be, any of the violations identified in (b)(i) through (iv) of this subsection (2);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May include cancellation of a license for cumulative violations only if a cannabis licensee commits at least four violations within a two-year period of time;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must consider aggravating and mitigating circumstances and deviate from the prescribed penalties accordingly, and must authorize enforcement officers to do the same, provided that such penalty may not exceed the maximum escalating penalty prescribed by the board for that violation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must give substantial consideration to mitigating any penalty imposed on a licensee when there is employee misconduct that led to the
violation and the licensee:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Established a compliance program designed to prevent the violation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performed meaningful training with employees designed to prevent the violation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Had not enabled or ignored the violation or other similar violations in the past.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board may not consider any violation that occurred more than two years prior as grounds for denial, suspension, revocation, cancellation, or nonrenewal, unless the board can prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the prior administrative violation evidences:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Diversion of cannabis product to the illicit market or sales across state lines;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furnishing of cannabis product to minors;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diversion of revenue to criminal enterprises, gangs, cartels, or parties not qualified to hold a cannabis license based on criminal history requirements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission of noncannabis-related crimes; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowingly making a misrepresentation of fact to the board, an officer of the board, or an employee of the board related to conduct or an action that is, or is alleged to be, any of the violations identified in (a) through (d) of this subsection (3).</p>

<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<p>The board, subject to the provisions of this chapter, must adopt rules that establish the procedures and criteria necessary to implement the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Licensing of cannabis producers, cannabis processors, and cannabis retailers, including prescribing forms and establishing application, reinstatement, and renewal fees.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Application forms for cannabis producers must request the applicant to state whether the applicant intends to produce cannabis for sale by cannabis retailers holding medical cannabis endorsements and the amount of or percentage of canopy the applicant intends to commit to growing plants determined by the department under RCW 69.50.375 to be of a THC concentration, CBD concentration, or THC to CBD ratio appropriate for cannabis concentrates, useable cannabis, or cannabis-infused products sold to qualifying patients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board must reconsider and increase limits on the amount of square feet permitted to be in production on July 24, 2015, and increase the percentage of production space for those cannabis producers who intend to grow plants for cannabis retailers holding medical cannabis endorsements if the cannabis producer designates the increased production space to plants determined by the department under RCW 69.50.375 to be of a THC concentration, CBD concentration, or THC to CBD ratio appropriate for cannabis concentrates, useable cannabis, or cannabis-infused products to be sold to qualifying patients. If current cannabis producers do not use all the increased production space, the board may reopen the license period for new cannabis producer license applicants but only to those cannabis producers who agree to grow plants for cannabis retailers holding medical cannabis endorsements. Priority in licensing must be given to cannabis producer license applicants who have an application pending on July 24, 2015, but who are not yet licensed and then to new cannabis producer license applicants. After January 1, 2017, any reconsideration of the limits on the amount of square feet permitted to be in production to meet the medical needs of qualifying patients must consider information contained in the medical cannabis authorization database established in RCW 69.51A.230;</p>
