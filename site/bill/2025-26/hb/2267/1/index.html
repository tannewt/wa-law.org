<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that tree canopy and green space are necessary for the health and wellness of Washingtonians, and that the presence of sufficient tree canopy provides numerous benefits, including mitigating the urban heat island effect, improving air and water quality, and assisting in stormwater management. The legislature finds that it is important to retain these functions in our communities. To improve the quality of tree canopy and green space in the state, the legislature previously adopted chapter 76.15 RCW to encourage planning for, planting, maintaining, and managing trees in the state's cities, counties, and tribal lands.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to expand on these efforts and to provide a framework for local governments to regulate and protect local tree canopy while, at the same time, allowing for sufficient development opportunities to satisfy housing needs. The legislature intends to encourage and assist local governments in the development and use of regulations to avoid and minimize impacts to tree canopy, and to provide adequate remediation measures if impacts are unavoidable.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that the department of commerce produce model regulations incorporating urban forestry protections and development incentives for the protection of tree canopy to assist local governments. It is also the intent of the legislature that these model regulations be voluntary and that local governments retain discretion in choosing whether to adopt the regulations.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The department of commerce, in consultation with other state agencies as necessary, shall produce a model urban forestry ordinance for use by local governments and provide guidance on addressing matters related to urban forestry. Additionally, the department of commerce shall provide technical assistance and planning support to local jurisdictions that decide to utilize the model ordinance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The options provided for in the model ordinance must, when applicable, first prioritize avoiding tree removal and tree canopy reduction, then minimizing impacts of tree removal, then mitigating any tree removal that has occurred. The model ordinance must include sections that:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>Provide options that can be used by local governments to incentivize developers to retain trees, but not limited to, incentives related to:</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) Increasing the allowed building density or height;</p>
<p>(B) Reducing minimum required lot sizes;</p>
<p>(C) Reducing or eliminating landscaping requirements;</p>
<p>(D) Reducing or eliminating required off-street parking requirements; and</p>
<p>(E) Reducing open space or setback requirements other than those necessary for shoreline management areas and critical areas;</p>
<pre><code>    ii. Provide regulatory options for avoiding or minimizing tree removal, harm to trees that are retained during and postdevelopment, or reduction in overall tree canopy;

    iii. Provide options and templates for incorporating the guidance provided under (c) of this subsection into local government ordinances; and

    iv. Provide options local governments can use to mitigate, both onsite and offsite of a development, the consequences of tree removal due to the development including, but not limited to, local replanting, the use of tree banks, and fee-in-lieu programs. The options provided for tree banks must:
</code></pre>
<p>(A) Establish criteria for designating areas for tree banks, including that tree banks must be located within the same specified geographic boundary that is impacted by the removal of the tree or trees. The criteria should prioritize, when possible, the designation of areas for tree banks that will provide increased tree canopy in areas suffering from adverse environmental factors including, but not limited to, erosion, flooding, air or water pollution, environmental health disparities, low tree canopy, or the urban heat island effect;</p>
<p>(B) Using best available science, determine, at a minimum:</p>
<p>(I) The appropriate ratios of trees that must be planted within a tree bank to mitigate for trees removed elsewhere within a community; and</p>
<p>(II) The native or regionally climate-adapted species of trees to be used within the tree bank in the different ecological regions in the state.</p>
<pre><code>c. The guidance provided by the department of commerce must include:

    i. Criteria for using best available science and community tree canopy goals to determine trees or groups of trees that, due to their size, location, or environmental impact should be retained during development;

    ii. Criteria for tree selection and siting for use by local jurisdictions in identifying native or regionally climate-adapted tree species for installation on private lots, in parks, open spaces, and within infrastructure such as public streets;

    iii. Best practices for establishing, maintaining, growing, nurturing, monitoring, replacing as necessary, and securing long-term protections for trees within a local government's jurisdiction, including by:
</code></pre>
<p>(A) Providing estimates of the cost to establish, maintain, and nurture newly planted trees to ensure their survival;</p>
<p>(B) Providing alternative options for covering those costs, including through the imposition of an appropriate fee or bond related to tree removal or canopy loss during development, to ensure that funds will be available to cover the costs of maintaining and nurturing the newly planted trees;</p>
<p>(C) Providing an estimate of the costs of, and best practices for, long-term maintenance and protection of established trees;</p>
<p>(D) Providing guidance on how to ensure conservation and protection of tree banks in perpetuity, such as through the use of land acquisition, conservation easements, or other binding legal conservation agreements; and</p>
<p>(E) Providing guidance on a system for tracking the use of tree banks, so as to ensure individual planted trees are not counted towards mitigation for multiple removed trees or multiple development sites, and to ensure accountability for the conservation and protection of the tree bank;</p>
<pre><code>    iv. Best practices for implementing a program for the planting of and care for trees, including through partnering with arboreal, conservation, or stewardship organizations;

v. Guidance on internal resource needs of the local government for planting and caring for trees within the local government's jurisdiction;

vi. Guidance on estimating the fiscal benefits of tree canopy retention within a jurisdiction including, but not limited to, benefits from stormwater mitigation, improving air quality, energy conservation, reducing the urban heat island effect, and improving quality of life due to the health cobenefits; and

vii. Guidance using the best available science on how jurisdictions can determine minimum tree canopy coverage goals, taking into account local geographic and climate differences.

d. The department of commerce must ensure that the model ordinance and guidance are consistent with municipal stormwater permit requirements.

<p>Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the department of commerce shall develop and administer a grant program to provide grants to cities and counties that adopt the model urban forestry ordinance produced by the department of commerce, for the purpose of adopting and implementing the elements of the ordinance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to be eligible for a grant, a county or city must have substantially adopted the model urban forestry ordinance, including utilization of the templates provided, implementation of regulatory options related to avoiding and minimizing impacts to mature trees and overall tree canopy, and implementation of options related to adopting mitigation measures, such as tree banks, when avoidance or minimization is infeasible. Additionally, a city or county with a population of more than 75,000 must adopt at least one of the model incentives for the retention of trees deemed by a jurisdiction to be significant, landmark, or otherwise of special import as provided for in the model ordinance in order to qualify for a grant under this section. The department of commerce may also award grants to a county or city that has adopted, prior to the effective date of this section, ordinances for urban forestry that the department of commerce determines, in its discretion, are substantially similar to the model ordinances produced by the department of commerce, for the purpose of implementing the county's or city's ordinances.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of commerce must produce the initial model ordinance and guidance by July 1, 2028. Thereafter, the department of commerce shall review and revise the model ordinance and guidance as necessary to ensure that the model ordinance and guidance represent effective and actionable means of protecting trees and preserving tree canopy while enabling needed urban development. The department of commerce shall conduct a review at least every 10 years.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Tree bank&quot; means an area or areas designated by a community wherein trees can be planted to compensate for the removal of trees elsewhere, in order to maintain overall tree canopy and create more ecologically sound systems. Tree banks may include public rights-of-way, public lands, and private property with the agreement of the landowners and a recorded covenant protecting the trees. Tree banks are intended to grow new trees or expand tree canopy where it does not currently exist. Existing trees within the area of a tree bank may not be included when determining whether the addition of trees to the tree bank has fully mitigated the removal of trees elsewhere. Tree banks may also include programs providing for the payment of a fee in lieu of physically planting the trees, to be used by the jurisdiction to plant trees in appropriate areas as determined by the criteria provided in accordance with subsection (1)(c)(i) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Urban heat island&quot; means an urban area which, due to the built environment and the lack of trees and other vegetation, experiences significantly high temperatures, particularly during the summer.</p>
