<p>Within 28 days after receiving a project permit application, a local government planning pursuant to RCW 36.70A.040 shall provide a written determination to the applicant.</p>

<p>The written determination must state either:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>That the application is procedurally complete; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the application is procedurally incomplete and that the procedural submission requirements of the local government have not been met. The determination shall outline what is necessary to make the application procedurally complete.</p>

<li>
<p>A project permit application is procedurally complete for purposes of this section when it meets the procedural submission requirements of the local government, as outlined on the project permit application. A determination of procedural completeness is not a substantive review of the application and shall not be conditioned on the adequacy, accuracy, or sufficiency of the information submitted. Additional information or studies may be required or project modifications may be undertaken subsequent to the procedural review of the application by the local government. The determination of completeness shall not preclude the local government from requesting additional information or studies either at the time of the notice of completeness or subsequently if new information is required or substantial changes in the proposed action occur. However, if the procedural submission requirements, as outlined on the project permit application have been provided, the need for additional information or studies may not preclude a completeness determination.</p>

<li>
<p>The determination of completeness may include or be combined with the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A preliminary determination of those development regulations that will be used for project mitigation;</p>

When the local government does not provide a written determination, they may still seek additional information or studies as provided for in subsection (2) of this section.</p>

<p>Development regulations adopted pursuant to RCW 36.70A.040 must establish and implement time periods for local government actions for each type of project permit application and provide timely and predictable procedures to determine whether a completed project permit application meets the requirements of those development regulations. Except for modifications by a jurisdiction provided for in (e) of this subsection, the time periods for local government actions for each type of complete project permit application or project type may not exceed those specified in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For project permits submitted after January 1, 2025, the development regulations must, for each type of permit application, specify the contents of a completed project permit application necessary for the complete compliance with the time periods and procedures.</p>

<p>A jurisdiction may exclude certain permit types and timelines for processing project permit applications as provided for in RCW 36.70B.140.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The time periods for local government action to issue a final decision for each type of complete project permit application or project type subject to this chapter should not exceed the following time periods unless modified by the local government pursuant to this section or RCW 36.70B.140:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>For project permits which do not require public notice under RCW 36.70B.110, a local government must issue a final decision within 65 days of the determination of completeness under RCW 36.70B.070;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For project permits which require public notice under RCW 36.70B.110, a local government must issue a final decision within 100 days of the determination of completeness under RCW 36.70B.070; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For project permits which require public notice under RCW 36.70B.110 and a public hearing, a local government must issue a final decision within 170 days of the determination of completeness under RCW 36.70B.070.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A jurisdiction may modify the provisions in (d) of this subsection to add permit types not identified, change the permit names or types in each category, address how consolidated review time periods may be different than permits submitted individually, and provide for how projects of a certain size or type may be differentiated, including by differentiating between permits that include a residential land use as a principal use of the land and permits that do not. Unless otherwise provided for the consolidated review of more than one permit, the time period for a final decision shall be the longest of the permit time periods identified in (d) of this subsection or as amended by a local government.</p>

<p>If a local government does not adopt an ordinance or resolution modifying the provisions in (d) of this subsection, the time periods in (d) of this subsection apply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of days an application is in review with the county or city shall be calculated from the day completeness is determined under RCW 36.70B.070 to the date a final decision is issued on the project permit application. The number of days shall be calculated by counting every calendar day and excluding the following time periods:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Any period between the day that the county or city has notified the applicant, in writing, that additional information is required to further process the application, an applicable fee must be paid, or a required notice must be posted, and the day when responsive information is resubmitted by the applicant, the fee is paid, or the notice is posted;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any period after an applicant informs the local government, in writing, that they would like to temporarily suspend review of the project permit application until the time that the applicant notifies the local government, in writing, that they would like to resume the application. A local government may set conditions for the temporary suspension of a permit application;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any period that the local government has completed all possible work on the application but must wait for necessary action by a government entity subject to subsection (2) or (3) of this section; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any period after an administrative appeal is filed until the administrative appeal is resolved and any additional time period provided by the administrative appeal has expired.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>The time periods for a local government to process a permit shall start over if an applicant proposes a change in use that adds or removes commercial or residential elements from the original application that would make the application fail to meet the determination of procedural completeness for the new use, as required by the local government under RCW 36.70B.070.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>If, at any time, an applicant informs the local government, in writing, that the applicant would like to temporarily suspend the review of the project for more than 60 days, or if an applicant is not responsive for more than 60 consecutive days after the county or city has notified the applicant, in writing, that additional information is required to further process the application, an additional 30 days may be added to the time periods for local government action to issue a final decision for each type of project permit that is subject to this chapter. Any written notice from the local government to the applicant that additional information is required to further process the application must include a notice that nonresponsiveness for 60 consecutive days may result in 30 days being added to the time for review. For the purposes of this subsection, &quot;nonresponsiveness&quot; means that an applicant is not making demonstrable progress on providing additional requested information to the local government, or that there is no ongoing communication from the applicant to the local government on the applicant's ability or willingness to provide the additional information.</li>
