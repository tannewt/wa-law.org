# HB 1665 - Capital gains tax repeal

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1665.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that the capital gains income tax incentivizes the out-of-state migration of individuals and families and is responsible for reducing Washington state's economic competitiveness relative to other states. To maintain Washington as a desirable place where individuals and families choose to reside, invest, and thrive, the legislature recognizes the need to repeal policies that discourage growth, innovation, and prosperity.

This tax has disproportionately affected economic activity and disadvantaged individuals and families who lack the means to avoid its impact. These dynamics exacerbate imbalances in the tax system and place additional burdens on those unable to navigate or mitigate the tax's effects. By repealing this tax, the legislature aims to create a fairer, more competitive economic environment that encourages the retention and attraction of diverse talent and investment.

Moreover, addressing this tax aligns with the state's commitment to fostering opportunity and ensuring that Washington remains an attractive destination for individuals, families, and businesses seeking to contribute to and benefit from its robust economy and quality of life.

## Section 2
## Section 3
This act takes effect October 1, 2025.
