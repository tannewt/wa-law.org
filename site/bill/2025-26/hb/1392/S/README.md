## Section 5
1. The medicaid access program account is created in the state treasury. All receipts from the assessments, interest, and penalties collected by the authority and commissioner under sections 3 and 4 of this act must be deposited into the account. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation.

    a. To make payments to health care providers and managed care organizations;

In such a case, the authority may require health care providers receiving excess payments to refund the payments in question to the account. The state in turn shall return funds to the federal government in the same proportion as the original financing. If a health care provider is unable to refund payments, the state shall develop either a payment plan, deduct moneys from future medicaid payments, or both; and
