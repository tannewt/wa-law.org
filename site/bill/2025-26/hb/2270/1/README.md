2. Before adopting an ordinance authorizing the alternative use of lodging tax revenues, the governing body of the municipality must:

    a. Provide notice in a legal newspaper of general circulation of the intent to adopt an ordinance;

    b. Hold a public hearing on the proposed use of funds. Notice of the public hearing must be published in a legal newspaper of general circulation within the city and posted in at least three conspicuous public places located in the city as well as on the city website. Notices must describe the intended use of funds; and

    c. Include opportunities for substantial input from business stakeholders and other members of the public.

## Section 2
Except as provided in RCW 67.28.180 and section 1 of this act, all revenue from taxes imposed under this chapter shall be credited to a special fund in the treasury of the municipality imposing such tax and used solely for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of tourism promotion, acquisition of tourism-related facilities, or operation of tourism-related facilities. Municipalities may, under chapter 39.34 RCW, agree to the utilization of revenue from taxes imposed under this chapter for the purposes of funding a multijurisdictional tourism-related facility.
