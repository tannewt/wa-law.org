[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1221.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature recognizes that the executive branch is well-equipped to confront emergencies and lead responses. However, for long-lasting states of emergency when the continuity of government has not been disrupted, the legislature finds that each of the branches of government has a role to play. Accordingly, this act is designed to ensure adequate legislative involvement in long-lasting states of emergency.

## Section 2
1. The proclamation of a state of emergency and other proclamations or orders issued by the governor pursuant to RCW 43.06.010, and 43.06.200 through 43.06.270 as now or hereafter amended shall be in writing and shall be signed by the governor and shall then be filed with the secretary of state. A proclamation of a state of emergency is effective upon the governor's signature. The governor shall give as much public notice as practical through the news media of the issuance of proclamations or orders pursuant to RCW 43.06.010, and 43.06.200 through 43.06.270 as now or hereafter amended.

2. The state of emergency shall cease to exist upon the earlier of:

    a. The issuance of a proclamation of the governor declaring its termination. The governor must terminate said state of emergency proclamation when order has been restored in the area affected;

    b. The passage of a concurrent resolution by the legislature declaring the termination of the state of emergency. If the legislature is not in session, the state of emergency may be terminated in writing by all of the four members of the leadership of the senate and the house of representatives; or

    c. Sixty days after a proclamation of a state of emergency is signed by the governor, unless extended by the legislature through concurrent resolution. If the legislature is not in session, the state of emergency may be extended in writing by all of the four members of the leadership of the senate and the house of representatives until the legislature can extend the state of emergency by concurrent resolution. The governor or legislature may also call a special session, consistent with the procedures outlined in the Constitution, to vote on a concurrent resolution to extend a state of emergency. No individual extension may exceed 60 days, but the legislature may pass subsequent resolutions of extension and the leadership of the senate and the house of representatives may issue subsequent extensions in writing in accordance with this subsection (2)(c).

3. Following the termination of a state of emergency under subsection (2) of this section, the governor may not declare a state of emergency on the same or a substantially similar topic. The legislature may reinstate a previously terminated state of emergency by concurrent resolution or, if the legislature is not in session, in writing by all of the four members of the leadership of the senate and the house of representatives.

4. For purposes of this section, "leadership of the senate and the house of representatives" means the majority leader of the largest caucus of the senate, minority leader of the second largest caucus of the senate, speaker of the house of representatives, and minority leader of the second largest caucus of the house of representatives.

## Section 3

Such other statutory and regulatory obligations or limitations prescribing the procedures for conduct of state business, or the orders, rules, or regulations of any state agency if strict compliance with the provision of any statute, order, rule, or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder, or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency, unless (i) authority to waive or suspend a specific statutory or regulatory obligation or limitation has been expressly granted to another statewide elected official, (ii) the waiver or suspension would conflict with federal requirements that are a prescribed condition to the allocation of federal funds to the state, or (iii) the waiver or suspension would conflict with the rights, under the First Amendment, of freedom of speech or of the people to peaceably assemble. The governor shall give as much notice as practical to legislative leadership and impacted local governments when issuing orders under this subsection (2)(g).

3. Any restrictions imposed by the governor as provided for by RCW 43.06.010 and 43.06.200 through 43.06.270are in effect for such times, upon such conditions, with such exceptions, and in such areas of this state that the governor from time to time deems necessary, except that:
