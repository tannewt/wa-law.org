<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the early childhood court program has federal funding through September 2027 and is currently not operating at capacity. Expanding access to early childhood courts ensures that these funds can be used to serve more families in the dependency system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that courts need clarification that they may use early childhood court funding to provide upstream supports, services, and resources to families at risk of entering the dependency system should they elect to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that there is a historical and ongoing impact of systemic racism within child welfare, especially as it affects Black, indigenous, and marginalized families. Recognizing the role of historical policies that devalue cultural and racial identities, this act aims to promote family integrity and dignity while supporting healthy outcomes through equitable and culturally sensitive practices.</p>

<ol>
<li>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A superior court may establish an early childhood court program to serve the needs of infants and toddlers who are under the age of six at the time the case enters the program and dependent pursuant to chapter 13.34 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An early childhood court program is a therapeutic court as defined in this chapter that provides an intensive court process for families with a child under age three who has been found dependent pursuant to chapter 13.34 RCW. To be eligible for the early childhood court program, a parent must have a child under age three that is dependent pursuant to chapter 13.34 RCW at the time the case enters the early childhood court program. The case may remain in the early childhood court program after the child is age three or older if the child is still dependent pursuant to chapter 13.34 RCW.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a superior court creates an early childhood court program, it shall incorporate the following core components into the program:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The court shall obtain a memorandum of understanding or other agreement with the department of children, youth, and families developed in collaboration with counsel for parents and children that outlines how the two entities will coordinate and collaborate to implement the core components overall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A community coordinator who may be employed by the courts, the county, or a nonprofit entity and who is a person with experience and training in diversity, equity, and inclusion measures and is dedicated to:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Facilitating real-time information sharing and collaboration among cross-sector professionals participating in the early childhood court program;</p>
</li>

The community team shall include diverse membership to include, but not be limited to, former parent participants, foster parents, parent and child advocates, an attorney for parents, a department of children, youth, and families caseworker, and a judicial officer. The community team aims to:</p>
<ol type="i">

</li>

</li>
<li>

<ol type="i">
<li>
