<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The crime firearm reward program is established to encourage persons to submit information to law enforcement to locate firearms that have been used in the commission of a crime. Any person who submits information to any peace officer, as defined in RCW 10.120.010, or to any agency with primary territorial jurisdiction, as defined in RCW 10.93.020, or to an entity that then forwards such information to a peace officer or such agency, that relates to the location of a firearm that has been used in the commission of a felony firearm offense is eligible to receive up to a $500 cash reward if that firearm is recovered. If the felony firearm offense related to the located firearm resulted in a criminal conviction, the person that submitted information relating to the location of the firearm is eligible to receive up to a $5,000 cash reward. A reward may not be paid to any law enforcement officer, any person that has an outstanding warrant, or to any federal, state, or local government or agency employee for information obtained by the individual in the normal course of their employment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cash rewards authorized by this section shall be in accordance with RCW 10.85.050 and paid by the city or county associated with the peace officer or agency with primary territorial jurisdiction that recovered the firearm. Cities and counties may pay the cash rewards authorized in this section from funds received from the county criminal justice assistance account created in RCW 82.14.310 and the municipal criminal justice assistance account created in RCW 82.14.320.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The county criminal justice assistance account is created in the state treasury. Beginning in fiscal year 2000, the state treasurer must transfer into the county criminal justice assistance account from the general fund the sum of $23,200,000 divided into four equal deposits occurring on July 1, October 1, January 1, and April 1. For each fiscal year thereafter, the state treasurer must increase the total transfer by the fiscal growth factor, as defined in RCW 43.135.025, forecast for that fiscal year by the office of financial management in November of the preceding year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The moneys deposited in the county criminal justice assistance account for distribution under this section, less any moneys appropriated for purposes under subsections (4) and (5) of this section, must be distributed at such times as distributions are made under RCW 82.44.150 and on the relative basis of each county's funding factor as determined under this subsection.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A county's funding factor is the sum of:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The population of the county, divided by 1,000, and multiplied by two-tenths;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The crime rate of the county, multiplied by three-tenths; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The annual number of criminal cases filed in the county superior court, for each 1,000 in population, multiplied by five-tenths.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under this section and RCW 82.14.320 and 82.14.330:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The population of the county or city is as last determined by the office of financial management;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The crime rate of the county or city is the annual occurrence of specified criminal offenses, as calculated in the most recent annual report on crime in Washington state as published by the Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs, for each 1,000 in population;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The annual number of criminal cases filed in the county superior court must be determined by the most recent annual report of the courts of Washington, as published by the administrative office of the courts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distributions and eligibility for distributions in the 1989-1991 biennium must be based on 1988 figures for both the crime rate as described under (b)(ii) of this subsection and the annual number of criminal cases that are filed as described under (b)(iii) of this subsection. Future distributions must be based on the most recent figures for both the crime rate as described under (b)(ii) of this subsection and the annual number of criminal cases that are filed as described under (b)(iii) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moneys distributed under this section must be expended exclusively for criminal justice purposes. Except after May 13, 2021, through December 31, 2023, these funds may not be used to replace or supplant existing funding. Criminal justice purposes are defined as activities that substantially assist the criminal justice system, which may include circumstances where ancillary benefit to the civil or juvenile justice system occurs, and which includes (a) domestic violence services such as those provided by domestic violence programs, community advocates, and legal advocates, as defined in RCW 70.123.020, and (b) payments made pursuant to section 1 of this act. Existing funding for purposes of this subsection is defined as calendar year 1989 actual operating expenditures for criminal justice purposes. Calendar year 1989 actual operating expenditures for criminal justice purposes exclude the following: Expenditures for extraordinary events not likely to reoccur, changes in contract provisions for criminal justice services, beyond the control of the local jurisdiction receiving the services, and major nonrecurring capital expenditures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not more than five percent of the funds deposited to the county criminal justice assistance account may be available for appropriations for enhancements to the state patrol crime laboratory system and the continuing costs related to these enhancements. Funds appropriated from this account for such enhancements may not supplant existing funds from the state general fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each fiscal biennium, the sum of $510,000, may be appropriated for the Washington state patrol to provide investigative assistance and report services to assist local law enforcement agencies to prosecute criminals.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The municipal criminal justice assistance account is created in the state treasury. Beginning in fiscal year 2000, the state treasurer must transfer into the municipal criminal justice assistance account for distribution under this section from the general fund the sum of $4,600,000 divided into four equal deposits occurring on July 1, October 1, January 1, and April 1. For each fiscal year thereafter, the state treasurer must increase the total transfer by the fiscal growth factor, as defined in RCW 43.135.025, forecast for that fiscal year by the office of financial management in November of the preceding year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No city may receive a distribution under this section from the municipal criminal justice assistance account unless:</p>

No city may receive more than 50 percent of any moneys distributed under this subsection (3)(a) but, if a city distribution is reduced as a result of exceeding the 50 percent limitation, the amount not distributed must be distributed under (b) of this subsection.</p>
</li>

Moneys must be distributed under this subsection (1)(a) ratably based on population as last determined by the office of financial management, but no city may receive more than one dollar per capita. Moneys remaining undistributed under this subsection at the end of each calendar year must be distributed to the criminal justice training commission to reimburse participating city law enforcement agencies with 10 or fewer full-time commissioned patrol officers the cost of temporary replacement of each officer who is enrolled in basic law enforcement training, as provided in RCW 43.101.200.</p>
