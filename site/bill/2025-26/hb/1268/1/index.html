<ol>
<li>
<p>A person may not engage in the business of money transmission, or advertise, solicit, or hold itself out as providing money transmission, unless the person is:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Licensed as a money transmitter under this chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An authorized delegate of a person licensed as a money transmitter under this chapter; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excluded under RCW 19.230.020.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A money transmitter license is not transferable or assignable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person who owns, operates, solicits, markets, advertises, or facilitates virtual currency transaction kiosks in this state is deemed to be engaged in the business of money transmission in this state and is subject to licensure under this chapter. A person operating a virtual currency transaction kiosk outside of a license is considered in violation of this chapter and subject to penalties as determined by the director.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not later than 15 days after the date a virtual currency licensee ceases to engage in the business of money transmission in this state for any reason, including a business decision to terminate operations in this state, license revocation, bankruptcy, or voluntary dissolution, such licensee must request surrender of the license for each location where such licensee has ceased to engage in such business. The licensee must also identify, in writing, to the director the location where the records of the licensee will be stored and the name, address, and telephone number of an individual authorized to provide access to the records. The surrender of a license does not reduce or eliminate the licensee's civil or criminal liability arising from actions undertaken by the director to revoke or suspend a license, assess a civil penalty, order restitution, or exercise any authority of the director.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Virtual currency licensees must provide to any person seeking to use the licensee's products or services the disclosures required by subsections (2) through (6) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As applicable, virtual currency licensees must make the following disclosures:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A schedule of all fees and charges the licensee may assess on a transaction, how the fees and charges will be calculated if not set in advance and disclosed, and the timing of the fees and charges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the product or service provided is insured or guaranteed by an agency of the United States, such as the federal deposit insurance corporation or the securities investor protection corporation or by private insurance against theft or loss, including cybertheft or theft by other means.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A notice that the transfer of virtual currency or digital units is irrevocable and any exception to the irrevocability of transfer.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Separate and in addition to the disclosures required under subsections (2), (4), and (5) of this section, before entering into a virtual currency transaction for, on behalf of, or with a person, a virtual currency transaction kiosk operator must disclose all material risks generally associated with virtual currency. The disclosure must be displayed on the screen of the virtual currency transaction kiosk with the ability for a person to acknowledge the receipt of the disclosures. The disclosures must include at least the following information:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Virtual currencies are not backed or insured by the government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to federal deposit insurance corporation, national credit union administration, securities investor protection, or corporation protections;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some virtual currency transactions are deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which may not be the date or time when the person initiates the transaction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The value of a virtual currency may be derived from market participants continued willingness to exchange fiat currency for virtual currency, which may result in the permanent and total loss of a particular virtual currency's value if the market for the virtual currency disappears;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no assurance that a person who accepts virtual currency as a payment today will do so in the future;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The volatility and unpredictability of the price of virtual currencies relative to fiat currency may result in a significant loss over a short period;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtual currency transactions are irreversible and may be used by scammers, including those impersonating loved ones, threatening jail time, stating that your identity is stolen, and insisting you withdraw money from your bank account and purchase cryptocurrency;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nature of virtual currency means that any technological difficulties experienced by the virtual currency transaction kiosk operator may prevent access to or use of a person's virtual currency; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any bond maintained by the licensee for the benefit of a person may not cover all losses the person incurs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before entering into a virtual currency transaction for, on behalf of, or with a person, a virtual currency transaction kiosk operator must provide an additional disclosure, which must be acknowledged by the person, written prominently and in bold type, and provided separately from the disclosures in subsections (2), (3), and (5) of this section, stating: &quot;WARNING: LOSSES DUE TO FRAUDULENT OR ACCIDENTAL TRANSACTION ARE NOT RECOVERABLE AND TRANSACTIONS IN DIGITAL FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE IRREVERSIBLE.&quot;</p>
