The licensee must also identify, in writing, to the director the location where the records of the licensee will be stored and the name, address, and telephone number of an individual authorized to provide access to the records. The surrender of a license does not reduce or eliminate the licensee's civil or criminal liability arising from actions undertaken by the director to revoke or suspend a license, assess a civil penalty, order restitution, or exercise any authority of the director.

## Section 2

    e. The volatility and unpredictability of the price of virtual currencies relative to fiat currency may result in a significant loss over a short period;
