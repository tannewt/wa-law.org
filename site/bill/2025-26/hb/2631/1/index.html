<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>On September 3, 2025, the governor issued Executive Order 25-06 establishing Your Washington within the office of the governor to replace the former Results Washington. Under the executive order, cabinet agencies are required to develop and track metrics focused on delivering exceptional customer service to Washingtonians and to communicate successes, failures, opportunities for improvement, and solutions related to the customer experience. Cabinet agencies are also required to designate a Your Washington liaison and comply with assessment and reporting requirements. It is the intent of the legislature to require, through a pilot project, certain noncabinet agencies that have wide-ranging missions and responsibilities, have direct and expansive public engagement, or are responsible for delivering tangible public goods, among other direct public impacts, to meet the same requirements as those described in Executive Order 25-06 to expand the state's effort to improve the customer experience for Washington residents regardless of whether the executive order remains in effect.</p>
