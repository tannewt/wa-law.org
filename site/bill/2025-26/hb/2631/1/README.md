[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2631.pdf)

## Section 1
On September 3, 2025, the governor issued Executive Order 25-06 establishing Your Washington within the office of the governor to replace the former Results Washington. Under the executive order, cabinet agencies are required to develop and track metrics focused on delivering exceptional customer service to Washingtonians and to communicate successes, failures, opportunities for improvement, and solutions related to the customer experience. Cabinet agencies are also required to designate a Your Washington liaison and comply with assessment and reporting requirements. It is the intent of the legislature to require, through a pilot project, certain noncabinet agencies that have wide-ranging missions and responsibilities, have direct and expansive public engagement, or are responsible for delivering tangible public goods, among other direct public impacts, to meet the same requirements as those described in Executive Order 25-06 to expand the state's effort to improve the customer experience for Washington residents regardless of whether the executive order remains in effect.

## Section 2
The office of the secretary of state, the department of fish and wildlife, and the office of the insurance commissioner, shall implement sections 3 through 6 of this act as a pilot project.

## Section 3
Covered agencies described in section 2 of this act shall:

1. In collaboration with Your Washington, established in Executive Order 25-06, develop and track metrics focused on delivering exceptional customer service and communicate successes, failures, opportunities for improvement, and solutions related to the customer experience;

2. By July 10, 2026, designate a Your Washington liaison with decision-making authority and accountability for:

## Section 5
1. By December 7, 2026, and in coordination with Your Washington created under Executive Order 25-06, covered agencies described in section 2 of this act shall develop and begin implementing a customer experience improvement plan, following a format mutually agreed upon with Your Washington, that includes:

    a. Metrics for measuring customer experience and customer satisfaction, and timelines for regularly tracking and reporting on the same;

    b. Staff training plans focused on delivering exceptional customer service and using plain language consistent with state guidelines; and

    c. A proposal, including its timeline for implementation, for improving the customer experience for key services provided by the agency such as reducing steps, shortening timelines, increasing digital self-service, and simplifying applications or making them more accessible.

2. Each covered agency shall incorporate the customer experience improvement plan developed under subsection (1) of this section into its strategic plan and prioritize agency efforts to improve its customer service in areas where its services are most critical to the public.

3. After initial plans are developed and implemented, covered agencies shall, in collaboration with Your Washington, update their customer experience improvement plan as part of their strategic planning process on an ongoing basis. Your Washington may recommend and encourage specific actions when it determines that an agency's progress requires improvement to meet customer needs.

4. Beginning March 7, 2027, and every three months thereafter until March 8, 2029, covered agencies shall provide a quarterly progress report to Your Washington, detailing the status of its implementation of their customer experience improvement plan.

Consistent with section 4(1)(a) of this act, Your Washington must work with covered agencies under section 2 of this act to ensure that metrics are disaggregated to the extent possible, and to the extent consistent with applicable law and the public policy of this state, to measure the experiences of different groups of people and to identify and eliminate bias and discrimination in the delivery of state programs and services.

## Section 9
This act expires April 1, 2029.
