<p>The registrations of deceased voters may be canceled from voter registration lists as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Periodically, the registrar of vital statistics of the state shall prepare a list of persons who resided in each county, for whom a death certificate was transmitted to the registrar and was not included on a previous list, and shall supply the list to the secretary of state.</li>
</ol>
<p>The secretary of state shall compare this list with the registration records and cancel the registrations of deceased voters.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>In addition, each county auditor may also use government agencies and newspaper obituary articles as a source of information for identifying deceased voters and canceling a registration. The auditor must verify the identity of the voter by matching the voter's date of birth or an address. The auditor shall record the date and source of the information in the cancellation records.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, any registered voter may sign a statement, subject to the penalties of perjury, to the effect that to his or her personal knowledge or belief another registered voter is deceased. This statement may be filed with the county auditor or the secretary of state. Only upon the receipt of such signed statement, and confirmation by the county auditor or the secretary of state , may the voter's registration be removed from the official state voter registration list.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The county auditor shall return an inactive voter to active voter status if, prior to the passage of two federal general elections, the voter:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Responds to a confirmation notice with information that he or she continues to reside at the registration address; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Votes or attempts to vote in a primary, special election, or general election.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the inactive voter fails to provide a notice or take an action as described in subsection (1) of this section, the auditor shall cancel the person's voter registration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county auditor must cancel an inactive voter registration when :</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The county auditor receives and confirms information under RCW 29A.08.510 that the voter has died;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county auditor receives information under RCW 29A.08.135 that the voter has registered to vote in another state; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county auditor receives a signed, written notification from the voter that the voter has moved out of the state or that the voter wishes to have their registration canceled. Prior to cancellation of such a registration the auditor shall verify that the signature on the notification matches the signature in the voter registration file.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The challenged voter resides at a different address than the residential address provided, and is not subject to RCW 29A.04.151 or 29A.08.112, in which case the challenger must :</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Provide the challenged voter's actual residence on the challenge form; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submit evidence that he or she exercised due diligence to verify that the challenged voter does not reside at the address provided. The challenger must, at minimum, provide evidence that the challenger personally</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Challenges must be filed with the county auditor of the county in which the challenged voter is registered no later than 45 days before the election. The county auditor or auditor's designee presides over the hearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Challenges may be filed after 45 days before the election, only when the challenged voter registered to vote less than 60 days before the election, or changed residence less than 60 days before the election without updating the residence address of the voter's voter registration. A challenge may then be filed not later than 10 days before any primary or election, general or special, or within 10 days of the voter being added to the voter registration database, whichever is later.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If the challenge is filed after 45 days before an election at which the challenged voter is eligible to vote, a notation of the challenge must be made immediately to the challenged voter's registration in the voter registration system, and the county canvassing board shall preside over the hearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the challenge is filed before the challenged voter's ballot is received, the ballot must be processed as a challenged ballot, and held until the challenge is resolved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the challenge is filed after the challenged voter's ballot is received, the challenge cannot affect the current election. However, the process shall proceed until the challenge is resolved.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The county auditor shall, within 10 business days of receipt, publish on the auditor's internet website the entire content of any voter challenge filed under this chapter . Immediately after publishing any voter challenge, the county auditor shall notify any person who requests to receive such notifications on an ongoing basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The information on the website may be removed 45 days following the completion or dismissal of the challenge. Information related to the challenge must be maintained by the county auditor for the appropriate retention period, and is subject to disclosure upon request.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="section-6">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the challenge is not in proper form or the factual basis for the challenge does not meet the legal grounds for a challenge, the county auditor must dismiss the challenge and notify the challenger of the reasons for the dismissal. A challenge is not in proper form if it is incomplete on its face or does not  comply with the form issued by the secretary of state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to notifying the voter of any challenge, the county auditor may conduct an initial review of the merits of the challenge. In that initial review of the merits, if the county auditor determines that it is more likely than not that the challenge lacks merit, then the county auditor may dismiss the challenge. The challenger may refile the challenge with additional evidence pursuant to the requirements of RCW 29A.08.810.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the challenge is in proper form and the factual basis meets the legal grounds for a challenge, the county auditor must notify the challenged voter and provide a copy of the affidavit. The county auditor shall also provide to any person, upon request, a copy of all materials provided to the challenged voter.</p>
<ol type="a">

</li>
<li>
<p>Notice of any consequences for failing to respond to the challenge; and</p>

<p>If the challenge is to the residential address provided by the voter, the challenged voter must be provided notice of the exceptions allowed in RCW 29A.08.112 and 29A.04.151, and Article VI, section 4 of the state Constitution, and may update the residence address on the voter's voter registration, or reregister until 8:00 p.m. the day of the election.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to (d) of this subsection, and only if after providing notice, eligibility cannot be confirmed and the challenge remains, the county auditor must schedule a hearing and notify the challenger and the challenged voter of the time and place for the hearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A hearing shall only be scheduled if the county auditor is unable to confirm the voter's eligibility and, based on the evidence submitted by the challenger, there is probable cause that the challenged voter is not qualified to vote. Challenges that do not meet the probable cause standard shall be dismissed without a hearing.</p>

The county auditor shall also notify the challenged voter by phone, including leaving a voicemail if possible, or email if the county auditor has such information in its records. If the county auditor receives no response from the challenged voter within 10 calendar days, the county auditor must provide the same such notice a second time. The secretary of state shall create a standard form for notification by mail and email. The challenger must appear in person at the hearing. The  challenged voter may either appear in person or submit testimony by affidavit. Personal appearance may be accomplished using video telecommunications technology if the auditor or canvassing board chooses.</p>

If the challenger fails to appear at the hearing, the challenge must be dismissed.

</li>
<li>
<p>If the voter does not provide their correct residence address, the voter shall be placed on inactive status. Any challenged ballot shall not be counted unless the voter provides their corrected residence address by the day before the certification of the election, in which case any races and ballot measures that the voter would have been qualified to vote for had the registration been correct shall be counted.</p>

<p>If the challenger fails to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the registration is improper, the challenge must be dismissed and any pending challenged ballot must be accepted as valid. All challenged ballots must be resolved before certification of the election.

<li>
<p>Any challenger that knowingly provides false information as part of a voter registration challenge under this chapter, either before or during an election, is guilty of false swearing under RCW 9A.72.040, with a fine in an amount fixed by the court of not more than $10,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any challenger that knowingly challenges a person's voter registration without reasonable cause under this chapter, either before or during an election, is guilty of a misdemeanor.
