<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that counseling, advising, and coaching that help students with the postsecondary financial aid application and enrollment processes, and that provide hands-on assistance, are evidence-based approaches to increasing rates of postsecondary enrollment. The legislature further recognizes that on-site experts deliver comprehensive school career counseling programs, which provide support for students and their families in securing postsecondary opportunities.</p>
<p>The addition of enrollment and outreach specialists can provide a valuable resource for comprehensive school career counseling programs and broaden access to student navigational supports throughout the state. Therefore, Washington state should invest in student navigational support and services to advise students to and through postsecondary education and training.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to establish a postsecondary outreach and enrollment specialist program for the purposes of helping Washington high school students with postsecondary financial aid and educational opportunities as well as encouraging completion of financial aid and postsecondary enrollment.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
