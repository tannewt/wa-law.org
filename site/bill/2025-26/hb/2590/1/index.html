<ol>
<li>
<p>The real property owned by a limited equity cooperative that provides owned housing for low-income households is exempt from property taxation if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The benefit of the exemption inures to the limited equity cooperative and its members;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least 85 percent of the occupied dwelling units in the limited equity cooperative is occupied by members of the limited equity cooperative determined as of January 1st of each assessment year for which the exemption is claimed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least 95 percent of the property for which the exemption is sought is used for dwelling units or other noncommercial uses available for use by the members of the limited equity cooperative; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The housing was insured, financed, or assisted, in whole or in part, through one or more of the following sources:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>A federal or state housing program administered by the department of commerce;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A federal or state housing program administered by the federal department of housing and urban development;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A federal housing program administered by a city or county government;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An affordable housing levy authorized under RCW 84.52.105;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The surcharges authorized by RCW 36.22.250 and any of the surcharges authorized in chapter 43.185C RCW; or</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="i" start="6">
<li>The Washington state housing finance commission.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If less than 100 percent of the dwelling units within the limited equity cooperative is occupied by low-income households, the limited equity cooperative is eligible for a partial exemption on the real property. The amount of exemption must be calculated by multiplying the assessed value of the property owned by the limited equity cooperative by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the number of dwelling units occupied by low-income households as of January 1st of each assessment year for which the exemption is claimed, and the denominator of the fraction is the total number of dwelling units as of such date.</p>

<li>
<p>The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</p>
