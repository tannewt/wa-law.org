<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that free and fair elections are the cornerstone of American democracy, and the corresponding right to vote is among the most fundamental privileges of American citizenship. Holding steadfast to these principles, the state of Washington has a long history of protecting Washingtonians' right to vote in elections, easing barriers to participation, combating attempts to suppress turnout, and promoting civic engagement. As a result, Washington routinely ranks among the highest states in the nation in voter participation, and it has some of the most accessible voting policies in the nation.</p>
<p>The legislature believes that celebrating election day serves as an important reminder of the crucial role of elections in our society. Further, the legislature believes that celebrating election day encourages participation in the democratic process and instills civic values in Washingtonians. Therefore, to increase awareness and participation in elections, and to commemorate this foundational American institution, the legislature intends to recognize the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November as &quot;election day.&quot;</p>

<li>
<p>Employees of the state and its political subdivisions, including employees of school districts and those nonclassified employees of institutions of higher education who hold appointments or are employed under contracts to perform services for periods of less than twelve consecutive months, are entitled to two unpaid holidays per calendar year for a reason of faith or conscience or an organized activity conducted under the auspices of a religious denomination, church, or religious organization. This includes employees of public institutions of higher education, including community colleges, technical colleges, and workforce training programs. The employee may select the days on which the employee desires to take the two unpaid holidays after consultation with the employer pursuant to guidelines to be promulgated by rule of the appropriate personnel authority, or in the case of local government by ordinance or resolution of the legislative authority. If an employee prefers to take the two unpaid holidays on specific days for a reason of faith or conscience, or an organized activity conducted under the auspices of a religious denomination, church, or religious organization, the employer must allow the employee to do so unless the employee's absence would impose an undue hardship on the employer or the employee is necessary to maintain public safety. Undue hardship shall have the meaning established in rule by the office of financial management under RCW 43.41.109.</p>
