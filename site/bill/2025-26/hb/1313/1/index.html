<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Research shows mass layoffs can have a detrimental effect on both employees and employers. Detrimental effects can include loss of knowledge and institutional memory, low morale and a decline in job satisfaction for the remaining employees, weakened engagement, higher voluntary turnover, and lower innovation for the business. The legislature recognizes that workers are often very dependent on their employers for their livelihood and well-being. The legislature seeks to encourage employers to provide adequate notice and protections to workers. The legislature also intends to encourage more transparency in the employer's process of conducting mass layoffs, which can help reduce these detrimental effects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also seeks to determine whether mass layoffs result in a disproportionate dismissal of employees belonging to protected classes and whether certain groups of employees are laid off more than other groups. The legislature also seeks to reduce the impact that mass layoffs have on terminated employees by increasing the ways those employees receive information about benefits and programs they may be entitled to or eligible for.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>As of the time that notice would have been required, the employer was actively seeking capital or business;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The employer reasonably and in good faith believed that giving the notices required by section 3 of this act would have precluded the employer from obtaining the needed capital or business.</p>

<p>An employer must provide a rapid response partner reasonable access to employees who receive a notice as required under section 3 of this act.

<p>A provision in an agreement by an employer and an employee not to disclose or discuss conduct, or the existence of a settlement involving conduct, that the employee reasonably believed under Washington state, federal, or common law to be illegal discrimination, illegal harassment, illegal retaliation, a wage and hour violation, or sexual assault, or that is recognized as against a clear mandate of public policy, is void and unenforceable. Prohibited nondisclosure and nondisparagement provisions in agreements concern conduct that occurs at the workplace, at work-related events coordinated by or through the employer, between employees, or between an employer and an employee, whether on or off the employment premises. Prohibited nondisclosure and nondisparagement provisions include those contained in employment agreements, independent contractor agreements, agreements to pay compensation in exchange for the release of a legal claim, or any other agreement between an employer and an employee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to (a) of this subsection, a provision in an agreement by an employer and an employee is void and unenforceable if the provision prohibits the employee from disclosing or discussing the employer's conduct regarding a mass layoff as a condition of the employee receiving severance pay or compensation under section 5 of this act. It is a violation of this section for an employer to discriminate against or otherwise retaliate against an employee for disclosing or discussing conduct regarding a mass layoff that the employee is not prohibited from discussing or disclosing under this subsection. For purposes of this subsection, &quot;mass layoff&quot; has the same meaning as defined in section 2 of this act. This subsection (1)(b) applies to agreements entered into on or after the effective date of this section.</p>

<p>This section does not prohibit the enforcement of a provision in any agreement that prohibits the disclosure of the amount paid in settlement of a claim.</p>

<li>
<p>It is a violation of this section for an employer to discharge or otherwise discriminate or retaliate against an employee for disclosing or discussing conduct that the employee reasonably believed to be illegal harassment, illegal discrimination, illegal retaliation, wage and hour violations, or sexual assault, that is recognized as illegal under state, federal, or common law, or that is recognized as against a clear mandate of public policy, occurring in the workplace, at work-related events coordinated by or through the employer, between employees, or between an employer and an employee, whether on or off the employment premises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a violation of this section for an employer to request or require that an employee enter into any agreement provision that is prohibited by this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a violation of this section for an employer to attempt to enforce a provision of an agreement prohibited by this section, whether through a lawsuit, a threat to enforce, or any other attempt to influence a party to comply with a provision in any agreement that is prohibited by this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not prohibit an employer and an employee from protecting trade secrets, proprietary information, or confidential information that does not involve illegal acts.</p>

<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;employee&quot; means a current, former, or prospective employee or independent contractor.</p>

<p>A nondisclosure or nondisparagement provision in any agreement signed by an employee who is a Washington resident is governed by Washington law.</p>

<li>
<p>The provisions of this section are to be liberally construed to fulfill its remedial purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As an exercise of the state's police powers and for remedial purposes, this section is retroactive from June 9, 2022, only to invalidate nondisclosure or nondisparagement provisions in agreements created before June 9, 2022, and which were agreed to at the outset of employment or during the course of employment. This subsection allows the recovery of damages only to prevent the enforcement of those provisions. This subsection does not apply to a nondisclosure or nondisparagement provision contained in an agreement to settle a legal claim.</p>

<p>Unless the employer discloses the terms of the covenant in writing to the prospective employee no later than the time of the initial oral or written acceptance of the offer of employment and, if the agreement becomes enforceable only at a later date due to changes in the employee's compensation, the employer specifically discloses that the agreement may be enforceable against the employee in the future; or</p>

<p>A court or arbitrator must presume that any noncompetition covenant with a duration exceeding eighteen months after termination of employment is unreasonable and unenforceable.
