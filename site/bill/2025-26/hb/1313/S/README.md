# HB 1313 - Mass layoffs

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1313-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. Research shows mass layoffs can have a detrimental effect on both employees and employers. Detrimental effects can include loss of knowledge and institutional memory, low morale and a decline in job satisfaction for the remaining employees, weakened engagement, higher voluntary turnover, and lower innovation for the business. The legislature recognizes that workers are often very dependent on their employers for their livelihood and well-being. The legislature seeks to encourage employers to provide adequate notice and protections to workers. The legislature also intends to encourage more transparency in the employer's process of conducting mass layoffs, which can help reduce these detrimental effects.

2. The legislature also seeks to determine whether mass layoffs result in a disproportionate dismissal of employees belonging to protected classes and whether certain groups of employees are laid off more than other groups. The legislature also seeks to reduce the impact that mass layoffs have on terminated employees by increasing the ways those employees receive information about benefits and programs they may be entitled to or eligible for.

    b. The capital or business sought, if obtained, would have enabled the employer to avoid or postpone the mass layoff, relocation, or termination; and

2. The department may investigate alleged violations of this section and may, upon a finding that an employer has violated this section, issue a notice of violation and order a payment to the employee equal to the value of the cost of any benefits to which the employee would have been entitled, including the cost of any medical expenses incurred by the employee that would have been covered under an employee benefit plan. However, the department may not investigate an alleged violation occurring more than three years prior.

## Section 17
1. [Empty]

    a. A provision in an agreement by an employer and an employee not to disclose or discuss conduct, or the existence of a settlement involving conduct, that the employee reasonably believed under Washington state, federal, or common law to be illegal discrimination, illegal harassment, illegal retaliation, a wage and hour violation, or sexual assault, or that is recognized as against a clear mandate of public policy, is void and unenforceable. Prohibited nondisclosure and nondisparagement provisions in agreements concern conduct that occurs at the workplace, at work-related events coordinated by or through the employer, between employees, or between an employer and an employee, whether on or off the employment premises. Prohibited nondisclosure and nondisparagement provisions include those contained in employment agreements, independent contractor agreements, agreements to pay compensation in exchange for the release of a legal claim, or any other agreement between an employer and an employee.

    b. In addition to (a) of this subsection, a provision in an agreement by an employer and an employee is void and unenforceable if the provision prohibits the employee from disclosing or discussing the employer's conduct regarding a mass layoff as a condition of the employee receiving severance pay or compensation under section 5 of this act. It is a violation of this section for an employer to discriminate against or otherwise retaliate against an employee for disclosing or discussing conduct regarding a mass layoff that the employee is not prohibited from discussing or disclosing under this subsection. For purposes of this subsection, "mass layoff" has the same meaning as defined in section 2 of this act. This subsection (1)(b) applies to agreements entered into on or after the effective date of this section.

2. This section does not prohibit the enforcement of a provision in any agreement that prohibits the disclosure of the amount paid in settlement of a claim.

3. It is a violation of this section for an employer to discharge or otherwise discriminate or retaliate against an employee for disclosing or discussing conduct that the employee reasonably believed to be illegal harassment, illegal discrimination, illegal retaliation, wage and hour violations, or sexual assault, that is recognized as illegal under state, federal, or common law, or that is recognized as against a clear mandate of public policy, occurring in the workplace, at work-related events coordinated by or through the employer, between employees, or between an employer and an employee, whether on or off the employment premises.

4. It is a violation of this section for an employer to request or require that an employee enter into any agreement provision that is prohibited by this section.

5. It is a violation of this section for an employer to attempt to enforce a provision of an agreement prohibited by this section, whether through a lawsuit, a threat to enforce, or any other attempt to influence a party to comply with a provision in any agreement that is prohibited by this section.

6. This section does not prohibit an employer and an employee from protecting trade secrets, proprietary information, or confidential information that does not involve illegal acts.

7. An employer who violates this section after June 9, 2022, is liable in a civil cause of action for actual or statutory damages of $10,000, whichever is more, as well as reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.

8. For the purposes of this section, "employee" means a current, former, or prospective employee or independent contractor.

9. A nondisclosure or nondisparagement provision in any agreement signed by an employee who is a Washington resident is governed by Washington law.

10. The provisions of this section are to be liberally construed to fulfill its remedial purpose.

11. As an exercise of the state's police powers and for remedial purposes, this section is retroactive from June 9, 2022, only to invalidate nondisclosure or nondisparagement provisions in agreements created before June 9, 2022, and which were agreed to at the outset of employment or during the course of employment. This subsection allows the recovery of damages only to prevent the enforcement of those provisions. This subsection does not apply to a nondisclosure or nondisparagement provision contained in an agreement to settle a legal claim.

## Section 18
1. A noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable:

    a. [Empty]

        i. Unless the employer discloses the terms of the covenant in writing to the prospective employee no later than the time of the initial oral or written acceptance of the offer of employment and, if the agreement becomes enforceable only at a later date due to changes in the employee's compensation, the employer specifically discloses that the agreement may be enforceable against the employee in the future; or

        ii. If the covenant is entered into after the commencement of employment, unless the employer provides independent consideration for the covenant;

    b. Unless the employee's earnings from the party seeking enforcement, when annualized, exceed one hundred thousand dollars per year. This dollar amount must be adjusted annually in accordance with RCW 49.62.040;

    c. If the employee is terminated as the result of a layoff, unless enforcement of the noncompetition covenant includes compensation equivalent to the employee's base salary at the time of termination for the period of enforcement minus compensation earned through subsequent employment during the period of enforcement;

    d. If the employee is terminated as the result of a mass layoff, as defined in section 2 of this act, and the employer failed to comply with the notice requirement in section 3 of this act.

2. A court or arbitrator must presume that any noncompetition covenant with a duration exceeding eighteen months after termination of employment is unreasonable and unenforceable. A party seeking enforcement may rebut the presumption by proving by clear and convincing evidence that a duration longer than eighteen months is necessary to protect the party's business or goodwill.

## Section 19
If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.

## Section 20
This act takes effect July 1, 2026.
