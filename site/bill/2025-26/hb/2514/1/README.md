# HB 2514 - War on terror memorial

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2514.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature intends to remember Washington service members who died in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation New Dawn, which are classified under the umbrella term global war on terror.

Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, many Washington residents answered the call to serve their country in the global war on terror. They chose duty and sacrifice, serving in the nation's all-volunteer military to prevent such a devastating attack on America from happening again.

Operation Enduring Freedom began on October 7, 2001, when the United States initiated military operations in Afghanistan. Combat operations there concluded on December 31, 2014.

Operation Iraqi Freedom began on March 20, 2003. Although President Bush declared an end to major combat operations on May 1, 2003, prolonged insurgency and sectarian violence persisted. United States forces continued peacekeeping efforts and supported the new Iraqi government under Operation New Dawn until their withdrawal on December 15, 2011.

Although military operations in the global war on terror ended in 2014, there is no memorial on the state capitol campus to specifically honor Washington residents who died in these operations.

The legislature intends to establish a dedicated memorial on the global war on terror. This memorial will continue Washington's tradition of recognizing residents who made the ultimate sacrifice to defend the homeland and promote peace worldwide.

## Section 2
1. The global war on terror memorial is established on the capitol campus to commemorate the global war on terror to recognize service members who died in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation New Dawn, which are classified under the umbrella term global war on terror. The memorial must include a component designed to reflect on the great number of active duty service members and veterans who have died by suicide after serving in these wars. The design of the memorial must serve to honor those who are lost and provide a sacred space for healing and reflection for veterans and military families.
