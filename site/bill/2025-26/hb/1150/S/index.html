<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that, as of 2025:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Washington's statewide waste recovery rate has been generally static since 2011 and Washington is not meeting the statewide goal of 50 percent recycling established in 1989; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many residents, particularly those who live in rural areas and in multifamily residences, do not have access to convenient or affordable curbside recycling, and must rely on taking recyclables to drop box locations, and that extended producer responsibility programs could make curbside recycling available and affordable for most people in the state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to require extended producer responsibility programs for consumer packaging and paper products to be implemented in a manner that involves producers in material management from design concept to end of life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is intended that these programs be responsibly planned and funded in a manner that minimizes negative impacts to the environment and minimizes risks to public health and worker health and safety. It is also intended that these programs build and expand on the existing waste and recycling system's infrastructure and reliance on the authority of local governments and the utilities and transportation commission in solid waste management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, it is the intent of the legislature that Washington should maintain the successful public-private partnership between state, local government, and solid waste and recycling service providers. The legislature does not intend to diminish or displace the primary role of the utilities and transportation commission and local governments in regulating or contracting directly with service providers for the curbside collection of residential recyclables. Local governments maintain their existing authority to collect, contract for collection with solid waste and recycling service providers, or defer to solid waste collection services regulated by the utilities and transportation commission.</p>

<p>For purposes of determining whether plastic source reduction performance targets are being met, a plan must provide a methodology for measuring the amount of plastic source reduction of covered materials in a manner that can be used to determine the extent to which the amount of material used for a covered material can be reduced to what is necessary to efficiently deliver a product without damage or spoilage, or other means of covered material redesign to reduce overall use and environmental impacts and maintain recyclability, compostability, or reusability. No more than eight percent of a producer responsibility organization's plastic source reduction performance target may be met by switching from virgin covered material to postconsumer recycled content through a sliding scale alternative compliance formula developed by the department based on the ratio of virgin plastic to postconsumer recycled plastic. For producers subject to the postconsumer recycled content requirements of chapter 70A.245 RCW, the postconsumer recycled content used to comply with those requirements may be credited towards the plastic source reduction performance target, subject to the eight percent limit.</p>

Such criteria shall include: Anticipated recovery rates and levels of public participation, availability of environmentally sound disposal capacity, access to markets for recyclable materials, unreasonable cost impacts on the ratepayer over the six-year planning period, utilization of environmentally sound waste reduction and recycling technologies, and other factors as appropriate. In rural areas, these programs shall include but not be limited to drop-off boxes, buy-back centers, or a combination of both, at each solid waste transfer, processing, or disposal site, or at locations convenient to the residents of the county.

<p>(I) Provide curbside collection of source separated recyclable materials from single-family and multiple-family residences wherever curbside garbage collection services are provided to these entities;</p>

<p>(III) Include service standards for curbside collection frequency, container size, and method of collection, established under plans approved by the department under chapter 70A.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 401 of this act);</p>
<p>(C) A county may, by ordinance, direct that the full list of materials on the statewide collection list identified as suitable for residential collection be collected exclusively through drop-off locations in areas regulated by the utilities and transportation commission under the provisions of chapter 81.77 RCW if the areas were designated as rural in the county solid waste management plan and no curbside recycling collection service was offered within those areas as of January 1, 2025. Where a county has adopted such an ordinance, the provisions of (b)(i)(B) of this subsection do not apply;</p>
<p>(D) Comprehensive solid waste management plans may incorporate by reference programs described in an approved producer responsibility organization plan under chapter 70A.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 401 of this act) to fulfill the requirements of this subsection (7)(b)(i) in whole or in part;</p>
