<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that private security guards are required to pay an initial licensing fee of $101 and an annual license renewal fee of $95. These recurring out-of-pocket costs create a significant barrier for workers entering and remaining in the security guard profession, particularly in an industry characterized by modest wages, irregular hours, and high turnover.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that private security guards frequently serve as frontline responders, working in challenging and high-risk environments to protect people, property, and public safety. Ensuring that qualified individuals are not excluded from this profession due to licensing costs strengthens workforce stability and improves public safety outcomes across Washington.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that the private security industry is dominated by large, well-capitalized corporations with substantial revenues and extensive workforces. Six of the major employers in the industry have a workforce of thousands of employees and each report annual revenues of over $1,000,000,000, with the two largest reporting revenues of $15,000,000,000 and $20,000,000,000. These employers are far better positioned than individual security guards to absorb the cost of licensing and renewal fees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature concludes that requiring security guards to shoulder these licensing costs places a disproportionate burden on frontline security guards while providing a financial benefit to large corporate employers. Therefore, the legislature intends to rebalance responsibility within the industry by promoting fairness, improving worker retention, and supporting a stable and professional private security guard workforce that serves the public interest by shifting the cost of the licensing fees to the employer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
