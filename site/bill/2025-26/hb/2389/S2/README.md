# HB 2389 - Criminal offenses under 18

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2389-S2.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that despite significant reductions in youth crime in the past 15 years, racial disparities continue to persist, with Black, Latino, and indigenous youth overrepresented in juvenile court filings, adjudications, and admissions to state juvenile prison.

2. The legislature further finds that Washington remains the only state in the country with a presumptive sentencing grid for all youth offenders. Most other states either consider individualized factors, or use a sentencing grid based on risk levels or for certain offenses.

3. The legislature further finds that Washington's juvenile sentencing grid was established in 1978, and has rarely been changed, despite significant advances in our understanding of youth development, brain science, and effective alternatives to secure incarceration.

4. The legislature further finds that black youth are 27 times more likely than white youth to be charged with a robbery offense, offenses which require lengthy sentences even for first-time offenders. The legislature further finds that youth adjudicated of robbery offenses make up approximately one-third of the current population incarcerated in a juvenile rehabilitation institution, exacerbating both overcrowding and racial and ethnic disparities in Washington's youth prisons. Moreover, research regarding length of incarceration shows that stays longer than six months do not reduce recidivism and that longer lengths of stay increase the mental health and health disparities for system-involved youth including trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder.

5. Therefore, the legislature intends to strengthen local decision making, provide more equitable access to sentencing alternatives, and provide opportunities for youth who have demonstrated significant rehabilitation to move to less-restrictive placement options.

## Section 2
1. The standard range disposition for a juvenile adjudicated of an offense is determined according to RCW 13.40.0357 and this section.

    a. When the court sentences an offender to a local sanction as provided in RCW 13.40.0357 option A, the court shall impose a determinate disposition within the standard ranges, except as provided in subsections (2)through (5) of this section. The disposition may be comprised of one or more local sanctions.

    b. When the court sentences an offender to a standard range as provided in RCW 13.40.0357 option A that includes a term of confinement exceeding 30 days, commitment shall be to the department for the standard range of confinement, except as provided in subsections (2)through (5) of this section.

    c. Unless the offense is excluded under (d) of this subsection, the court must maintain concurrent jurisdiction with the department over a juvenile committed to the department, except the court's concurrent jurisdiction may be only for the purposes of conducting the review hearings described under RCW 13.40.185(3), and any community supervision that is ordered if a juvenile is released at the review hearing.

    d. Concurrent jurisdiction described in (c) of this subsection is not required for the following:

        i. A serious violent offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030;

        ii. A violent offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030 and the juvenile has a criminal history consisting of: One or more prior serious violent offenses; two or more prior violent offenses; or three or more of any combination of the following offenses: Any class A felony, any class B felony, vehicular assault, or manslaughter in the second degree, all of which must have been committed after the juvenile's 13th birthday and prosecuted separately;

        iii. A sex offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030;

        iv. Manslaughter in the second degree under RCW 9A.32.070;

    v. Hit and run resulting in death under RCW 46.52.020(4)(a);

    vi. Assault of a child in the second degree under RCW 9A.36.130; and

    vii. Vehicular homicide under RCW 46.61.520.

2. If the court concludes, and enters reasons for its conclusion, that disposition within the standard range would effectuate a manifest injustice the court shall impose a disposition outside the standard range, as indicated in option D of RCW 13.40.0357. The court's finding of manifest injustice shall be supported by clear and convincing evidence.

A disposition outside the standard range shall be determinate, subject to RCW 13.40.185(3), and shall be comprised of confinement or community supervision, or a combination thereof. When a judge finds a manifest injustice and imposes a sentence of confinement exceeding thirty days, the court shall sentence the juvenile to a maximum term, and the provisions of RCW 13.40.030(2) shall be used to determine the range. A disposition outside the standard range is appealable under RCW 13.40.230 by the state or the respondent. A disposition with a term of confinement that is 30 days or more is  appealable under RCW 13.40.230 unless the disposition relates to an offense in subsection (1)(d) of this section.

3. If a juvenile offender is found to have committed a sex offense, other than a sex offense that is also a serious violent offense as defined by RCW 9.94A.030, and has no history of a prior sex offense, the court may impose the special sex offender disposition alternative under RCW 13.40.162.

4. The court may impose the disposition alternative under RCW 13.40.165 unless a juvenile has been adjudicated of an offense described in subsection (1)(d) of this section.

5.

RCW 13.40.193 shall govern the disposition of any juvenile adjudicated of possessing a firearm in violation of RCW 9.41.040(2)(a)(v) or any crime in which a special finding is entered that the juvenile was armed with a firearm.

6. RCW 13.40.308 shall govern the disposition of any juvenile adjudicated of theft of a motor vehicle as defined under RCW 9A.56.065, possession of a stolen motor vehicle as defined under RCW 9A.56.068, taking a motor vehicle without permission in the first degree under RCW 9A.56.070, and taking a motor vehicle without permission in the second degree under RCW 9A.56.075.

7. Whenever a juvenile offender is entitled to credit for time spent in detention prior to a dispositional order, the dispositional order shall specifically state the number of days of credit for time served.

8. Except as provided under subsections (3)through (5) of this section, or option B of RCW 13.40.0357, or RCW 13.40.127, the court shall not suspend or defer the imposition or the execution of the disposition.

9. In no case shall the term of confinement imposed by the court at disposition exceed that to which an adult could be subjected for the same offense.

## Section 3
1. The purpose of this disposition alternative is to ensure that successful treatment options to reduce recidivism are available to eligible youth, pursuant to RCW 71.24.615. It is also the purpose of the disposition alternative to assure that minors in need of substance use disorder, mental health, and/or co-occurring disorder treatment receive an appropriate continuum of culturally relevant care and treatment, including prevention and early intervention, self-directed care, parent-directed care, and residential treatment. To facilitate the continuum of care and treatment to minors in out-of-home placements, all divisions of the department that provide these services to minors shall jointly plan and deliver these services. It is also the purpose of the disposition alternative to protect the rights of minors against needless hospitalization and deprivations of liberty and to enable treatment decisions to be made in response to clinical needs and in accordance with sound professional judgment. The mental health, substance abuse, and co-occurring disorder treatment providers shall, to the extent possible, offer services that involve minors' parents, guardians, and family.

2. The court must consider eligibility for the substance use disorder or mental health disposition alternative when a juvenile offender is subject to a standard range disposition  and has not committed an offense under RCW 13.40.160(1)(d). The court, on its own motion or the motion of the state or the respondent if the evidence shows that the offender may be chemically dependent, substance abusing, or has significant mental health or co-occurring disorders may order an examination by a substance use disorder counselor from a substance use disorder treatment facility approved under chapter 70.96A RCW or a mental health professional as defined in chapter 71.34 RCW to determine if the youth is chemically dependent, substance abusing, or suffers from significant mental health or co-occurring disorders. The state shall pay the cost of any examination ordered under this subsection unless third-party insurance coverage is available.

3. The report of the examination shall include at a minimum the following: The respondent's version of the facts and the official version of the facts, the respondent's offense history, an assessment of drug-alcohol problems, mental health diagnoses, previous treatment attempts, the respondent's social, educational, and employment situation, and other evaluation measures used. The report shall set forth the sources of the examiner's information.

4. The examiner shall assess and report regarding the respondent's relative risk to the community. A proposed treatment plan shall be provided and shall include, at a minimum:

    a. Whether inpatient and/or outpatient treatment is recommended;

    b. Availability of appropriate treatment;

    c. Monitoring plans, including any requirements regarding living conditions, lifestyle requirements, and monitoring by family members, legal guardians, or others;

    d. Anticipated length of treatment; and

    e. Recommended crime-related prohibitions.

5. The court on its own motion may order, or on a motion by the state or the respondent shall order, a second examination. The evaluator shall be selected by the party making the motion. The requesting party shall pay the cost of any examination ordered under this subsection unless the requesting party is the offender, in which case the state shall pay the cost if no third-party insurance coverage is available.

6. [Empty]

    a.

The suspended disposition shall be granted unless the court makes an independent finding, supported by a preponderance of the evidence, that commitment to the department is needed because remaining in the community and being placed on community supervision, with a suspended commitment to the department, would not adequately protect the community. In making a finding the court shall consider the following factors:

        i. The severity of the offense or offenses for which the juvenile has most recently been adjudicated, including the juvenile's role in the offense, the juvenile's behavior, and harm done to victims;

        ii. The juvenile's criminal history, including the adequacy and success of previous attempts by the juvenile court to rehabilitate the juvenile;

        iii. Whether the programming, treatment, and education offered and provided in a juvenile rehabilitation facility is appropriate to meet the treatment and security needs of the juvenile;

        iv. Whether the goals of rehabilitation and community safety can be met by assigning the juvenile to a less restrictive disposition that is available to the court;

    v. The juvenile's age, developmental maturity, mental and emotional health, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and any disabilities or special needs impacting the safety or suitability of committing the juvenile to a term of confinement in juvenile court; and

    vi. Whether the juvenile and the community will benefit from use of this disposition alternative after considering any examinations ordered under this section and the victim's opinion regarding whether the juvenile should receive a suspended disposition under this section.

    b. If the court does not make the finding described in (a) of this subsection, the court shall establish in writing the conditions that the juvenile will be ordered to comply with on the suspended disposition.

    c. If the court orders this disposition alternative according to the requirements of this section, then the court shall impose the standard range for the offense, or if the court concludes, and enters reasons for its conclusion, that such disposition would effectuate a manifest injustice, the court shall impose a disposition above the standard range as indicated in option D of RCW 13.40.0357 if the disposition is an increase from the standard range , suspend execution of the disposition, and place the offender on community supervision for up to one year. At any time after the court suspends a disposition under this section, the court may continue community supervision for an additional one-year period for good cause. As a condition of the suspended disposition, the court shall require the offender to undergo available outpatient drug/alcohol, mental health, or co-occurring disorder treatment and/or inpatient mental health or drug/alcohol treatment. The court may impose a determinate sentence of electronic monitoring, if such electronic monitoring is available in the jurisdiction, for up to the minimum of the juvenile's standard range.

    d. The court shall only order inpatient treatment under this section if a funded bed is available. If the inpatient treatment is longer than 90 days, the court shall hold a review hearing every 30 days beyond the initial 90 days. The respondent may appear telephonically at these review hearings if in compliance with treatment.

    e. As a condition of the suspended disposition, the court may impose conditions of community supervision and other sanctions, including up to 30 days of confinement, 150 hours of community restitution, and payment of restitution. The court shall establish in writing the conditions the juvenile must follow to maintain the suspended disposition.

7. The mental health/co-occurring disorder/drug/alcohol treatment provider shall submit monthly reports on the respondent's progress in treatment to the court and the parties. The reports shall reference the treatment plan and include at a minimum the following: Dates of attendance, respondent's compliance with requirements, treatment activities, the respondent's relative progress in treatment, and any other material specified by the court at the time of the disposition.

At the time of the disposition, the court may set treatment review hearings as the court considers appropriate.

If the offender violates any condition of the disposition or the court finds that the respondent is failing to make satisfactory progress in treatment, the court may impose sanctions pursuant to RCW 13.40.200 or revoke the suspension and order execution of the disposition. The court shall give credit for any confinement time previously served if that confinement was for the offense for which the suspension is being revoked.

8. For purposes of this section, "victim" means any person who has sustained emotional, psychological, physical, or financial injury to person or property as a direct result of the offense charged. "Victim" may also include a known parent or guardian of a victim who is a minor child or is not a minor child but is incapacitated, incompetent, disabled, or deceased.

9. Whenever a juvenile offender is entitled to credit for time spent in detention prior to a dispositional order, the dispositional order shall specifically state the number of days of credit for time served.

10. In no case shall the term of confinement imposed by the court at disposition exceed that to which an adult could be subjected for the same offense.

11. A disposition under this section is  appealable under RCW 13.40.230.

12. Subject to funds appropriated for this specific purpose, the costs incurred by the juvenile courts for the mental health, substance use disorder, and/or co-occurring disorder evaluations, treatment, and costs of supervision required under this section shall be paid by the health care authority.

13. A juvenile, or the parent, guardian, or other person having custody of the juvenile shall not be required to pay the cost of any evaluation or treatment ordered under this section.

## Section 4
1. [Empty]

    a. Any term of confinement imposed for an offense which exceeds 30 days shall be served under the supervision of the department, although the juvenile court maintains concurrent jurisdiction with the department over the person, only for the purposes of conducting review hearings described under this section and any community supervision that is ordered if a person is released at the review hearing. If the period of confinement imposed for more than one offense exceeds 30 days but the term imposed for each offense is less than 30 days or if the court orders electronic monitoring up to the minimum of the standard range under RCW 13.40.165(6)(c) and 13.40.0357, the confinement may, in the discretion of the court, be served in a juvenile facility operated by or pursuant to a contract with the state or a county.

    b. If fewer than 30 days remain until the release date set in accordance with RCW 13.40.210(1) after accounting for the number of days of credit for time served stated in the dispositional order, then the remainder of the confinement may be served in the custody of the county, at the discretion of the juvenile court administrator following review of the availability of placement, services, and reentry supports. Any time to be served by a youth in county custody shall be subject to a contractual agreement with the department which accounts for costs associated with the confinement of the juvenile. Any existing contractual agreements as of January 1, 2026, created by the department and a juvenile court administrator to confine a person locally pending transport of the person to a juvenile rehabilitation facility after sentencing do not apply to this subsection.

2. Whenever a person is confined in a detention facility or is committed to the department, the court may not directly order a person into a particular county or state facility. The juvenile court administrator and the secretary or the secretary's designee, as appropriate, has the sole discretion to determine in which facility a person should be confined or committed. The counties may operate a variety of detention facilities as determined by the county legislative authority subject to available funds.

3. Excluding the offenses listed in RCW 13.40.160(1)(d), the juvenile court maintains concurrent jurisdiction with the department over a person who is committed to the department, except the court's concurrent jurisdiction may be only for the purposes of scheduling and conducting a review hearing at the midpoint of the minimum range, provided the review does not occur until after the person has served at least six months in the custody of the department, and imposing any community supervision that is ordered if a person is released at the review hearing.

    a. The department shall provide a report, which must be included in the social file as defined under RCW 13.50.010, to the juvenile court at least 14 days before each review hearing detailing:

        i. The services received by the person;

        ii. Any infractions committed by the person;

        iii. Whether the person is participating in available, appropriate programming; and

        iv. How often the person has been under room confinement due to staffing issues or overpopulation and whether there have been any major disruptions to programming in the three months preceding the review hearing.

    b. [Empty]

        i. Before conducting a review under this section, the court shall confirm, based on the report provided in (a) of this subsection, that the person is participating in available, appropriate programming.

        ii. If the court determines that the requirement in (b)(i) of this subsection is satisfied, the court shall consider the person's progress and input of the victim, and after considering the factors listed under RCW 13.40.165(6)(a), the court may release the person from the custody of the department, no less than 14 days after the review hearing and no more than 21 days, and place the person on up to a year of community supervision administered by the county, unless the person is subject to parole as assigned under RCW 13.40.210(3), in which case the person shall be released to parole rather than community supervision.

    c. If a respondent is committed for multiple offenses, the midpoint will be calculated for purposes of this subsection (3) by adding together the ranges ordered for any offenses that are being served consecutively. If a respondent is committed for multiple offenses and if any offense is ineligible for a midpoint review hearing, the respondent may not receive a midpoint review hearing. At the disposition hearing, the court must determine whether any offenses for which the respondent is being committed to the department are eligible for a review under this subsection (3). Once the respondent's minimum range and midpoint review hearing date are calculated, the department shall provide that information to the court.

    d. The prosecutor shall provide notice to the victim at least one month before each review hearing described under this subsection, if the victim requests such notice be provided.

    e. The respondent shall appear remotely for the hearing described under this subsection, unless ordered by the court to appear in person.

4. A person has the right to be represented by counsel during a review hearing described under subsection (3) of this section.

ADJUDICATIONS

NOTE: References in the grid to days or weeks mean periods of confinement. "LS" means "local sanctions" as defined in RCW 13.40.020.

1. The vertical axis of the grid is the current offense category. The current offense category is determined by the offense of adjudication.

2. The horizontal axis of the grid is the number of prior adjudications included in the juvenile's criminal history. Each prior felony adjudication shall count as one point. Each prior violation, misdemeanor, and gross misdemeanor adjudication shall count as 1/4 point. Fractional points shall be rounded down.

3. The standard range disposition for each offense is determined by the intersection of the column defined by the prior adjudications and the row defined by the current offense category.

4. RCW 13.40.180 applies if the offender is being sentenced for more than one offense.

5. A current offense that is a violation is equivalent to an offense category of E. However, a disposition for a violation shall not include confinement.

1. If the offender is subject to a standard range disposition involving confinement by the department, the court may impose the standard range and suspend the disposition on condition that the offender comply with one or more local sanctions and any educational or treatment requirement.

The treatment programs provided to the offender must be either research-based best practice programs as identified by the Washington state institute for public policy or the joint legislative audit and review committee, or for chemical dependency treatment programs or services, they must be evidence-based or research-based best practice programs. For the purposes of this subsection:

    a. "Evidence-based" means a program or practice that has had multiple site random controlled trials across heterogeneous populations demonstrating that the program or practice is effective for the population; and

    b. "Research-based" means a program or practice that has some research demonstrating effectiveness, but that does not yet meet the standard of evidence-based practices.

2. If the offender fails to comply with the suspended disposition, the court may impose sanctions pursuant to RCW 13.40.200 or may revoke the suspended disposition and order the disposition's execution.

3. An offender is ineligible for the suspended disposition option under this section if the offender:

    a. Is adjudicated of an A+ or A++ offense;

    b. Is fourteen years of age or older and is adjudicated of one or more of the following offenses:

        i. A class A felony offense as described under RCW 9A.20.020, or an attempt, conspiracy, or solicitation to commit a class A felony offense as described under RCW 9A.20.020;

        ii. Manslaughter in the first degree (RCW 9A.32.060);

        iii. Extortion in the first degree (RCW 9A.56.120), kidnapping in the second degree (RCW 9A.40.030), drive-by shooting (RCW 9A.36.045), vehicular homicide (RCW 46.61.520), hit and run death (RCW 46.52.020(4)(a)), or manslaughter 2 (RCW 9A.32.070); or

        iv. Violation of the uniform controlled substances act (RCW 69.50.401(2) (a) and (b)), when the offense includes infliction of bodily harm upon another or when during the commission or immediate withdrawal from the offense the respondent was armed with a deadly weapon;

    c.

Is adjudicated of a sex offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030; or

    d. Is adjudicated of robbery in the first degree (RCW 9A.56.200).

The court may impose a disposition alternative under the conditions described under this section, RCW 13.40.160(4), and RCW 13.40.165.

If the court determines that a disposition under option A, B, or C would effectuate a manifest injustice, the court shall impose a disposition outside the standard range under RCW 13.40.160(2).

## Section 6
1. The secretary shall set a release date for each juvenile committed to its custody. The department shall prioritize setting the release date for juveniles who would serve less than 30 days under the supervision of the department. The release date shall be within the prescribed range to which a juvenile has been committed under RCW 13.40.0357 or 13.40.030 except as provided in RCW 13.40.320 concerning offenders the department determines are eligible for the juvenile offender basic training camp program. Such dates shall be determined prior to the expiration of 60 percent of a juvenile's minimum term of confinement included within the prescribed range to which the juvenile has been committed. The secretary shall release any juvenile committed to the custody of the department within four calendar days prior to the juvenile's release date or on the release date set under this chapter. Days spent in the custody of the department shall be tolled by any period of time during which a juvenile :

    a. Has absented themself from the department's supervision without the prior approval of the secretary or the secretary's designee; and

    b. Is confined in a county jail under RCW 13.40.205(2)(b) after being sentenced on an adult conviction with a maximum term of confinement of 364 days or less in a county jail.

2. The secretary shall monitor the average daily population of the state's juvenile residential facilities. When the secretary concludes that in-residence population of residential facilities exceeds 105 percent of the rated bed capacity specified in statute, or in absence of such specification, as specified by the department in rule, the secretary may recommend reductions to the governor. On certification by the governor that the recommended reductions are necessary, the secretary has authority to administratively release a sufficient number of offenders to reduce in-residence population to 100 percent of rated bed capacity. The secretary shall release those offenders who have served the greatest proportion of their sentence. However, the secretary may deny release in a particular case at the request of an offender, or if the secretary finds that there is no responsible custodian, as determined by the department, to whom to release the offender, or if the release of the offender would pose a clear danger to society. The department shall notify the committing court of the release at the time of release if any such early releases have occurred as a result of excessive in-residence population. In no event shall an offender adjudicated of a violent offense be granted release under the provisions of this subsection.

3. [Empty]

    a. Following the release of any juvenile under subsection (1) of this section, the secretary may require the juvenile to comply with a program of parole to be administered by the department in his or her community which shall last no longer than 18 months, except that in the case of a juvenile sentenced for a sex offense as defined under RCW 9.94A.030 the period of parole shall be 24 months and, in the discretion of the secretary, may be up to 36 months when the secretary finds that an additional period of parole is necessary and appropriate in the interests of public safety or to meet the ongoing needs of the juvenile. A parole program is mandatory for offenders released under subsection (2) of this section and for offenders who receive a juvenile residential commitment sentence for theft of a motor vehicle, possession of a stolen motor vehicle, or taking a motor vehicle without permission 1. A juvenile adjudicated for unlawful possession of a firearm, possession of a stolen firearm, theft of a firearm, or drive-by shooting may participate in aggression replacement training, functional family therapy, or functional family parole aftercare if the juvenile meets eligibility requirements for these services. The decision to place an offender in an evidence-based parole program shall be based on an assessment by the department of the offender's risk for reoffending upon release and an assessment of the ongoing treatment needs of the juvenile. The department shall prioritize available parole resources to provide supervision and services to offenders at moderate to high risk for reoffending.

    b. The secretary shall, for the period of parole, facilitate the juvenile's reintegration into his or her community and to further this goal shall require the juvenile to refrain from possessing a firearm or using a deadly weapon, and refrain from committing new offenses or violating any orders issued by the juvenile court pursuant to chapter 7.105 RCW, and may require the juvenile to: (i) Undergo available medical, psychiatric, drug and alcohol, sex offender, mental health, and other offense-related treatment services; (ii) report as directed to a parole officer and/or designee; (iii) pursue a course of study, vocational training, or employment; (iv) notify the parole officer of the current address where he or she resides; (v) be present at a particular address during specified hours; (vi) remain within prescribed geographical boundaries; (vii) submit to electronic monitoring; (viii) refrain from using illegal drugs and alcohol, and submit to random urinalysis when requested by the assigned parole officer; (ix) refrain from contact with specific individuals or a specified class of individuals; (x) meet other conditions determined by the parole officer to further enhance the juvenile's reintegration into the community; (xi) pay any court-ordered fines or restitution; and (xii) perform community restitution. Community restitution for the purpose of this section means compulsory service, without compensation, performed for the benefit of the community by the offender. Community restitution may be performed through public or private organizations or through work crews.

    c. The secretary may further require up to 25 percent of the highest risk juvenile offenders who are placed on parole to participate in an intensive supervision program. Offenders participating in an intensive supervision program shall be required to comply with all terms and conditions listed in (b) of this subsection and shall also be required to comply with the following additional terms and conditions: (i) Obey all laws and refrain from any conduct that threatens public safety; (ii) report at least once a week to an assigned community case manager; and (iii) meet all other requirements imposed by the community case manager related to participating in the intensive supervision program. As a part of the intensive supervision program, the secretary may require day reporting.

    d. After termination of the parole period, the juvenile shall be discharged from the department's supervision.

4. [Empty]

    a. The department may also modify parole for violation thereof. If, after affording a juvenile all of the due process rights to which he or she would be entitled if the juvenile were an adult, the secretary finds that a juvenile has violated a condition of his or her parole, the secretary shall order one of the following which is reasonably likely to effectuate the purpose of the parole and to protect the public: (i) Continued supervision under the same conditions previously imposed; (ii) intensified supervision with increased reporting requirements; (iii) additional conditions of supervision authorized by this chapter; (iv) except as provided in (a)(v) and (vi) of this subsection, imposition of a period of confinement not to exceed thirty days in a facility operated by or pursuant to a contract with the state of Washington or any city or county for a portion of each day or for a certain number of days each week with the balance of the days or weeks spent under supervision; (v) the secretary may order any of the conditions or may return the offender to confinement for the remainder of the sentence range if the offense for which the offender was sentenced is rape in the first or second degree, rape of a child in the first or second degree, child molestation in the first degree, indecent liberties with forcible compulsion, or a sex offense that is also a serious violent offense as defined by RCW 9.94A.030; and (vi) the secretary may order any of the conditions or may return the offender to confinement for the remainder of the sentence range if the youth has completed the basic training camp program as described in RCW 13.40.320.

    b. The secretary may modify parole and order any of the conditions or may return the offender to confinement for up to twenty-four weeks if the offender was sentenced for a sex offense as defined under RCW 9A.44.128 and is known to have violated the terms of parole. Confinement beyond thirty days is intended to only be used for a small and limited number of sex offenders. It shall only be used when other graduated sanctions or interventions have not been effective or the behavior is so egregious it warrants the use of the higher level intervention and the violation: (i) Is a known pattern of behavior consistent with a previous sex offense that puts the youth at high risk for reoffending sexually; (ii) consists of sexual behavior that is determined to be predatory as defined in RCW 71.09.020; or (iii) requires a review under chapter 71.09 RCW, due to a recent overt act. The total number of days of confinement for violations of parole conditions during the parole period shall not exceed the number of days provided by the maximum sentence imposed by the disposition for the underlying offense pursuant to RCW 13.40.0357. The department shall not aggregate multiple parole violations that occur prior to the parole revocation hearing and impose consecutive 24 week periods of confinement for each parole violation. The department is authorized to engage in rule making pursuant to chapter 34.05 RCW, to implement this subsection, including narrowly defining the behaviors that could lead to this higher level intervention.

    c. If the department finds that any juvenile in a program of parole has possessed a firearm or used a deadly weapon during the program of parole, the department shall modify the parole under (a) of this subsection and confine the juvenile for at least 30 days. Confinement shall be in a facility operated by or pursuant to a contract with the state or any county.

5. A parole officer of the department of children, youth, and families shall have the power to arrest a juvenile under his or her supervision on the same grounds as a law enforcement officer would be authorized to arrest the person.

6. If so requested and approved under chapter 13.06 RCW, the secretary shall permit a county or group of counties to perform functions under subsections (3) through (5) of this section.

## Section 7
1. Dispositions reviewed pursuant to RCW 13.40.160 shall be reviewed in the appropriate division of the court of appeals.

An appeal under this section shall be heard solely upon the record that was before the disposition court. No written briefs may be required, and the appeal shall be heard within thirty days following the date of sentencing and a decision rendered within fifteen days following the argument. The supreme court shall promulgate any necessary rules to effectuate the purposes of this section.

2. To uphold a disposition outside the standard range, the court of appeals must find: (a) That the reasons supplied by the disposition judge are supported by the record which was before the judge and that those reasons clearly and convincingly support the conclusion that a disposition within the range would constitute a manifest injustice; and (b) that the sentence imposed was neither clearly excessive nor clearly too lenient.

3. If the court does not find subsection (2)(a) of this section it shall remand the case for disposition within the standard range.

4. If the court finds subsection (2)(a) of this section but not subsection (2)(b) of this section it shall remand the case with instructions for further proceedings consistent with the provisions of this chapter.

5. To uphold a finding under RCW 13.40.165(6)(a), the court of appeals must find: (a) That the reasons supplied by the disposition judge are supported by the record which was before the judge; and (b) that those reasons support the conclusion, by the preponderance of the evidence, that commitment to the department is needed because a community-based placement would not adequately protect the community.

6. The disposition court may impose conditions on release pending appeal as provided in RCW 13.40.040(5) and 13.40.050(6).

7. Appeal of a disposition under this section does not affect the finality or appeal of the underlying adjudication of guilt.

## Section 8
1. Except as provided in (a) through (c) of this subsection, a juvenile offender may not be committed by the juvenile court to the department for placement in a juvenile rehabilitation facility beyond the juvenile offender's 21st birthday.

    a. A juvenile offender adjudicated of an  juvenile disposition category offense listed in RCW 13.40.0357, or found to be armed with a firearm and sentenced to an additional 12 months pursuant to RCW 13.40.193(3)(b), may be committed by the juvenile court to the department for placement in a juvenile rehabilitation facility up to the juvenile offender's 25th birthday, but not beyond.

    b. A juvenile offender adjudicated of a murder in the first or second degree offense committed at age 14 or older or a juvenile offender adjudicated of a rape in the first degree offense committed at age 15 or older may be committed by the juvenile court to the department for placement in a juvenile rehabilitation facility up to the juvenile offender's 23rd birthday, but not beyond.

    c. A juvenile offender who is 18 or older at the time of the adjudication may be committed by the juvenile court to the department for placement in a juvenile rehabilitation facility up to the juvenile offender's 23rd birthday, but not beyond, in order to serve a standard range disposition.

2. [Empty]

    a. The juvenile court has jurisdiction over, and may place an individual under the authority of the department in the following circumstances:

        i. Except as provided under RCW 13.04.030 and 13.40.110, when the individual is under the age of 21 at the time of the filing of the information and is accused of committing a criminal offense that occurred when the individual was under the age of 18; or

        ii. If proceedings are pending in a case in which jurisdiction is vested in the adult criminal court pursuant to RCW 13.04.030 and an automatic extension is required because either:

(A) The individual is found not guilty of the charge for which he or she was transferred, or is convicted in the adult criminal court of an offense that is not also an offense listed in RCW 13.04.030(1)(e)(v), and the matter is transferred to juvenile court pursuant to RCW 13.04.030(1)(e)(v)(C)(II); or

(B) The parties agree to juvenile court jurisdiction with the court's approval pursuant to RCW 13.04.030(1)(e)(v)(C)(III).

    b. Upon a finding of guilt in juvenile court, the juvenile court maintains jurisdiction to allow for imposition, execution, and enforcement of the court's order of disposition, subject to the limitations in this section.

3. If an order of disposition imposes a commitment to the department for a juvenile offender:

    a. Adjudicated of an  juvenile disposition category offense listed in RCW 13.40.0357, adjudicated of a murder in the first or second degree offense committed at age 14 or older, or found to be armed with a firearm and sentenced to an additional 12 months pursuant to RCW 13.40.193(3)(b), then jurisdiction for parole is automatically extended to include a period of up to 24 months of parole, in no case extending beyond the offender's 25th birthday; or

    b. Adjudicated of a rape in the first degree offense committed at age 15 or older, then jurisdiction for parole is automatically extended to include a period of no less than 24 months and no more than 36 months of parole, in no case extending beyond the offender's 25th birthday.

4. Pursuant to the terms of RCW 13.40.190, the juvenile court maintains jurisdiction beyond the juvenile offender's 21st birthday for the purpose of enforcing an order of restitution or penalty assessment.

5. Except as otherwise provided herein, in no event may the juvenile court have authority to extend jurisdiction over any juvenile offender beyond the juvenile offender's 21st birthday.

6. Notwithstanding any extension of jurisdiction over a person pursuant to this section, the juvenile court has no jurisdiction over any offenses alleged to have been committed by a person 18 years of age or older.

7. The juvenile court maintains jurisdiction beyond the juvenile offender's 21st birthday to place the juvenile offender on community supervision for a suspended disposition and, if the suspended disposition is revoked, to commit the juvenile offender to the department for placement in a juvenile rehabilitation facility.

## Section 9
1. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the sentence of a prisoner or respondent confined in a county jail facility or county detention facility for a felony, gross misdemeanor, or misdemeanor conviction may be reduced by earned release credits in accordance with procedures that shall be developed and promulgated by the correctional agency having jurisdiction. The earned early release time shall be for good behavior and good performance as determined by the correctional agency having jurisdiction. Any program established pursuant to this section shall allow an offender to earn early release credits for presentence incarceration. The correctional institution shall not credit the offender with earned early release credits in advance of the offender actually earning the credits. In the case of an offender convicted of a serious violent offense or a sex offense that is a class A felony committed on or after July 1, 1990, the aggregate earned early release time may not exceed fifteen percent of the sentence. In no other case may the aggregate earned early release time exceed one-third of the total sentence.

2. An offender serving a term of confinement imposed under RCW 9.94A.670(5)(a) is not eligible for earned release credits under this section.

3. If a person is transferred from a county jail or juvenile detention facility to the department or the department of children, youth, and families, the administrator of a county jail facility or juvenile detention facility shall certify to the department or the department of children, youth, and families the amount of time spent in custody at the facility and the number of days of early release credits lost or not earned.

## Section 10
1. Except when the court imposes a suspended disposition under RCW 13.40.165 or 13.40.0357, if a respondent is found to have been in possession of a firearm in violation of RCW 9.41.040(2)(a)(v), the court shall impose a minimum disposition of ten days of confinement. Except when the court imposes a suspended disposition under RCW 13.40.165 or 13.40.0357, if the offender's standard range of disposition for the offense as indicated in RCW 13.40.0357 is more than 30 days of confinement, the court shall commit the offender to the department for the standard range disposition. Except when the court imposes a suspended disposition under RCW 13.40.165 or 13.40.0357, the offender shall not be released until the offender has served a minimum of 10 days in confinement.

2. [Empty]

    a. If a respondent is found to have been in possession of a firearm in violation of RCW 9.41.040, the disposition must include a requirement that the respondent participate in a qualifying program as described in (b) of this subsection, when available, unless the court makes a written finding based on the outcome of the juvenile court risk assessment that participation in a qualifying program would not be appropriate.

    b. For purposes of this section, "qualifying program" means an aggression replacement training program, a functional family therapy program, or another program applicable to the juvenile firearm offender population that has been identified as evidence-based or research-based and cost-beneficial in the current list prepared at the direction of the legislature by the Washington state institute for public policy.

3. If the court finds that the respondent or an accomplice was armed with a firearm, the court shall determine the standard range disposition for the offense pursuant to RCW 13.40.160. If the offender or an accomplice was armed with a firearm when the offender committed any felony other than possession of a machine gun or bump-fire stock, possession of a stolen firearm, drive-by shooting, theft of a firearm, unlawful possession of a firearm in the first and second degree, or use of a machine gun or bump-fire stock in a felony, the following periods of total confinement must be added to the sentence: (a) Except for (b) of this subsection, for a class A felony, six months; for a class B felony, four months; and for a class C felony, two months; (b) for any violent offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030, committed by a respondent who is sixteen or seventeen years old at the time of the offense, a period of twelve months. The additional time shall be imposed regardless of the offense's juvenile disposition offense category as designated in RCW 13.40.0357.

4. [Empty]

    a. If the court finds that the respondent who is sixteen or seventeen years old and committed the offense of robbery in the first degree, drive-by shooting, rape of a child in the first degree, burglary in the first degree, or any violent offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030 and was armed with a firearm, and the court finds that the respondent's participation was related to membership in a criminal street gang or advancing the benefit, aggrandizement, gain, profit, or other advantage for a criminal street gang, a period of three months total confinement must be added to the sentence. The additional time must be imposed regardless of the offense's juvenile disposition offense category as designated in RCW 13.40.0357 and must be served consecutively with any other sentencing enhancement.

    b. For the purposes of this section, "criminal street gang" means any ongoing organization, association, or group of three or more persons, whether formal or informal, having a common name or common identifying sign or symbol, having as one of its primary activities the commission of criminal acts, and whose members or associates individually or collectively engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal street gang activity. This definition does not apply to employees engaged in concerted activities for their mutual aid and protection, or to the activities of labor and bona fide nonprofit organizations or their members or agents.

5. When a disposition under this section would effectuate a manifest injustice, the court may impose another disposition. When a judge finds a manifest injustice and imposes a disposition of confinement exceeding thirty days, the court shall commit the juvenile to a maximum term, and the provisions of RCW 13.40.030(2) shall be used to determine the range. When a judge finds a manifest injustice and imposes a disposition of confinement less than thirty days, the disposition shall be comprised of confinement or community supervision or both.

6. Any term of confinement ordered pursuant to this section shall run consecutively to any term of confinement imposed in the same disposition for other offenses.

## Section 11
1. Except when the court imposes a suspended disposition under RCW 13.40.165 or 13.40.0357, if a respondent is adjudicated of taking a motor vehicle without permission in the first degree as defined in RCW 9A.56.070, the court shall impose the following minimum sentence, in addition to any restitution the court may order payable to the victim:

    a. Juveniles with a prior criminal history score of zero to one-half points shall be sentenced to a standard range sentence that includes no less than three months of community supervision, forty‑five hours of community restitution, and a requirement that the juvenile remain at home such that the juvenile is confined to a private residence for no less than five days. The juvenile may be subject to electronic monitoring where available. If the juvenile is enrolled in school, the confinement shall be served on nonschool days;

    b. Juveniles with a prior criminal history score of three-quarters to one and one-half points shall be sentenced to a standard range sentence that includes six months of community supervision, no less than ten days of detention, and ninety hours of community restitution; and

    c. Juveniles with a prior criminal history score of two or more points shall be sentenced to no less than fifteen to thirty-six weeks commitment to the juvenile rehabilitation administration, four months of parole supervision, and ninety hours of community restitution.

2. Except when the court imposes a suspended disposition under RCW 13.40.165 or 13.40.0357, if a respondent is adjudicated of theft of a motor vehicle as defined under RCW 9A.56.065, or possession of a stolen vehicle as defined under RCW 9A.56.068, the court shall impose the following minimum sentence, in addition to any restitution the court may order payable to the victim:

    a. Juveniles with a prior criminal history score of zero to one-half points shall be sentenced to a standard range sentence that includes no less than three months of community supervision and either ninety hours of community restitution or a requirement that the juvenile remain at home such that the juvenile is confined in a private residence for no less than five days, or a combination thereof that includes a minimum of three days home confinement and a minimum of forty hours of community restitution.

    a. Juveniles with a prior criminal history score of zero to one-half points shall be sentenced to a standard range sentence that includes three months of community supervision, fifteen hours of community restitution, and a requirement that the juvenile remain at home such that the juvenile is confined in a private residence for no less than one day. If the juvenile is enrolled in school, the confinement shall be served on nonschool days. The juvenile may be subject to electronic monitoring where available;
