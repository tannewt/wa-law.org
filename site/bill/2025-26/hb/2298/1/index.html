<p>Each county auditor is authorized to develop and implement a voluntary property title protection program to prevent land record fraud. A county auditor may coordinate with the county treasurer or excise agent in developing the program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A voluntary property title protection program may give property owners the option to record with the county auditor a property fraud protection instrument in order to prohibit the recording of any transfer of ownership of that property without the use of a secure personal identification number, an approved override process, or until a release of fraud protection instrument for the same property is recorded. The program must allow for an emergency override process through verified court orders or authorized legal representative actions.</p>

<p>If a county auditor receives any instrument transferring ownership of real property for which a fraud protection instrument has been recorded, the auditor may delay the recording of such instrument or entering of such instrument on the transfer record for up to five business days.</p>
