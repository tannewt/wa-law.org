## Section 1
1. [Empty]

    a. Each county auditor is authorized to develop and implement a voluntary property title protection program to prevent land record fraud. A county auditor may coordinate with the county treasurer or excise agent in developing the program.

    b. A voluntary property title protection program may give property owners the option to record with the county auditor a property fraud protection instrument in order to prohibit the recording of any transfer of ownership of that property without the use of a secure personal identification number, an approved override process, or until a release of fraud protection instrument for the same property is recorded. The program must allow for an emergency override process through verified court orders or authorized legal representative actions.

2. If a county auditor receives any instrument transferring ownership of real property for which a fraud protection instrument has been recorded, the auditor may delay the recording of such instrument or entering of such instrument on the transfer record for up to five business days.

3. A county treasurer, or excise agent, may delay processing a real estate excise tax refund application for up to 5 days if the property for which the refund application is submitted is the subject of a recorded fraud protection instrument.

## Section 2
The auditor or recording officer must, upon the payment of the fees as required in RCW 36.18.010 for the same, acknowledge receipt therefor in writing or printed form and record in large and well bound books, or by photographic, photomechanical, electronic format, or other approved process, the following:
