<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that nearly 65 percent of the world's population has textured hair, resulting in a market of approximately one billion people, yet many clients with textured hair report not having equitable access to professionally trained and licensed stylists with the skill set and experience to provide services for textured hair.</p>
<p>The legislature also finds that in the appearance enhancement industry, current standards for training and qualifications tend to only apply to individuals with fine, straight hair. As such, students attending schools of cosmetology or natural hair styling may complete training programs without a full understanding of how to maintain, treat, and style a diverse range of hair textures including curly, coiled, coarse, and thick hair. This institutionalized gap in knowledge can result in harm to health and damage to the hair of clients from varying cultural and ethnic backgrounds.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to establish a process to empower cosmetologists with the skills and confidence to consult and work with clients with textured hair while maintaining the industry health and safety standards.</p>
