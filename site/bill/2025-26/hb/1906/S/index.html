<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that water systems provide a critical utility service to the residents of Washington state, and due to scale economies, generally function as a natural monopoly in a given area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the utilities and transportation commission, the regulating agency responsible for approving water system rate changes and ensuring adequate consumer protections, does not have specific statutory standards to guide its review and approval of proposed water system rate changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that water systems are subject to a number of public health standards and requirements from the department of health that require comprehensive planning and capital investments to ensure that residents have continuous access to safe drinking water. The costs of these critical investments are reflected in rate changes in order to provide a reasonable rate of return and keep a water company in business. However, planning materials and information supporting capital investments are not currently required to be shared with the utilities and transportation commission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds the current rate setting process does not provide the utilities and transportation commission sufficient structure or guidance to determine whether capital improvement costs included in a proposed water rate change are prudently incurred and will result in rates that are just, fair, reasonable, and sufficient. Likewise, the water system ratepayers subject to the change are not provided sufficient notice of planned system investments and their anticipated impacts on rates, which can lead to sudden and significant rate increases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to provide additional structure and guidance to the water system rate setting process in order to enable the utilities and transportation commission to effectively regulate in this area as a consumer protection agency. The legislature also intends to increase notice and transparency to consumers about water companies' planned investments and their impacts by leveraging the existing planning process required for safe drinking water standards.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
