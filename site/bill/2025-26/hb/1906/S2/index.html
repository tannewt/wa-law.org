<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that water systems provide a critical utility service to the residents of Washington state, and due to scale economies, generally function as a natural monopoly in a given area. The legislature finds that due to the many challenges facing public water systems, regional solutions are a preferred alternative to ensuring economies of scale to keep water supply affordable. Public ownership of water systems with a competent public entity is preferred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the utilities and transportation commission, the regulating agency responsible for approving water system rate changes and ensuring adequate consumer protections for privately owned, for-profit public water systems, does not have specific statutory standards to guide its review and approval of proposed water system rate changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that water systems are subject to a number of public health standards and requirements from the department of health that require comprehensive planning and capital investments to ensure that residents have continuous access to safe drinking water. The costs of these critical investments are reflected in rate changes in order to provide a reasonable rate of return and keep a water company in business. However, planning materials and information supporting capital investments are not currently required to be shared with the utilities and transportation commission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds the current rate setting process does not provide the utilities and transportation commission sufficient structure or guidance to determine whether capital improvement costs included in a proposed water rate change are prudently incurred and will result in rates that are just, fair, reasonable, and sufficient. Likewise, the water system ratepayers subject to the change are not provided sufficient notice of planned system investments and their anticipated impacts on rates, which can lead to sudden and significant rate increases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to provide additional structure and guidance to the water system rate setting process in order to enable the utilities and transportation commission to effectively regulate in this area as a consumer protection agency. The legislature also intends to increase notice and transparency to consumers about water companies' planned investments and their impacts by leveraging the existing planning process required for safe drinking water standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that a growing number of small, failing, or financially distressed water systems are unable to reliably meet public health, operational, and financial requirements, resulting in higher long-term costs, service disruptions, and increased risks to public health and ratepayers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that consolidation of failing water systems into existing, well-managed publicly owned water systems, where feasible, can improve operational efficiency, enhance regulatory compliance, stabilize rates over time, and better protect public health and consumer interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends that for small water systems, consolidation into an existing publicly owned water system is the preferred outcome when addressing failing or nonviable water systems, provided that such consolidation is technically feasible, financially reasonable, and does not adversely impact the customers of the receiving public water system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that, in circumstances where no existing publicly owned water system is reasonably able or willing to assume ownership or operation of a failing system, transfer to or acquisition by a regulated private water company may be an appropriate alternative to ensure continuity of service and protection of public health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends that private acquisition of a failing water system should occur only after reasonable efforts have been made by the water system to evaluate consolidation with existing publicly owned water systems and such options are determined by the publicly owned utility to be infeasible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that successful consolidation of failing water systems requires active state support, including technical assistance, planning support, and financial resources, to reduce barriers to consolidation and avoid undue cost impacts on customers of receiving systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends that the state of Washington support system consolidation efforts through coordinated technical assistance and access to financial tools including, but not limited to, grants, loans, and other funding mechanisms, in order to promote sustainable water systems and protect public health and ratepayers statewide.</p>

<p>(A) The county in which any water system is located;</p>
<p>(B) Any water district or public utility district operating water systems within such county; and</p>

    ii. Provide treatment adequate to assure that the public health is protected;

    iii. Provide and effectively operate and maintain public water system facilities;

    iv. Plan for future growth and assure the availability of safe and reliable drinking water;

v. Provide the department with the current names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the owners, operators, and emergency contact persons for the system, including any changes to this information, and provide to users the name and 24 hour telephone number of an emergency contact person;

vi. Submit water system plans, small water system management plans, or engineering documents as required by the department; and

vii. Take whatever investigative or corrective action is necessary to assure that a safe and reliable drinking water supply is continuously available to users.

<li>
<p>No new group A public water system may be approved or created unless: (a) It is owned or operated by a satellite system management agency established under RCW 70A.100.130 and the satellite system management system complies with financial viability requirements of the department; or (b) a satellite management system is not available and it is determined that the new system has sufficient management and financial resources to provide safe and reliable service. The approval of any new system that is not owned by a satellite system management agency shall be conditioned upon future management or ownership by a satellite system management agency, if such management or ownership can be made with reasonable economy and efficiency, or upon periodic review of the system's operational history to determine its ability to meet the department's financial viability and other operating requirements. The department and local health jurisdictions shall enforce this requirement under authority provided under this chapter, chapter 70A.100 or 70.05 RCW, or other authority governing the approval of new water systems by the department or a local jurisdiction.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>No public service company shall sell, lease, assign or otherwise dispose of the whole or any part of its franchises, properties or facilities whatsoever, which are necessary or useful in the performance of its duties to the public, and no public service company shall, by any means whatsoever, directly or indirectly, merge or consolidate any of its franchises, properties or facilities with any other public service company, without having secured from the commission an order authorizing it to do so. The commission shall not approve any transaction under this section that would result in a person, directly or indirectly, acquiring a controlling interest in a gas, water, or electrical company without a finding that the transaction would provide a net benefit to the customers of the company. Prior to approving any transaction under this section that would result in a change of a controlling interest in a water company, the commission shall verify that the company has provided notification to the county in which any water system of the company is located, any water district or public utility district operating water systems within such county, any adjacent water systems, and customers of the company and provided the customers with a right of first refusal to purchase the water system.</p>
