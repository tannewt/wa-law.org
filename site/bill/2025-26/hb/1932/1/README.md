# HB 1932 - Cannabis consumption

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1932.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that consumers who legally purchase cannabis products from Washington's licensed and regulated cannabis market lack legal pathways to responsibly consume cannabis products in safe and regulated environments outside of their homes. Some living situations do not allow the use of cannabis, and so for many people there remains no legal and practical pathways to consume cannabis under Washington law. The legislature finds that creating a legal pathway for cannabis consumption is within the spirit of Initiative Measure No. 502, which called for bringing cannabis under a tightly regulated, state-licensed system similar to that for controlling hard alcohol. Washington's cannabis market has grown and matured substantially since 2012; it is time to continue the considered evolution of the industry by creating legal environments where adult consumers age 21 and over may purchase and consume cannabis products on-site in designated consumption areas. The legislature finds that by creating a cannabis event organizer license as a new license type to conduct a limited number of events each year, subject to statutory and regulatory requirements, local government ordinances, and regulation by the liquor and cannabis board, Washington can follow the lead of other states that have successfully legalized cannabis consumption events or activities and entrusted their citizens to partake responsibly.

## Section 2
1. There is a cannabis consumption event organizer license available to a person or entity that does not hold a cannabis license under this chapter. The license authorizes the holder to organize and conduct consumption events at specified locations on specified dates and times approved by the board at which adults age 21 and over may purchase single-use cannabis products and ready-to-consume cannabis products from the licensed cannabis consumption event organizer or from participating cannabis producers, processors, and retailers, and consume single-use cannabis products and ready-to-consume cannabis products in approved consumption areas by smoking, vaporization, consumption, or ingestion, subject to the requirements and limitations in this section. A maximum of one event per calendar month may be conducted under the cannabis consumption event organizer license, with each event lasting a maximum of three consecutive days, except that two years after the effective date of this section, the board, by rule, may increase the maximum number of events per calendar month and the maximum duration of each individual event. The possession, delivery, distribution, and sale of cannabis, single-use cannabis products, and ready-to-consume cannabis products in accordance with this chapter and the rules adopted to implement and enforce it, by a validly licensed cannabis consumption event organizer, shall not be a criminal or civil offense under Washington state law. Every cannabis consumption event organizer license must be issued in the name of the applicant, must specify the location of the cannabis consumption event organizer's principal location where the licensee will operate, which must be within the state of Washington, and the holder thereof may not allow any other person to use the license. The application fee is $500. Annual license renewal is $200. An event permit is required as provided in subsection (5) of this section. No licensed cannabis consumption event organizer or its employees may perform work involving sale or service of single-use cannabis products, or preparation, sale, or service of ready-to-consume cannabis products to the public unless the individual conducting the activity holds a valid budtender permit as provided in section 3 of this act.

        ii. A temporary structure, including a tent with walls and a covered top, may be used at a consumption event and the smoking or vaporizing of single-use cannabis products is allowed in the temporary structure if there is a ventilation and exhaust system capable of expelling odors generated in the consumption area, reducing volatile organic compounds as defined in 40 C.F.R. Sec. 51.100(s), and maintaining the standards for air quality in the cannabis consumption area as may be required by board rules.

The board may by rule establish the fee for a temporary on-site consumption event permit under this subsection, provided the fee may not exceed $500 per event. The event fee under this subsection (5)(a) for a licensee who obtained a license through the cannabis social equity program is waived through July 1, 2032.

The product must be in a locked storage compartment or container approved by the board and all remaining product must be returned back to the warehouse at the end of each day of the consumption event.

Licensees may choose to organize consumption events at which the sale of cannabis products is conducted only by participating cannabis producers, processors, and retailers.

    g. The licensee must designate a limited access area or areas that can only be accessed by the licensee, participating cannabis producers, processors, retailers, designated staff of such licensees, and the board.

    p. The licensee must comply with all local ordinances.

    q. The licensee must comply with any requirements in the rules of the board.

7. [Empty]

    a. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, the board may not issue more than one cannabis consumption event organizer license under this section to any one person.

    b.

8. For the purposes of this section, "public place" has the meaning provided in RCW 66.04.010, but the exclusions in RCW 66.04.011 do not apply.

## Section 3
1. [Empty]

    a. For employees of a cannabis consumption event organizer licensed under section 2 of this act, or employees of licensed cannabis producers, processors, or retailers authorized to participate in a consumption event under section 2 of this act, who perform work involving sale or service of single-use cannabis products to the public, or preparation, sale, or service of ready-to-consume cannabis products to the public, the employee must obtain a valid budtender permit before conducting such activities and working at a consumption event. A budtender permit is awarded upon successful completion of a budtender training program provided by, or approved by, the board. A budtender permit is valid for a period of two years unless the board takes enforcement action against the permit holder before the expiration of the permit and the permit is suspended or revoked by the board. The board must establish the elements of a budtender permit program, including permit fees, by rule.

    b. The budtender training program must cover topics including, but not limited to, responsible sales and service of cannabis, the prevention of overconsumption or impairment of a person with respect to cannabis, assisting persons who may experience negative effects of impairment by cannabis, differences in cannabis product types including delayed effects of certain edible products, considerations for inexperienced or first-time consumers of cannabis, and considerations for responsible transportation and avoiding violations of RCW 46.61.502 by customers. The board must consult with the department of health to ensure the curriculum of the budtender training program provided by the board does not include topics related to health or medical issues that are addressed in a training or education program leading to a medical cannabis consultant certificate established under RCW 69.51A.290. Topics that may be included in both the budtender training program and a medical cannabis consultant certificate training or education program are: State laws and rules related to cannabis, safe handling of cannabis products including single-use cannabis products and ready-to-consume cannabis products, and reducing access by minors to cannabis products.

2. [Empty]

    a. The board may suspend or revoke a budtender permit if it finds the permit holder has violated or permitted anyone to act in violation of this chapter. The board must immediately suspend the budtender permit of any person who has been certified under RCW 74.20A.320 as being a responsible parent who is not in compliance with a child support order.

    b. Suspension or revocation of an employee's budtender permit does not relieve a cannabis consumption event organizer licensee or licensed producer, processor, or retailer of responsibility for any action by one of its employees under this chapter. The board may, in its discretion, revoke or suspend either the budtender permit of an employee or the license of a cannabis consumption event organizer on whose premises the violation occurred, the license of the participating producer, processor, or retailer, or both the budtender permit and the cannabis business's license. The board's rules implementing this section must include provisions for appeal of its decision to suspend or revoke a budtender permit or the cannabis business's license or both the permit and the license.

    c. Budtender permit holders who have their permits suspended for failure to pay child support under RCW 74.20A.320 through 74.20A.330 must contact the department of social and health services to have the suspension released, and the department must notify the board when it determines the parent's noncompliance status has changed.

3. Any person who has had a budtender permit revoked may not seek or accept employment with a cannabis consumption event organizer, or with a cannabis producer, processor, or retailer, in a position involving sale or service of any cannabis product to the public for a period of at least one year following revocation of the budtender permit. It is a violation of this chapter for a cannabis consumption event organizer licensee, or a cannabis producer, processor, or retailer participating in a consumption event, to provide employment requiring a budtender permit to any person who does not hold a valid budtender permit.

## Section 4
The following acts, when performed by a validly licensed cannabis consumption event organizer or employee of a validly licensed cannabis consumption event organizer in compliance with rules adopted by the board to implement this chapter, do not constitute criminal or civil offenses under Washington state law:

1. The purchase and receipt of cannabis from a validly licensed cannabis producer under this chapter or operating in compliance with a compact entered into under RCW 43.06.490, and purchase and receipt of single-use cannabis products that have been properly packaged and labeled as cannabis products approved by the board for the preparation of ready-to-consume cannabis products, from a cannabis processor validly licensed under this chapter or operating in compliance with a compact entered into under RCW 43.06.490;

    b. The board must reconsider and increase limits on the amount of square feet permitted to be in production on July 24, 2015, and increase the percentage of production space for those cannabis producers who intend to grow plants for cannabis retailers holding medical cannabis endorsements if the cannabis producer designates the increased production space to plants determined by the department under RCW 69.50.375 to be of a THC concentration, CBD concentration, or THC to CBD ratio appropriate for cannabis concentrates, useable cannabis, or cannabis-infused products to be sold to qualifying patients.

For the purpose of considering any application for a license to produce, process, research, transport, or deliver cannabis, useable cannabis, cannabis concentrates, or cannabis-infused products subject to the regulations established under RCW 69.50.385, or sell cannabis, or allow the consumption of cannabis products, or for the renewal of a license to produce, process, research, transport, or deliver cannabis, useable cannabis, cannabis concentrates, or cannabis-infused products subject to the regulations established under RCW 69.50.385, or sell cannabis, or allow the consumption of cannabis products, the board must conduct a comprehensive, fair, and impartial evaluation of the applications timely received.

    a. The board may cause an inspection of the premises to be made, and may inquire into all matters in connection with the construction and operation of the premises. For the purpose of reviewing any application for a license and for considering the denial, suspension, revocation, cancellation, or renewal or denial thereof, of any license, the board may consider any prior criminal arrests or convictions of the applicant, any public safety administrative violation history record with the board, and a criminal history record information check. The board may submit the criminal history record information check to the Washington state patrol and to the identification division of the federal bureau of investigation in order that these agencies may search their records for prior arrests and convictions of the individual or individuals who filled out the forms. The board must require fingerprinting of any applicant whose criminal history record information check is submitted to the federal bureau of investigation. The provisions of RCW 9.95.240 and of chapter 9.96A RCW do not apply to these cases. Subject to the provisions of this section, the board may, in its discretion, grant or deny the renewal or license applied for. Denial may be based on, without limitation, the existence of chronic illegal activity documented in objections submitted pursuant to subsections (7)(c) and (10) of this section. Authority to approve an uncontested or unopposed license may be granted by the board to any staff member the board designates in writing. Conditions for granting this authority must be adopted by rule.

    b. No license of any kind may be issued to:

        i. A person under the age of 21 years;

        ii. A person doing business as a sole proprietor who has not lawfully resided in the state for at least six months prior to applying to receive a license;

        iii. A partnership, employee cooperative, association, nonprofit corporation, or corporation unless formed under the laws of this state, and unless all of the members thereof are qualified to obtain a license as provided in this section; or

        iv. A person whose place of business is conducted by a manager or agent, unless the manager or agent possesses the same qualifications required of the licensee.

    a. The board may, in its discretion, subject to RCW 43.05.160, 69.50.563, 69.50.562, 69.50.334, and 69.50.342(3) suspend or cancel any license; and all protections of the licensee from criminal or civil sanctions under state law for producing, processing, researching, or selling cannabis, cannabis concentrates, useable cannabis, or cannabis-infused products thereunder must be suspended or terminated, as the case may be.

    b. The board must immediately suspend the license of a person who has been certified pursuant to RCW 74.20A.320 by the department of social and health services as a person who is not in compliance with a support order. If the person has continued to meet all other requirements for reinstatement during the suspension, reissuance of the license is automatic upon the board's receipt of a release issued by the department of social and health services stating that the licensee is in compliance with the order.

    c. The board may request the appointment of administrative law judges under chapter 34.12 RCW who shall have power to administer oaths, issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of papers, books, accounts, documents, and testimony, examine witnesses, receive testimony in any inquiry, investigation, hearing, or proceeding in any part of the state, and consider mitigating and aggravating circumstances in any case and deviate from any prescribed penalty, under rules the board may adopt.

    d. Witnesses must be allowed fees and mileage each way to and from any inquiry, investigation, hearing, or proceeding at the rate authorized by RCW 34.05.446. Fees need not be paid in advance of appearance of witnesses to testify or to produce books, records, or other legal evidence.

    e. In case of disobedience of any person to comply with the order of the board or a subpoena issued by the board, or any of its members, or administrative law judges, or on the refusal of a witness to testify to any matter regarding which he or she may be lawfully interrogated, the judge of the superior court of the county in which the person resides, on application of any member of the board or administrative law judge, compels obedience by contempt proceedings, as in the case of disobedience of the requirements of a subpoena issued from said court or a refusal to testify therein.

3. Upon receipt of notice of the suspension or cancellation of a license, the licensee must forthwith deliver up the license to the board. Where the license has been suspended only, the board must return the license to the licensee at the expiration or termination of the period of suspension. The board must notify all other licensees in the county where the subject licensee has its premises of the suspension or cancellation of the license; and no other licensee or employee of another licensee may allow or cause any cannabis, cannabis concentrates, useable cannabis, or cannabis-infused products to be delivered to or for any person at the premises of the subject licensee.

4. Every license issued under this chapter is subject to all conditions and restrictions imposed by this chapter or by rules adopted by the board to implement and enforce this chapter. All conditions and restrictions imposed by the board in the issuance of an individual license must be listed on the face of the individual license along with the trade name, address, and expiration date.

    b. The incorporated city or town through the official or employee selected by it, the county legislative authority or the official or employee selected by it, the tribal government, or port authority has the right to file with the board within 20 days after the date of transmittal of the notice for applications, or at least 30 days prior to the expiration date for renewals, written objections against the applicant or against the premises for which the new or renewed license is asked. The board may extend the time period for submitting written objections upon request from the authority notified by the board.

    c. The written objections must include a statement of all facts upon which the objections are based, and in case written objections are filed, the city or town or county legislative authority may request, and the board may in its discretion hold, a hearing subject to the applicable provisions of Title 34 RCW. If the board makes an initial decision to deny a license or renewal based on the written objections of an incorporated city or town or county legislative authority, the applicant may request a hearing subject to the applicable provisions of Title 34 RCW. If a hearing is held at the request of the applicant, board representatives must present and defend the board's initial decision to deny a license or renewal.

    d. Upon the granting of a license under this title the board must send written notification to the chief executive officer of the incorporated city or town in which the license is granted, or to the county legislative authority if the license is granted outside the boundaries of incorporated cities or towns.

    a. Except as provided in (b) through (e) of this subsection, the board may not issue a license for any premises within 1,000 feet of the perimeter of the grounds of any elementary or secondary school, playground, recreation center or facility, child care center, public park, public transit center, or library, or any game arcade admission to which is not restricted to persons aged 21 years or older.

    b. A city, county, or town may permit the licensing of premises within 1,000 feet but not less than 100 feet of the facilities described in (a) of this subsection, except elementary schools, secondary schools, and playgrounds, by enacting an ordinance authorizing such distance reduction, provided that such distance reduction will not negatively impact the jurisdiction's civil regulatory enforcement, criminal law enforcement interests, public safety, or public health.

    c. A city, county, or town may permit the licensing of research premises allowed under RCW 69.50.372 within 1,000 feet but not less than 100 feet of the facilities described in (a) of this subsection by enacting an ordinance authorizing such distance reduction, provided that the ordinance will not negatively impact the jurisdiction's civil regulatory enforcement, criminal law enforcement, public safety, or public health.

    d. The board may license premises located in compliance with the distance requirements set in an ordinance adopted under (b) or (c) of this subsection. Before issuing or renewing a research license for premises within 1,000 feet but not less than 100 feet of an elementary school, secondary school, or playground in compliance with an ordinance passed pursuant to (c) of this subsection, the board must ensure that the facility:

        i. Meets a security standard exceeding that which applies to cannabis producer, processor, or retailer licensees;

        ii. Is inaccessible to the public and no part of the operation of the facility is in view of the general public; and

        iii. Bears no advertising or signage indicating that it is a cannabis research facility.

    e. The board must issue a certificate of compliance if the premises met the requirements under (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this subsection on the date of the application. The certificate allows the licensee to operate the business at the proposed location notwithstanding a later occurring, otherwise disqualifying factor.

    f. The board may not issue a license for any premises within Indian country, as defined in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1151, including any fee patent lands within the exterior boundaries of a reservation, without the consent of the federally recognized tribe associated with the reservation or Indian country.

9. A city, town, or county may adopt an ordinance prohibiting a cannabis producer or cannabis processor from operating or locating a business within areas zoned primarily for residential use or rural use with a minimum lot size of five acres or smaller.

10. In determining whether to grant or deny a license or renewal of any license, the board must give substantial weight to objections from an incorporated city or town or county legislative authority based upon chronic illegal activity associated with the applicant's operations of the premises proposed to be licensed or the applicant's operation of any other licensed premises, or the conduct of the applicant's patrons inside or outside the licensed premises. "Chronic illegal activity" means (a) a pervasive pattern of activity that threatens the public health, safety, and welfare of the city, town, or county including, but not limited to, open container violations, assaults, disturbances, disorderly conduct, or other criminal law violations, or as documented in crime statistics, police reports, emergency medical response data, calls for service, field data, or similar records of a law enforcement agency for the city, town, county, or any other municipal corporation or any state agency; or (b) an unreasonably high number of citations for violations of RCW 46.61.502 associated with the applicant's or licensee's operation of any licensed premises as indicated by the reported statements given to law enforcement upon arrest.

11. The board may not issue a cannabis retail license for any premises not currently licensed if:

    a. The board receives a written objection from the legislative authority of an incorporated city or town, or county legislative authority, relating to the physical location of the proposed premises;

    b. The objection to the location from the incorporated city or town, or county legislative authority, is received by the board within 20 days of the board notifying the incorporated city or town, or county legislative authority, of the proposed cannabis retail location; and

    c. The objection to the issuance of a cannabis retail license at the specified location is based on a preexisting local ordinance limiting outlet density in a specific geographic area. For purposes of this subsection (11), a preexisting local ordinance is an ordinance enacted and in effect before the date the applicant submits an application for a cannabis retail license to the board identifying the premises proposed to be licensed. No objection related to the physical location of a proposed premises may be made by a local government under this subsection (11) based on a local ordinance enacted after the date the applicant submits an application for a cannabis retail license to the board identifying the premises proposed to be licensed.

12. After January 1, 2024, all cannabis licensees are encouraged but are not required to submit a social equity plan to the board. Upon confirmation by the board that a cannabis licensee who is not a social equity applicant, and who does not hold a social equity license issued under RCW 69.50.335, has submitted a social equity plan, the board must within 30 days reimburse such a licensee an amount equal to the cost of the licensee's annual cannabis license renewal fee. The license renewal fee reimbursement authorized under this subsection is subject to the following limitations:

    a. The board may provide reimbursement one time only to any licensed entity; and

    b. Any licensed entity holding more than one cannabis license is eligible for reimbursement of the license renewal fee on only one license.
