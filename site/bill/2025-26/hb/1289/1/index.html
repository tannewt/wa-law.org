</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose of the survey is to:</p>
<ol type="a">

<p>Identify, through the collected data, opportunities for improving the public school system to better meet the needs of students and their parents or guardians.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Any board of directors may make agreements with adults choosing to attend school, and may charge the adults reasonable tuition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A district is strongly encouraged to honor the request of a parent or guardian for his or her child to attend a school in another district or the request of a parent or guardian for his or her child to transfer as a student receiving home-based instruction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A district shall release a student to a nonresident district that agrees to accept the student if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A financial, educational, safety, or health condition affecting the student would likely be reasonably improved as a result of the transfer; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attendance at the school in the nonresident district is more accessible to the parent's place of work or to the location of child care; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a special hardship or detrimental condition; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose of the transfer is for the student to enroll in an online course or online school program offered by an online provider approved under RCW 28A.250.020.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A district may deny the request of a resident student to transfer to a nonresident district if the release of the student would adversely affect the district's existing desegregation plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purpose of helping a district assess the quality of its education program, a resident school district may, in addition to providing the parent or guardian with a link to the survey required by section 1 of this act, request an optional exit interview or questionnaire with the parents or guardians of a child transferring to another district. No parent or guardian may be forced to attend such an interview or complete the questionnaire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning with the 1993-94 school year, school districts may not charge transfer fees or tuition for nonresident students enrolled under subsection (3) of this section and RCW 28A.225.225. Reimbursement of a high school district for cost of educating high school pupils of a nonhigh school district shall not be deemed a transfer fee as affecting the apportionment of current state school funds.</p>
