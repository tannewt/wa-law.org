[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1292.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature intends to provide an ongoing cost-of-living adjustment to the plans 1 of the public employees' retirement system and the teachers' retirement system and establish a new funding policy to help manage the costs of this benefit improvement while supporting employer contribution rate stability.

The 15-year financing period is intended to apply only to the consolidated cost-of-living adjustments costs. Any other plans 1 benefit improvements, including benefit improvements after the effective date of this section, shall be paid over a fixed 10-year amortization period consistent with current law funding policy.
