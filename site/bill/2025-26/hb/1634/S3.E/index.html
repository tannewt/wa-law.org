<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>According to the 2023 healthy youth survey, approximately one-quarter of Washington children and youth ages three through 17 experience mental, emotional, developmental, or behavioral problems;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prevention, early identification, early intervention, and crisis intervention for these problems improve educational outcomes, reduce involvement with the judicial system, increase long-term well-being, and reduce the public costs associated with chronic and severe behavioral health needs; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state's behavioral health system remains fragmented and does not consistently provide children and youth and their families with timely, coordinated, and effective services and supports.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The children and youth behavioral health work group adopted the &quot;Washington thriving&quot; strategic plan in November 2025, as required by RCW 74.09.4951, to transform the behavioral health system for residents from birth to age 25; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The strategic plan identifies goals that include a connected, coordinated, collaborative, accountable, and sustainable behavioral health ecosystem and the provision of coordinated, accessible, effective services and supports across a full continuum of comprehensive offerings, including services delivered where children and youth and their families spend time, such as at schools.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that school districts and public education entities already have responsibilities and infrastructure related to student behavioral health, including:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Adoption of student emotional and behavioral distress plans required of school districts under RCW 28A.320.127, including identification of staff training opportunities and partnerships with agencies and community organizations for referral of students to behavioral health services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Behavioral health coordination and related support required of the regional school safety centers under RCW 28A.310.510, including support for the development and implementation of student emotional and behavioral distress plans, suicide prevention training, and facilitation of partnerships between school districts, public schools, and behavioral health systems; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Biennial obligations to train school staff in mental health literacy, social-emotional learning, and trauma-informed practices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that school districts and public schools use a variety of structured systems to support students' readiness to learn, for example multitiered systems of support and the Washington integrated student supports protocol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Washington integrated student supports protocol, established under RCW 28A.300.139 includes student and system needs assessments, integration and coordination of academic and nonacademic supports, community partnerships, and outcome tracking.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to strengthen cross-agency coordination between public education entities and behavioral health partners so that public schools can serve as an access point for prevention, early identification, early intervention, and crisis intervention as part of a coordinated continuum of regional and statewide behavioral health services and supports for children and youth and their families.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>To support students' readiness to learn, school districts and public schools must have access to the prevention, early identification, early intervention, and crisis intervention assistance, resources, and training necessary for schools to utilize and integrate with a statewide system of coordinated care for children and youth and their families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction, including the state school safety center established in RCW 28A.300.630, and the educational service districts, including the regional school safety centers established in RCW 28A.310.510, must collaborate and coordinate with state, regional, and local agencies and community partners involved in behavioral health services for children and youth to develop a technical assistance and training framework to provide school districts and public schools with assistance in supporting student behavioral health, including identifying systems' needs, mapping resources, accessing available funding, and connecting to community-based behavioral health services and supports.</p>

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
