<li>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction shall submit to each regular session of the legislature during an odd-numbered year a programmed budget request for special education programs for students with disabilities. Funding for programs operated by local school districts shall be on an excess cost basis from appropriations provided by the legislature for special education programs for students with disabilities and shall take account of state funds accruing through RCW 28A.150.260 (4)(a), (5), (6), and (8) and 28A.150.415.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The excess cost allocation to school districts shall be based on the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A district's annual average head count enrollment of students ages three and four and those five year olds not yet enrolled in kindergarten who are eligible for and receiving special education, multiplied by the district's base allocation per full-time equivalent student, multiplied by 1.2;</p>

<li>Subject to the limitation in (b)(ii) of this subsection (2), a district's annual average enrollment of resident students who are eligible for and receiving special education, excluding students ages three and four and those five year olds not yet enrolled in kindergarten, multiplied by the district's base allocation per full-time equivalent student, multiplied by the special education cost multiplier rate of:</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Basic education enrollment&quot; means enrollment of resident students including nonresident students enrolled under RCW 28A.225.225 and students from nonhigh districts enrolled under RCW 28A.225.210 and excluding students residing in another district enrolled as part of an interdistrict cooperative program under RCW 28A.225.250.</p>

<p>Safety net funds shall be awarded by the state safety net oversight committee subject to the following conditions and limitations:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The committee shall award additional funds for districts that can convincingly demonstrate that all legitimate expenditures for special education exceed all available revenues from state funding formulas. When determining award eligibility and amounts[,] the committee shall limit its review to relevant documentation that illustrates adherence to award criteria. The committee shall not make determinations regarding the content of individualized education programs beyond confirming documented and quantified services and evidence of corresponding expenditures for which a school district seeks reimbursement.</p>

<p>In the determination of need, the committee shall consider additional available revenues from federal sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differences in program costs attributable to district philosophy, service delivery choice, or accounting practices are not a legitimate basis for safety net awards.</p>

<p>In the determination of need, the committee shall require that districts demonstrate that they are maximizing their eligibility for all state revenues related to services for students eligible for special education and all federal revenues from federal impact aid, medicaid, and the individuals with disabilities education act-Part B and appropriate special projects. Awards associated with (e) and (f) of this subsection shall not exceed the total of a district's specific determination of need.</p>

<p>The committee shall then consider the extraordinary high cost needs of one or more individual students eligible for and receiving special education. Differences in costs attributable to district philosophy, service delivery choice, or accounting practices are not a legitimate basis for safety net awards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using criteria developed by the committee, the committee shall then consider extraordinary costs associated with communities that draw a larger number of families with children in need of special education services, which may include consideration of proximity to group homes, military bases, and regional hospitals. Safety net awards under this subsection (2)(f) shall be adjusted to reflect amounts awarded under (e) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The committee shall then consider the extraordinary high cost needs of one or more individual students eligible for and receiving special education served in residential schools, programs for juveniles under the department of corrections, and programs for juveniles operated by city and county jails to the extent they are providing a secondary program of education.</p>

Before revising any standards, procedures, or rules, the superintendent shall consult with the office of financial management and the fiscal committees of the legislature. In adopting and revising the rules, the superintendent shall ensure the application process to access safety net funding is streamlined, timelines for submission are not in conflict, feedback to school districts is timely and provides sufficient information to allow school districts to understand how to correct any deficiencies in a safety net application, and that there is consistency between awards approved by school district and by application period.

<p>By December 1, 2024, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must develop a survey requesting specific feedback on the safety net application process from school districts with 3,000 or fewer students. The survey must include, at a minimum, questions regarding the average amount of time school district staff spend gathering safety net application data, filling out application forms, and correcting application deficiencies. The survey must also include questions to help identify which application components are the most challenging and time consuming for school districts to complete. By December 1, 2025, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must use this feedback to implement a simplified, standardized safety net application for all school districts that reduces barriers to safety net funding.</p>

<p>The omnibus operating appropriations act, chapter 475, Laws of 2023, appropriated funding to the office of the superintendent of public instruction for two-year demonstration projects that build school-wide systems to support students in distress and prevent crisis escalation cycles that may result in restraint or isolation. In accordance with the legislation, the office of the superintendent of public instruction established demonstration projects with demonstration sites and pilot sites.</p>

<li>
<p>Six demonstration sites were selected to showcase best practices and to serve as learning communities and examples that would allow other school districts to observe positive practices in real-world settings. Sixteen pilot sites were selected to engage in targeted professional development, including in inclusionary practices, through learning experiences offered by the demonstration sites and state contracted professional development providers, as well as complete other tasks to achieve the project's goal.</p>

<p>The demonstration sites receiving grants under this subsection must showcase the following practices: Staff use of inclusive teaching practices and student behavior management practices; staff knowledge and support of district policies; student and school needs assessments; use of regulation spaces for students; and data collection and reporting related to disruptive student behavioral incidents. The demonstration sites must continue to serve as learning communities and examples that allow other school districts, not only the pilot sites, to observe positive practices in real-world settings.</p>

<p>The pilot sites receiving grants under this subsection must take advantage of learning experiences provided by state contractors and demonstration sites to build school-level and district-level systems that incorporate positive, inclusive, student behavior management practices to prevent crisis escalation and reduce disruptive behavioral incidents, with particular focus on students with disabilities.

The report must, to the extent possible, quantify the impact of the demonstration projects in terms of student outcomes, such as changes in disruptive student behavior, increases in the amount of time students with disabilities spend in the general education setting, or increases in assessment scores. The report must include an estimate of the fiscal impact that use of the practices identified in subsection (2)(b) of this section might have on school district budgets if adopted statewide. The report must also address key implementation challenges and findings, as well as include recommendations for statewide policy changes.</p>
