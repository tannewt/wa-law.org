# HB 1071 - Recycling rates

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1071-S.pdf)

## Section 101
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. Washington state has been a leader in recycling policy, reaching the goal of 50 percent recycling set by the legislature in RCW 70A.205.005. The legislature further finds that, since meeting the state's goal to achieve a 50 percent recycling rate, global market conditions have caused the recycling rate to fall below 50 percent, demonstrating the dependence of recycling rates on reliable, consistent recycling markets for recyclable materials;

    b. New goals and target recycling rates must be established and a comprehensive needs assessment is necessary to implement improvements to Washington's existing recycling system to reach those goals;

    c. Programs, activities, or projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the solid waste sector, including a comprehensive needs assessment, are intended to be funded from the climate commitment account;

    d. 88 percent of Washington residents living in single-family homes and 77 percent living in multifamily residences have access to curbside recycling services through a robust regulatory structure that ensures equal access to services at affordable rates; and

    e. The investments in infrastructure by Washington companies has led to the development of materials sorting and processing superior to most other states.

2. [Empty]

    a. The legislature finds that contamination in the recycling stream is a major impediment to higher recovery rates.

    b. It is the intent of the legislature to implement proven strategies to address these challenges, including:

        i. The establishment of a single statewide list of materials for recyclables collected through Washington's curbside recycling system to reduce confusion and increase participation;

        ii. A robust needs assessment unique to Washington state to determine costs and investments necessary to achieve a 65 percent overall recycling rate for packaging;

        iii. Study the use of recycling symbols on packaging that cannot be readily recycled through Washington's recycling system; and

        iv. The expansion of the successful recycled content requirements to ensure more materials are manufactured with postconsumer material.

3. It is the intent of the legislature that:

    a. Producers increase the use of postconsumer recycled content in their products, to achieve the goals in RCW 70A.520.010(2) and to create strong markets for recycled materials and achieve environmental benefits; and

    b. Through design and innovation, producers will reduce the use and climate impact of consumer packaging and paper products and increase the use of postconsumer recycled content.

4. Finally, it is the intent of the legislature that Washington should maintain the successful public-private partnership between state, local government, and solid waste and recycling service providers. The legislature does not intend to diminish or displace the primary role of the utilities and transportation commission and local governments in regulating or contracting directly with service providers for the curbside collection of residential recyclables. Local governments maintain their existing authority to collect, contract for collection with solid waste and recycling service providers, or defer to solid waste collection services regulated by the utilities and transportation commission.

5. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to implement proven strategies to address these challenges, including:

    a. A robust needs assessment unique to Washington state to determine costs and investments necessary to achieve a 65 percent overall recycling rate for packaging; and

    b. The expansion of the successful recycled content requirements to ensure more materials are manufactured with postconsumer material.

## Section 401
1. Upon its own motion, or upon request by a solid waste collection company or a county, the commission may approve rates, charges, or services at a discount for low-income senior customers and low-income customers. Expenses and lost revenues as a result of these discounts must be included in the company's cost of service and recovered in rates to other customers.

2. In order to remove barriers and to expedite assistance, low-income discounts approved under this section must be provided in coordination with community-based organizations in the solid waste collection company's service territory including, but not limited to, city and county government, grantees of the department of commerce, community action agencies, and community-based nonprofit organizations. Nothing in this section may be construed as limiting the commission's authority to approve or modify tariffs authorizing low-income discounts.

3. Eligibility for a low-income discount rate established in this section must be established upon verification of a low-income customer's receipt of any means-tested public benefit by an organization identified in subsection (2) of this section, for which eligibility does not exceed the low-income definition set by the commission pursuant to RCW 19.405.020. The public benefits may include, but are not limited to, assistance that provides cash, housing, food, or medical care including, but not limited to, temporary assistance for needy families, supplemental security income, emergency assistance to elders, disabled, and children, supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits, public housing, federally subsidized or state-subsidized housing, the low-income home energy assistance program, veterans' benefits, and similar benefits.

4. Each solid waste collection company that offers a low-income discount shall conduct outreach efforts to make the low-income discounts available to eligible customers. Such outreach:

    a. Must be made at least biannually to inform customers of available rebates, discounts, credits, and other cost-saving mechanisms that can help them lower their monthly bills for solid waste collection service; and

    b. May be in the form of any customary and usual methods of communication or distribution including, without limitation, widely broadcast communications with customers, direct mailing, telephone calls, electronic communications, social media postings, in-person contacts, websites of the solid waste collection company, press releases, and print and electronic media, that are designed to increase access to and participation in bill assistance programs.

5. Outreach may include establishing an automated program of matching customer accounts with lists of recipients of the means-tested public benefit programs and, based on the results of the matching program, to presumptively offer a low-income discount rate to eligible customers so identified. However, the solid waste collection company must within 60 days of the presumptive enrollment inform such a low-income customer of the presumptive enrollment and all rights and obligations of a customer under the program, including the right to withdraw from the program without penalty.

6. A residential customer eligible for a low-income discount rate must receive the service on demand.

7. A residential customer may not be charged for initiating or terminating low-income discount rates.

8. A solid waste collection company is not required to make eligibility determinations for low-income rates.
