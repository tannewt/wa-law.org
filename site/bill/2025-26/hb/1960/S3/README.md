The disclosure may occur only when the person under investigation and the person in possession of data, materials, or documents are parties to the return or tax information to be disclosed. The department may disclose return or tax information such as invoices, contracts, bills, statements, resale or exemption certificates, or checks. However, the department may not disclose general ledgers, sales or cash receipt journals, check registers, accounts receivable/payable ledgers, general journals, financial statements, expert's workpapers, income tax returns, state tax returns, tax return workpapers, or other similar data, materials, or documents.

    b. Before disclosure of any tax return or tax information under this subsection (4), the department must, through written correspondence, inform the person in possession of the data, materials, or documents to be disclosed. The correspondence must clearly identify the data, materials, or documents to be disclosed. The department may not disclose any tax return or tax information under this subsection (4) until the time period allowed in (c) of this subsection has expired or until the court has ruled on any challenge brought under (c) of this subsection.

    c. The person in possession of the data, materials, or documents to be disclosed by the department has twenty days from the receipt of the written request required under (b) of this subsection to petition the superior court of the county in which the petitioner resides for injunctive relief. The court must limit or deny the request of the department if the court determines that:

        i. The data, materials, or documents sought for disclosure are cumulative or duplicative, or are obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive;

        ii. The production of the data, materials, or documents sought would be unduly burdensome or expensive, taking into account the needs of the department, the amount in controversy, limitations on the petitioner's resources, and the importance of the issues at stake; or

        iii. The data, materials, or documents sought for disclosure contain trade secret information that, if disclosed, could harm the petitioner.

    d. The department must reimburse reasonable expenses for the production of data, materials, or documents incurred by the person in possession of the data, materials, or documents to be disclosed.

    e. Requesting information under (b) of this subsection that may indicate that a taxpayer is under investigation does not constitute a disclosure of tax return or tax information under this section.

5. Service of a subpoena issued under RCW 82.32.117 does not constitute a disclosure of return or tax information under this section. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this section, a person served with a subpoena under RCW 82.32.117 may disclose the existence or content of the subpoena to that person's legal counsel.

6.

## Section 116
The local investment distribution account is created in the state treasury. All receipts from the state renewable energy excise tax imposed by section 103 of this act must be deposited into the account. Expenditures from the account may be used for the local investment distributions contained in sections 202 and 203 of this act.

## Section 201
It is the intent of the legislature to create favorable conditions that result in investments in communities hosting renewable energy project development. Encouraging such developments, including by increasing revenues for local governments, will help achieve state clean energy goals under the clean energy transformation act, achieve energy reliability and affordability, and ensure that the economic benefits of these projects accrue to the benefit of the local community.

## Section 202
1. The department shall establish the renewable energy development local investment distribution program.

    a. Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this purpose, the department must provide funds through the program to each county that hosts a qualifying energy project under this section. The total distribution under this subsection must be in a proportion equal to the amount of state excise tax under section 103 of this act attributable to a county during the previous tax reporting period.

    b. [Empty]

        i. Except for a rural county as defined in RCW 82.14.370, each county must distribute funds received from the department to the local taxing districts within the county in which each qualifying energy project is located, according to the taxing district's relative share of the local property tax levy.

        ii. For distributions for qualifying energy projects in a rural county, as defined in RCW 82.14.370, the rural county may elect to retain the full amount provided by the department, without distribution to local taxing districts.

2. [Empty]

    a. In order for a county to be eligible to receive funds in a proportion equal to the amount of state excise tax under section 103 of this act attributable to a county, the department must determine that:

        i. The qualifying energy project is located in the county, and the project was operating before January 1, 2029; or

        ii. The qualifying energy project is located in the county, and the county has adopted or substantially adopted the model ordinance published by the department under section 203 of this act. For the purposes of this section, "substantially adopted" means, in the opinion of the department, the county has adopted development regulations that achieve the intent of the model ordinance published by the department, are not more restrictive or burdensome than the model ordinance, and do not unnecessarily impede the development of renewable energy projects within the county.

    b. In order for a county to be determined to be eligible to receive funds under this subsection (2) for a project that applies to and completes the county's process for development approval and files an environmental policy checklist pursuant to chapter 43.21C RCW after the effective date of this section, a county must include in its development regulations that:

        i. A qualifying energy project developer must:

(A) Initiate and document the offer to conduct early and meaningful engagement, before the submission of an environmental policy checklist under chapter 43.21C RCW, related to the qualifying energy project with each federally recognized Indian tribe within whose ceded territory and usual and accustomed area the qualifying energy project is proposed to be located in a manner that recognizes the sovereignty and legal rights of the tribe, with the objective of agreeing on a plan for protecting the archaeological and cultural resources that are potentially affected by the project;

(B) Notify, and offer to meet with, the department of archaeology and historic preservation regarding the geographical location, detailed scope of the proposed project, preliminary application details available to federal, state, or local jurisdictions, and all publicly available materials, with the objective of agreeing on a plan for protecting the archaeological and cultural resources that are potentially affected by the project; and

(C) Survey the proposed project site in a manner that reflects input solicited from the department of archaeology and historic preservation and each federally recognized Indian tribe whose lands described in this section are impacted, if any such input is received by the project developer within 60 days of the notification in (b)(i)(B) of this subsection (2); and

        ii. The county may condition an application by a qualifying energy project developer in accordance with a plan agreement between the qualifying energy project developer and either the federally recognized Indian tribe or the department of archaeology and historic preservation, or both, for protecting the archaeological cultural resources that are potentially affected by the project.

3. A qualifying energy project may be eligible under this section if the project has received applicable permits under the energy facility site evaluation council process established in chapter 80.50 RCW, the clean energy coordinated permit process pursuant to RCW 43.394.020, or through permit processes overseen by the city or county.

4. [Empty]

    a. The department must establish an application process for the program.

    b. The department may charge a reasonable fee for administrative costs. Fees must be deposited in the local investment distribution account created in section 116 of this act.

5. Beginning in fiscal year 2029, the legislature intends to dedicate at least 75 percent of the local investment distribution account appropriations each biennium to the funding of the local investment distribution program described in this section. It is the intent of the legislature to apply any balance in the local investment distribution account that is in excess of the eligible expenses for the local investment distribution program under this section first to the tribal capacity grant program in section 204 of this act in amount not to exceed a total of $21,500,000 each biennium and second to the general fund.

6. Nothing in this section limits the authority of a county or city to administratively object to or legally appeal a qualifying energy project or component thereof or to be eligible for grant funds under this section if they file such an objection or appeal.

7. For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:

    a. [Empty]

        i. "Energy storage system" means commercially available technology that is capable of retaining electricity, storing the energy for a period of time, and delivering the electricity after storage by chemical, thermal, mechanical, or other means.

        ii. "Energy storage system" does not include a solar or wind energy production facility.

    b. "Qualifying energy project" means an energy storage system, a wind or solar energy production facility, associated facilities, or any combination thereof, constructed after the effective date of this section.

## Section 203
1. [Empty]

    a. The department shall provide technical assistance and ongoing liaison support to local governments, including methods and best practices for siting qualifying energy projects specified in section 202 of this act, for use by local governments.
