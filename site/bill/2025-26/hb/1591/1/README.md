[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1591.pdf)

## Section 1
1. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the court may reduce any term of incarceration or other criminal penalties under this chapter or impose available alternatives as provided under subsection (2) of this section when sentencing any defendant for one or more crimes where: At the time of the offense, the defendant was a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or human trafficking, and subjected to substantial physical, sexual, or psychological abuse inflicted by an intimate partner or family or household member; the domestic violence or abuse suffered by the defendant was a significant contributing factor to the defendant's criminal conduct; and the generally applicable sentencing requirements under this chapter would be unduly harsh given the nature and circumstances of the crime and the history, character, and condition of the defendant.

2. [Empty]

    a. Prior to reducing a term of incarceration or imposing alternatives under this section, the court shall make findings as to whether the defendant qualifies under this section. The court may determine a defendant qualifies under this section regardless of whether the defendant previously raised any defense related to the domestic violence or abuse.

    b. The court may consider the following when making its finding as to whether the domestic violence or abuse suffered by the defendant was a significant contributing factor to his or her criminal conduct: Whether the defendant is being sentenced for a crime against an intimate partner who committed domestic violence against the defendant; whether, at any point in time, the defendant has been diagnosed with or treated for any behavioral health condition related to prior victimization; evidence that the defendant's prior victimization has affected how the defendant perceives their safety and security; evidence that the defendant's prior victimization has affected how the defendant perceives their ability to receive help through law enforcement or other government entities; evidence that the defendant's prior victimization has limited the defendant's ability to achieve financial independence; and any other factors deemed relevant by the court.

    c. In making findings under this section, the court may consider any of the following: Oral and written arguments; a written statement from the defendant; testimony from the defendant or from witnesses offered by either party; written statements from third parties regarding whether the defendant is a survivor of domestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, or stalking including, but not limited to, statements from a mental health or victim service provider or school administrator or teacher; medical records and documents; physical evidence; copies of restraining, antiharassment, or protection orders; police reports; recordings of 911 calls; expert testimony; and any other relevant evidence.

3. If the court finds that a defendant qualifies under this section, the court may, in its discretion:

    a. Impose a sentence below the standard range under RCW 9.94A.510, and below any mandatory minimum terms under RCW 9.94A.540 and 9.94A.570;

    b. Depart downward from any sentencing enhancements under RCW 9.94A.533; or

    c. Impose the sentencing alternative under section 2 of this act.

4. Nothing in this section modifies the authority of the court to impose any other available sentencing alternatives for a qualifying defendant including, but not limited to, alternatives under RCW 9.94A.650, 9.94A.655, 9.94A.660, 9.94A.670, or 9.94A.711.

5. Defendants sentenced for offenses under any of the following are not eligible for alternative sentencing under this act: RCW 10.95.020 (aggravated first degree murder); RCW 9A.32.030 (first degree murder); RCW 9A.32.055 (homicide by abuse; minors and dependent adults); an offense committed with intent to commit a terrorist act under chapter 70.74 RCW; any offense requiring sex offender registration under chapter 9A.44 RCW; and attempt or conspiracy to commit any of the foregoing.

6. For the purposes of this section, "family or household member" and "intimate partner" have the same meanings as provided in RCW 10.99.020.

## Section 2
1. A person is eligible for the sentencing alternative under this section if the court finds that he or she meets the criteria under section 1 of this act. To assist the court in determining whether the alternative is appropriate for the defendant, the court may order the department to complete a risk assessment report or a chemical dependency screening report as provided in RCW 9.94A.500.

2. If the sentencing court determines that the person is eligible for the sentencing alternative under this section and that the sentencing alternative is appropriate and should be imposed, the court shall waive the sentence within the standard sentence range and any applicable enhancements, and instead impose: A reduced term of confinement with an extended term of community custody, as determined by the court; or waive the term of confinement and impose an extended term of community custody. The court has complete discretion to determine the term of incarceration and community custody, provided that the combined length of both does not exceed the standard range and enhancements applicable to the underlying crime or crimes for which the defendant has been convicted. For the term of community custody, the court may impose conditions as provided in RCW 9.94A.703 and may impose other affirmative conditions as the court considers appropriate, and the department may impose conditions and sanctions as authorized in RCW 9.94A.704 and 9.94A.737.

3. For any person serving a term of community custody under this section:

    a. The department shall report to the court if the person commits any violations of the conditions imposed by the court or the department;

    b. The court may order the person to report to court at any time during the period of community custody in order to evaluate the person's compliance or progress with his or her conditions, or to determine if any violations of the conditions have occurred;

    c. The court may modify the conditions of community custody or impose sanctions for violations, including extending the term of community custody; and

    d. The court may order the person to serve a term of total confinement within the standard range for the offense at any time during the period of community custody, if the person violates the conditions or requirements of the sentence.

## Section 3
1. [Empty]

    a. Any person who is currently incarcerated and serving a sentence of at least eight years imposed prior to the effective date of this section may petition the sentencing court for resentencing on the basis that he or she meets the requirements described in section 1(1) of this act. A petition must include at least two pieces of evidence corroborating the applicant's claim of eligibility:

        i. At least one piece of evidence must be either a court record, presentence report, social services record, hospital record, sworn statement from a witness to the domestic violence or abuse, law enforcement record, domestic incident report, or order of protection.

        ii. Other evidence may include, but shall not be limited to, local and state department of corrections or other corrections records, a showing based in part on documentation prepared at or near the time of the commission of the offense or the prosecution thereof tending to support the person's claim, or verification of consultation with a licensed medical or mental health care provider, employee of a court acting within the scope of his or her employment, member of the clergy, attorney, social worker, or other advocate acting on behalf of an agency that assists victims of domestic violence for the purpose of assisting such person with domestic violence victim counseling or support.

2. The court may deny a petition for resentencing without a hearing and must notify the person and dismiss the petition without prejudice. If the court orders a hearing on the petition, the court may receive testimony and evidence as provided under section 1(2) of this act.

    a. The court may consider any fact or circumstances relevant to the imposition of a new sentence which are submitted by the petitioner or the prosecuting attorney, including the petitioner's record of confinement.

    b. The court's consideration of the individual's record of confinement shall include, but not be limited to, such applicant's participation in or willingness to participate in programming concerning domestic violence, parenting and substance abuse treatment while incarcerated, and the applicant's disciplinary history. The fact that the applicant may have been unable to participate in treatment or other programming while incarcerated despite such applicant's willingness to do so shall not be considered a negative factor in making a determination on a petition pursuant to this section.

    c. If the court grants a petition, the court may resentence the person in accordance with sections 1 and 2 of this act, provided that any new sentence may not be greater than the initial sentence.

    d. If the court determines that the applicant should not be resentenced in accordance with this act, the court shall inform such petitioner and shall enter an order to that effect. Any order issued by a court pursuant to this section must include written findings of fact and the reasons for such order.

3. If a hearing on a petition is scheduled pursuant to this section, the prosecuting attorney shall make reasonable efforts to notify victims and survivors of victims of the petition and the date of hearing. The prosecuting attorney shall provide victims and survivors of victims access to available victim advocates and other related services. The court shall provide an opportunity for victims and survivors of victims of any crimes for which the defendant has been convicted to present a statement personally or by representation. The prosecuting attorney and the court shall comply with the requirements set forth in chapter 7.69 RCW.

4. A petition filed under this section does not reopen the defendant's conviction to challenges that would otherwise be barred.

5. [Empty]

    a. An appeal may be taken as of right in accordance with applicable provisions of this act:

        i. From an order denying resentencing; or

        ii. From a new sentence imposed under this provision.

    b. An appeal may be based on the grounds that:

        i. The term of the new sentence is harsh or excessive; or

        ii. The term of the new sentence is unauthorized as a matter of law.

    c. Upon remand to the sentencing court following such appeal the applicant shall be given an opportunity to withdraw an application for resentencing before any resentence is imposed.

2. For persons convicted of the anticipatory offenses of criminal attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy under chapter 9A.28 RCW, the standard sentence range is determined by locating the sentencing grid sentence range defined by the appropriate offender score and the seriousness level of the completed crime, and multiplying the range by seventy-five percent.

These enhancements shall be mandatory, shall be served in total confinement, and shall run consecutively to all other sentencing provisions, including other minor child enhancements, for all offenses sentenced under this chapter.

The court may impose a sentence outside the standard sentence range for an offense if it finds, considering the purpose of this chapter, that there are substantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional sentence. Facts supporting aggravated sentences, other than the fact of a prior conviction, shall be determined pursuant to the provisions of RCW 9.94A.537.

Whenever a sentence outside the standard sentence range is imposed, the court shall set forth the reasons for its decision in written findings of fact and conclusions of law. A sentence outside the standard sentence range shall be a determinate sentence.

If the sentencing court finds that an exceptional sentence outside the standard sentence range should be imposed, the sentence is subject to review only as provided for in RCW 9.94A.585(4).

A departure from the standards in RCW 9.94A.589 (1) and (2) governing whether sentences are to be served consecutively or concurrently is an exceptional sentence subject to the limitations in this section, and may be appealed by the offender or the state as set forth in RCW 9.94A.585 (2) through (6).

1. Mitigating Circumstances - Court to Consider

The court may impose an exceptional sentence below the standard range if it finds that mitigating circumstances are established by a preponderance of the evidence. The following are illustrative only and are not intended to be exclusive reasons for exceptional sentences.

    a. To a significant degree, the victim was an initiator, willing participant, aggressor, or provoker of the incident.

    b. Before detection, the defendant compensated, or made a good faith effort to compensate, the victim of the criminal conduct for any damage or injury sustained.

    c. The defendant committed the crime under duress, coercion, threat, or compulsion insufficient to constitute a complete defense but which significantly affected his or her conduct.

    d. The defendant, with no apparent predisposition to do so, was induced by others to participate in the crime.

    e. The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his or her conduct, or to conform his or her conduct to the requirements of the law, was significantly impaired. Voluntary use of drugs or alcohol is excluded.

    f. The offense was principally accomplished by another person and the defendant manifested extreme caution or sincere concern for the safety or well-being of the victim.

    g. The operation of the multiple offense policy of RCW 9.94A.589 results in a presumptive sentence that is clearly excessive in light of the purpose of this chapter, as expressed in RCW 9.94A.010.

    h. The defendant or the defendant's children suffered a continuing pattern of physical or sexual abuse by the victim of the offense and the offense is a response to that abuse.

        i. The defendant was making a good faith effort to obtain or provide medical assistance for someone who is experiencing a drug-related overdose.

    j. The current offense involved domestic violence, as defined in RCW 10.99.020, and the defendant suffered a continuing pattern of coercion, control, or abuse by the victim of the offense and the offense is a response to that coercion, control, or abuse.

    k. The defendant was convicted of vehicular homicide, by the operation of a vehicle in a reckless manner and has committed no other previous serious traffic offenses as defined in RCW 9.94A.030, and the sentence is clearly excessive in light of the purpose of this chapter, as expressed in RCW 9.94A.010.

    l. The defendant was a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or human trafficking at the time of the offense, subjected to substantial physical, sexual, or psychological abuse inflicted by an intimate partner or family or household member, the domestic violence or abuse was a significant contributing factor to the defendant's criminal conduct, and the sentence would be unduly harsh given the nature and circumstances of the crime and the history, character, and condition of the defendant.

2. Aggravating Circumstances - Considered and Imposed by the Court

The trial court may impose an aggravated exceptional sentence without a finding of fact by a jury under the following circumstances:

    a. The defendant and the state both stipulate that justice is best served by the imposition of an exceptional sentence outside the standard range, and the court finds the exceptional sentence to be consistent with and in furtherance of the interests of justice and the purposes of the sentencing reform act.

    b. The defendant's prior unscored misdemeanor or prior unscored foreign criminal history results in a presumptive sentence that is clearly too lenient in light of the purpose of this chapter, as expressed in RCW 9.94A.010.

    c. The defendant has committed multiple current offenses and the defendant's high offender score results in some of the current offenses going unpunished.

    d. The failure to consider the defendant's prior criminal history which was omitted from the offender score calculation pursuant to RCW 9.94A.525 results in a presumptive sentence that is clearly too lenient.

3. Aggravating Circumstances - Considered by a Jury - Imposed by the Court

Except for circumstances listed in subsection (2) of this section, the following circumstances are an exclusive list of factors that can support a sentence above the standard range. Such facts should be determined by procedures specified in RCW 9.94A.537.

    w. The defendant committed the offense against a victim who was acting as a good samaritan.

    x. The defendant committed the offense against a public official or officer of the court in retaliation of the public official's performance of his or her duty to the criminal justice system.

    y. The victim's injuries substantially exceed the level of bodily harm necessary to satisfy the elements of the offense. This aggravator is not an exception to RCW 9.94A.530(2).

2. In considering an application under this section, the court may consider the factors specified in section 1(2)(b) of this act and any evidence offered by the applicant, the prosecutor, and third parties including, but not limited to, those specified in section 1(2)(c) of this act; however, the court, in its discretion, may rely solely upon the sworn testimony of the applicant at a hearing before the court when granting an application under this section.

3. If the court finds that an applicant qualifies under this section, the court may, in the interest of justice, waive the restrictions under RCW 9.94A.640(2) and vacate the conviction according to the process provided in RCW 9.94A.640(1).

4. For the purposes of this section, "intimate partner" and "family or household member" have the same meanings as provided in RCW 10.99.020.

## Section 11
1. Every offender who has been discharged under RCW 9.94A.637 may apply to the sentencing court for a vacation of the offender's record of conviction. If the court finds the offender meets the tests prescribed in subsection (2) of this section or section 10 of this act, the court may clear the record of conviction by: (a) Permitting the offender to withdraw the offender's plea of guilty and to enter a plea of not guilty; or (b) if the offender has been convicted after a plea of not guilty, by the court setting aside the verdict of guilty; and (c) by the court dismissing the information or indictment against the offender.

2. Except as provided under section 10 of this act, an offender may not have the record of conviction cleared if:

    a. There are any criminal charges against the offender pending in any court of this state or another state, or in any federal court;

    b.

3. If the applicant is a victim of sex trafficking, prostitution, or commercial sexual abuse of a minor; sexual assault; or domestic violence as defined in RCW 9.94A.030, the victim or the prosecutor of the county in which the victim was sentenced may apply to the sentencing court or the sentencing court's successor to vacate the victim's record of conviction for a class B or class C felony offense using the process in RCW 9.94A.648. When preparing or filing the petition, the prosecutor is not deemed to be providing legal advice or legal assistance on behalf of the victim, but is fulfilling an administrative function on behalf of the state in order to further their responsibility to seek to reform and improve the administration of criminal justice. A record of conviction vacated using the process in RCW 9.94A.648 is subject to subsection (4) of this section.

4. [Empty]

    a. Except as otherwise provided, once the court vacates a record of conviction under subsection (1) of this section, the fact that the offender has been convicted of the offense shall not be included in the offender's criminal history for purposes of determining a sentence in any subsequent conviction, and the offender shall be released from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the offense. For all purposes, including responding to questions on employment applications, an offender whose conviction has been vacated may state that the offender has never been convicted of that crime. A conviction that has been vacated under this section may not be disseminated or disclosed by the state patrol or local law enforcement agency to any person, except other criminal justice enforcement agencies. Nothing in this section affects or prevents the use of an offender's prior conviction in a later criminal prosecution, and nothing in this section affects the requirements for restoring a right to possess a firearm under RCW 9.41.040.

    b. A conviction vacated on or after July 28, 2019, qualifies as a prior conviction for the purpose of charging a present recidivist offense occurring on or after July 28, 2019, and may be used to establish an ongoing pattern of abuse for purposes of RCW 9.94A.535.

## Section 12
1. Any person who has completed the conditions of his or her sentence may apply to the sentencing court for a vacation of his or her record of conviction for an offense occurring prior to the effective date of this section on the basis that: At the time of the offense, the person was a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or human trafficking, subjected to substantial physical, sexual, or psychological abuse inflicted by an intimate partner or family or household member; the domestic violence or abuse suffered by the person was a significant contributing factor to the defendant's criminal conduct; and the collateral consequences of the record of conviction create an unduly harsh burden on the person given the nature and circumstances of the offense and the personal history, character, and condition of the individual.

2. In considering an application under this section, the court may consider the factors specified in section 1(2)(b) of this act. The court may consider any evidence offered by the defendant, the prosecutor, and third parties including, but not limited to, the types specified in section 1(2)(c) of this act; however, the court, in its discretion, may rely solely upon the sworn testimony of the applicant at a hearing before the court when granting an application under this section.

2. Every person convicted of a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor offense may apply to the sentencing court for a vacation of the applicant's record of conviction for the offense.

    a. The applicant has not completed all of the terms of the sentence for the offense, including satisfaction of financial obligations;

    b. There are any criminal charges against the applicant pending in any court of this state or another state, or in any federal or tribal court, at the time of application;

    e. The offense was any misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor violation, including attempt, of chapter 9.68 RCW (obscenity and pornography), chapter 9.68A RCW (sexual exploitation of children), or chapter 9A.44 RCW (sex offenses), except for failure to register as a sex offender under RCW 9A.44.132;

    f. The applicant was convicted of a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor offense as defined in RCW 10.99.020, or the court determines after a review of the court file that the offense was committed by one family or household member against another or by one intimate partner against another, or the court, after considering the damage to person or property that resulted in the conviction, any prior convictions for crimes defined in RCW 10.99.020, or for comparable offenses in another state or in federal court, and the totality of the records under review by the court regarding the conviction being considered for vacation, determines that the offense involved domestic violence, and any one of the following factors exist:

        i. The applicant has not provided written notification of the vacation petition to the prosecuting attorney's office that prosecuted the offense for which vacation is sought, or has not provided that notification to the court;

3. If the applicant is a victim of sex trafficking, prostitution, or commercial sexual abuse of a minor; sexual assault; or domestic violence as defined in RCW 9.94A.030, or the prosecutor applies on behalf of the state, the sentencing court may vacate the record of conviction if the application satisfies the requirements of RCW 9.96.080. When preparing or filing the petition, the prosecutor is not deemed to be providing legal advice or legal assistance on behalf of the victim, but is fulfilling an administrative function on behalf of the state in order to further their responsibility to seek to reform and improve the administration of criminal justice. A record of conviction vacated using the process in RCW 9.96.080 is subject to subsections (7) and (8) of this section.

    a. The applicant is a member of a tribe that may exercise treaty Indian fishing rights at the location where the offense occurred; and

    b. The state has been enjoined from taking enforcement action of the statute or rule to the extent that it interferes with a treaty Indian fishing right as determined under , 384 F. Supp. 312 (W.D. Wash. 1974), or , 302 F. Supp. 899 (D. Oregon 1969), and any posttrial orders of those courts, or any other state supreme court or federal court decision.

7. A person who is a family member of a homicide victim may apply to the sentencing court on the behalf of the victim for vacation of the victim's record of conviction for prostitution under RCW 9A.88.030.

8. [Empty]

    a. Except as provided in (c) of this subsection, once the court vacates a record of conviction under this section, the person shall be released from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the offense and the fact that the person has been convicted of the offense shall not be included in the person's criminal history for purposes of determining a sentence in any subsequent conviction. For all purposes, including responding to questions on employment or housing applications, a person whose conviction has been vacated under this section may state that he or she has never been convicted of that crime. However, nothing in this section affects the requirements for restoring a right to possess a firearm under RCW 9.41.041. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, nothing in this section affects or prevents the use of an offender's prior conviction in a later criminal prosecution.

    b. When a court vacates a record of domestic violence as defined in RCW 10.99.020 under this section, the state may not use the vacated conviction in a later criminal prosecution unless the conviction was for: (i) Violating the provisions of a restraining order, no-contact order, or protection order restraining or enjoining the person or restraining the person from going on to the grounds of or entering a residence, workplace, school, or day care, or prohibiting the person from knowingly coming within, or knowingly remaining within, a specified distance of a location, a protected party's person, or a protected party's vehicle (RCW 10.99.040, 10.99.050, 26.09.300, 26.26B.050, 26.44.063, 26.44.150, or 26.52.070, or any of the former RCW 26.50.060, 26.50.070, 26.50.130, and 74.34.145); (ii) stalking (RCW 9A.46.110); or (iii) a domestic violence protection order or vulnerable adult protection order entered under chapter 7.105 RCW. A vacated conviction under this section is not considered a conviction of such an offense for the purposes of 27 C.F.R. 478.11.

    c. A conviction vacated on or after July 28, 2019, qualifies as a prior conviction for the purpose of charging a present recidivist offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030 occurring on or after July 28, 2019.

9. The clerk of the court in which the vacation order is entered shall immediately transmit the order vacating the conviction to the Washington state patrol identification section and to the local police agency, if any, which holds criminal history information for the person who is the subject of the conviction. The Washington state patrol and any such local police agency shall immediately update their records to reflect the vacation of the conviction, and shall transmit the order vacating the conviction to the federal bureau of investigation. A conviction that has been vacated under this section may not be disseminated or disclosed by the state patrol or local law enforcement agency to any person, except other criminal justice enforcement agencies.

10. For the purposes of this section, "cannabis" has the meaning provided in RCW 69.50.101.
