    b. For the purposes of collective bargaining under this section, an employee is considered enrolled in an academic or certificate program during campus academic breaks, including any winter, spring, or summer break, if the employee is employed by an institution of higher education covered by (a) of this subsection over the course of the campus academic break and is enrolled in an academic or certificate program on any campus of the institution of higher education in the quarter or semester immediately preceding, or subsequent to, the campus academic break.

    c. [Empty]

        i. For the purposes of this section, "employee" does not include employees eligible for collective bargaining under RCW 41.56.021, 41.56.0215, 41.56.022, 41.56.024, 41.56.203, or 41.56.205 or chapter 28B.52, 41.76, or 41.80 RCW.

3. [Empty]

    a. The scope of bargaining for employees under this section excludes:

        i. The ability to terminate the employment of any individual if the individual is not meeting academic requirements as determined by Central Washington University, Eastern Washington University, Western Washington University, and The Evergreen State College;
