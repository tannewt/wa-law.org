<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that agricultural workers have been harmed by the lack of a seasonality exception to overtime pay rules. Agricultural workers across the state are earning less money during peak harvest seasons because agricultural employers are capping hours worked to comply with overtime limitations imposed by the legislature in recent years. The purpose of this legislation is to give individual agricultural workers the opportunity, at their discretion, to increase their hours and compensation during peak harvest seasons.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in this section, no employer shall employ any of his or her employees for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such employee receives compensation for his or her employment in excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he or she is employed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not apply to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Any person exempted pursuant to RCW 49.46.010(3). The payment of compensation or provision of compensatory time off in addition to a salary shall not be a factor in determining whether a person is exempted under RCW 49.46.010(3)(c);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Employees who request compensating time off in lieu of overtime pay;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any individual employed as a seaman whether or not the seaman is employed on a vessel other than an American vessel;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seasonal employees who are employed at concessions and recreational establishments at agricultural fairs, including those seasonal employees employed by agricultural fairs, within the state provided that the period of employment for any seasonal employee at any or all agricultural fairs does not exceed fourteen working days a year;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Any industry in which federal law provides for an overtime payment based on a workweek other than forty hours. However, the provisions of the federal law regarding overtime payment based on a workweek other than forty hours shall nevertheless apply to employees covered by this section without regard to the existence of actual federal jurisdiction over the industrial activity of the particular employer within this state. For the purposes of this subsection, &quot;industry&quot; means a trade, business, industry, or other activity, or branch, or group thereof, in which individuals are gainfully employed (section 3(h) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended (Public Law 93-259));</p>

<p>The regular rate of pay of the employee is in excess of one and one-half times the minimum hourly rate required under RCW 49.46.020; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than half of the employee's compensation for a representative period, of not less than one month, represents commissions on goods or services.</p>
</li>

<p>In determining the proportion of compensation representing commissions, all earnings resulting from the application of a bona fide commission rate is to be deemed commissions on goods or services without regard to whether the computed commissions exceed the draw or guarantee.</p>
