<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The gross proceeds of sales of abandoned vehicles by a registered tow truck operator under RCW 46.55.130 are not subject to tax under this chapter as the sale of automobile towing and storage services. Rather, such gross proceeds of sales of abandoned vehicles by a registered tow truck operator are subject to tax under this chapter as the sale of tangible personal property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A registered tow truck operator may deduct from amounts taxable under subsection (1) of this section any surplus proceeds required by law to be transmitted to the department of licensing as required under RCW 46.55.130 and 46.55.200.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;abandoned vehicle&quot; and &quot;registered tow truck operator&quot; have the same meanings as provided in RCW 46.55.010.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>

<p>A registered tow truck operator must collect the applicable taxes under RCW 82.08.020 when making a retail sale of abandoned vehicles at a public auction or to a licensed vehicle wrecker, hulk hauler, or scrap processor, as provided in RCW 46.55.130, unless the sale is specifically exempt from tax under this chapter. For the purposes of this chapter, such sales are treated solely as the sale of tangible personal property and not as the sale of automobile towing and storage services.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that licensed auto wreckers, scrap processors, and hulk haulers generally make wholesale purchases of abandoned vehicles from registered tow truck operators and therefore would not owe sales tax on the acquisition of abandoned vehicles notwithstanding this act. The legislature does not intend to modify the tax characterization of these vehicle acquisitions by auto wreckers, scrap processors, and hulk haulers with the enactment of this act.</p>
<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
