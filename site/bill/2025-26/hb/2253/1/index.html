<p>The department may issue a probationary license to a licensee who has had a license but is temporarily unable to comply with a rule or has been the subject of multiple complaints or concerns about noncompliance if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The noncompliance does not present an immediate threat to the health and well-being of the children but would be likely to do so if allowed to continue; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The licensee has a plan approved by the department to correct the area of noncompliance within the probationary period.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A probationary license may be issued for up to six months, and at the discretion of the department it may be extended for an additional six months. The department shall immediately terminate the probationary license, if at any time the noncompliance for which the probationary license was issued presents an immediate threat to the health or well-being of the children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may, at any time, issue a probationary license for due cause that states the conditions of probation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An existing license is invalidated when a probationary license is issued.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the expiration of the probationary license, the department shall reinstate the original license for the remainder of its term, issue a new license, or revoke the original license.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A right to an adjudicative proceeding shall not accrue to the licensee whose license has been placed on probationary status unless the licensee does not agree with the placement on probationary status and the department then suspends, revokes, or modifies the license.</p>

<li>
<p>Each agency shall make application for a license or renewal of license to the department on forms prescribed by the department. A licensed agency having foster family homes under its supervision may make application for a license on behalf of any such foster family home. Such a foster home license shall cease to be valid when the home is no longer under the supervision of that agency. Upon receipt of such application, the department shall either grant or deny a license within ninety days unless the application is for licensure as a foster family home, in which case RCW 74.15.040 shall govern. A license shall be granted if the agency meets the minimum requirements set forth in this chapter and RCW 74.13.031 and the departmental requirements consistent herewith, except that an initial license may be issued as provided in RCW 74.15.120. Licenses provided for in this chapter and RCW 74.13.031 shall be issued for a period of three years, unless the license has been inactive.

Provided the new location and licensees meet minimum licensing standards, the licensor shall amend the license to reflect the new location. Licensees whose family remains intact and have no children placed in their care at the time of a move to a new location shall notify their licensor within ninety days of moving. If the licensee is in good standing at the time of the move, the licensor shall place the home on no-referral status and complete a home inspection within thirty days of notification. Such licensees shall remain on no-referral status and no new placements may be made in their home until the inspection is complete and the licensor determines that the new location meets minimum licensing standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall develop rules in collaboration with impacted groups, which will include a definition of &quot;inactive,&quot; a process to assess, and exceptions.</p>
