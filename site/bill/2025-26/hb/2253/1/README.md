2. A probationary license may be issued for up to six months, and at the discretion of the department it may be extended for an additional six months.

Upon receipt of such application, the department shall either grant or deny a license within ninety days unless the application is for licensure as a foster family home, in which case RCW 74.15.040 shall govern.

Such licensees shall remain on no-referral status and no new placements may be made in their home until the inspection is complete and the licensor determines that the new location meets minimum licensing standards.

2. The department shall develop rules in collaboration with impacted groups, which will include a definition of "inactive," a process to assess, and exceptions.
