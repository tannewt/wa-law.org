# HB 1201 - Identifying accommodations allowing pets in an emergency or extreme weather event.

## Section 1
The legislature finds that natural disasters and extreme weather events, including wildfire, flooding, earthquakes, extreme heat, and extreme cold present severe risks to public health and safety in Washington.

The legislature further finds that pets are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather conditions, including risk of heatstroke-related illness and death.

The legislature further finds that many families consider their pets to be family members. One of the most significant factors affecting evacuation decisions is pet ownership. Pet owners may refuse evacuation, attempt to reenter evacuated sites to rescue their pets, and experience grief, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder due to separation from their pet during an emergency. In addition, zoonotic disease risks increase when pets are abandoned or left to roam during an evacuation.

The legislature further finds that gaps in public preparedness and cosheltering opportunities during a disaster or extreme weather event increase the risk to public health and safety.

The legislature further finds that partnerships with nongovernmental organizations support emergency planning and preparedness and may be used to support identification and operation of coshelters.

Therefore, the legislature intends to provide guidance in increasing public preparedness and identifying shelters that can accommodate pets so that in the event of a disaster or extreme weather event, Washington residents will not have to choose between seeking safety and staying with their pets.

## Section 2
1. A county or city, under existing plan structures, shall, to the extent practicable based on available resources and site-specific circumstances, consider emergency shelters, cooling centers, and warming centers able to accommodate persons with pets in each update of its local comprehensive emergency management plan required by RCW 38.52.070.

    a. A local comprehensive emergency management plan must:

        i. Identify at least one emergency shelter within a county or city's jurisdiction, to the extent practicable, that can accommodate persons with pets;

        ii. Identify at least one cooling center within a county or city's jurisdiction, to the extent practicable, that can accommodate persons with pets; and

        iii. Identify at least one heating center within a county or city's jurisdiction, to the extent practicable, that can accommodate persons with pets.

    b. An emergency shelter that is identified to accommodate persons with pets must have safety procedures regarding the sheltering of pets and comply with disaster assistance policies and procedures published by the federal emergency management agency.

2. A county or city shall provide pet emergency preparedness information on its website, including:

    a. To the extent practicable, whether each designated emergency shelter, cooling center, or heating center can accommodate pets;

    b. Information for creating a pet evacuation plan and emergency checklist, consistent with the federal emergency management agency recommendations; and

    c. Identification of local organizations that provide emergency pet assistance.

3. The following definitions apply to this section:

    a. "Cooling center" means a facility that mitigates the public health impacts of extreme heat;

    b. "Emergency shelter" means a temporary location that provides basic shelter for individuals affected by an emergency or disaster;

    c. "Pet" means a domesticated animal, such as a dog or cat, that is commonly kept in the home for pleasure rather than for commercial purposes; and
