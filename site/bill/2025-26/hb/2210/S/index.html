<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington has a proud tradition of promoting voter freedom and secure elections, which are the bedrock of our state democracy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that federal voting rights protections are undergoing significant changes, and additional uncertainty is expected in the coming years. These developments may limit or alter the tools historically available to protect against vote dilution and ensure equitable access to the electoral process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that election methods such as ranked choice voting and proportional representation are used in other jurisdictions to reduce vote splitting, more accurately reflect voter preferences, and support effective and representative local governance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local governments require clear and flexible authority to select election methods that support fair representation, accountable leadership, and voter confidence. Current law does not provide sufficient clarity for jurisdictions interested in adopting alternative election systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To ensure that local jurisdictions retain effective and legally durable options during this period of threats known and unknown, the legislature intends to authorize local governments, for a period of six years, to choose to adopt ranked choice voting, proportional representation, or other approved election methods. Once a jurisdiction elects to use an authorized method within this six-year period, it may continue using that method thereafter. This authority is intended to provide practical tools, reduce litigation risk, and promote stable, transparent local governance while federal standards continue to evolve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this act diminishes existing rights or remedies under state law, including the Washington voting rights act, chapter 29A.92 RCW. This act is intended solely to expand the range of lawful election tools available to local jurisdictions during the specified decision period.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, a county, city, town, school district, fire district, or port district may conduct its elections using ranked choice voting. A county, city, town, school district, fire district, or port district that opts to conduct its elections using ranked choice voting must adopt ranked choice voting before December 31, 2032. A county, city, town, school district, fire district, or port district that adopts ranked choice voting may, but need not, use ranked choice voting for all offices in an election.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A city, town, school district, fire district, or port district that has voters in more than one county may conduct an election using ranked choice voting only if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Another city, town, or district that lies entirely within at least two of the counties in which the city, town, or district has voters uses ranked choice voting; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A court orders the use of ranked choice voting as provided in this section as a remedy under RCW 29A.92.110.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ranked choice voting may not be used in an election for an office for which two or fewer candidates are competing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An election using ranked choice voting must meet the following requirements:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The county auditor shall design the ballot to allow a voter to rank the candidates for a particular office in order of preference, including one write-in candidate;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county auditor must allow a voter to rank at least five candidates per office. The secretary of state may adopt rules that determine the maximum number of candidates per office that a voter is allowed to rank on a ballot in order to accommodate technical limitations from voting systems and ensure compatibility with all ballot formats;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A voter does not need to rank the maximum number of candidates. The county auditor shall count a ballot regardless of how many candidates the voter has ranked. The county auditor shall not count votes for rankings made by a voter that are greater than the maximum number of rankings allowed for each office;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a voter skips one or more numbers in ranking candidates, or ranks an invalid write-in candidate, the county auditor shall count any votes after the skipped number for the voter's next-highest ranked candidates as if the voter had not skipped the number;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a voter provides the same number ranking to more than one candidate, the county auditor may not count that vote ranking for any candidate and may not count a vote for any subsequent number ranking for that office;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The election must be one of two types of ranked choice voting elections. If the election is a single-winner contest, including an election in which multiple positions with the same name, district number, or title are dealt with as separate offices, the winner of each contest must be determined using the instant runoff voting method, as defined in this section and further provided in secretary of state rules. If the election is a multiwinner contest in which the positions are not dealt with as separate offices, the winners must be determined using the single transferable vote method, as defined in this section and further provided in secretary of state rules;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the requisite number of officers have not been elected, or selected to continue to further rounds of vote tabulation, by reason of two or more persons having an equal and highest number of votes for the same office, the official empowered by state law to issue the original certificate of election shall resolve the tie as provided in RCW 29A.60.221.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A county, city, town, or district that conducts a general election for a single-winner contest using ranked choice voting must hold a primary to winnow candidates for the election to a final list of five candidates. The primary is not conducted using ranked choice voting. Voters in the primary may vote for one candidate, and the top five candidates will be certified as qualified to appear on the general election ballot. A county, city, town, or district that conducts a general election for a multiwinner contest using ranked choice voting may not hold a primary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A county, city, town, or district that adopts ranked choice voting must consult with its county auditor to determine the date when ranked choice voting will be implemented, which must be within two years following its adoption, unless a specific implementation date is provided in a court order directing a jurisdiction to use ranked choice voting as a remedy under RCW 29A.92.110.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county auditor whose county encompasses a county, city, town, or district that adopts ranked choice voting is responsible for the implementation of the system. If a city, town, or district has voters in two or more counties, each county auditor in which the city, town, or district has voters is responsible for its implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The secretary of state shall adopt rules to administer this section by May 1, 2027. The secretary's rules must address, at minimum:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Procedures for administering an election that includes voters in more than one county as provided in subsection (2) of this section; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Procedures for tabulating votes under the instant runoff voting method and single transferable vote method as provided in subsection (4) of this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>As used in this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Ranked choice voting&quot; means a method of counting votes in which votes are tabulated based on a voter's ranking of candidates in order of preference as provided in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Instant runoff voting method&quot; means a method of counting votes in which ballots are counted in rounds and the candidate receiving the fewest number of votes is eliminated, continuing until one candidate receives a majority of all votes counted in that round and is declared the winner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Single transferable vote method&quot; means a method of counting votes in which:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>A winning threshold is calculated based on the number of votes cast and the number of seats to be filled, plus one;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ballots are counted in rounds, and at the end of each round any candidate who receives enough votes to pass the winning threshold is declared elected. Any votes received by that candidate in excess of the threshold to win are transferred to other candidates. After all such votes have been transferred so that no candidate has votes exceeding the winning threshold, the candidate with the least number of votes is eliminated, and their votes are transferred to other candidates in the next round; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The counting process stops when the number of elected candidates equals the number of seats to be filled, or the number of candidates remaining equals the number of seats not yet filled by an elected candidate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A jurisdiction that, by the effective date of this section, has adopted ranked choice voting may continue to use ranked choice voting, and the provisions of subsection (5) do not apply to that jurisdiction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the requisite number of any federal, state, county, city, or district offices have not been nominated in a primary by reason of two or more persons having an equal and requisite number of votes for being placed on the general election ballot, the official empowered by state law to certify candidates for the general election ballot shall give notice to the several persons so having the equal and requisite number of votes to attend at the appropriate office at the time designated by that official, who shall then and there proceed publicly to decide by lot which of those persons will be declared nominated and placed on the general election ballot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the requisite number of any federal, state, county, city, district, or precinct officers have not been elected by reason of two or more persons having an equal and highest number of votes for one and the same office, the official empowered by state law to issue the original certificate of election shall give notice to the several persons so having the highest and equal number of votes to attend at the appropriate office at the time to be appointed by that official, who shall then and there proceed publicly to decide by lot which of those persons will be declared duly elected, and the official shall make out and deliver to the person thus duly declared elected a certificate of election.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a tie occurring at any point in the counting process of an election conducted using ranked choice voting as provided in section 2 of this act, the official empowered by state law to certify candidates for the general election ballot shall resolve the tie using the lot method described in this section. If the tie occurs before the final round of counting, the tie must be resolved as expeditiously as possible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<p>&quot;Primary&quot; or &quot;primary election&quot; means a procedure for winnowing candidates for public office to a final list of two as part of a special or general election, or to a final list of five in a county, city, town, or district election that uses ranked choice voting as provided in section 2 of this act. Each voter has the right to cast a vote for any candidate for each office without any limitation based on party preference or affiliation, of either the voter or the candidate.</p>
<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
<p>For any office for which a primary was held, only the names of the top two candidates will appear on the general election ballot, unless the election will be conducted using ranked choice voting as provided in section 2 of this act, in which case only the names of the top five candidates will appear on the general election ballot; the name of the candidate who received the greatest number of votes will appear first and the candidate who received the next greatest number of votes will appear second. No candidate's name may be printed on the subsequent general election ballot unless he or she receives at least one percent of the total votes cast for that office at the preceding primary, if a primary was conducted. On the ballot at the general election for an office for which no primary was held, the names of the candidates shall be listed in the order determined pursuant to RCW 29A.36.131.</p>
<h2 id="section-6">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A primary is a first stage in the public process by which voters elect candidates to public office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever candidates for a partisan office are to be elected, the general election must be preceded by a primary conducted under this chapter, unless the general election is a multiwinner contest using ranked choice voting as provided in section 2 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based upon votes cast at the primary, the top two candidates, or the top five candidates in a primary for a single-winner general election conducted using ranked choice voting as provided in section 2 of this act, will be certified as qualified to appear on the general election ballot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No primary may be held for any single county partisan office to fill an unexpired term if, after the last day allowed for candidates to withdraw, only one candidate has filed for the position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For partisan office, if a candidate has expressed a party preference on the declaration of candidacy, then that preference will be shown after the name of the candidate on the primary and general election ballots as set forth in rules of the secretary of state. A candidate may choose to express no party preference. Any party preferences are shown for the information of voters only and may in no way limit the options available to voters.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-7">Section 7 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>No primary may be held for any single position in any nonpartisan office if, after the last day allowed for candidates to withdraw, there are no more than two candidates filed for the position. The county auditor shall as soon as possible notify all the candidates so affected that the office for which they filed will not appear on the primary ballot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No primary may be held for an office in a county, city, town, or district that is conducting a multiwinner general election using ranked choice voting as provided in section 2 of this act.</p>

<p>Whenever a voting jurisdiction changes to a method of ranking candidates, the county auditor, in coordination with that jurisdiction, must notify the public of the change and create a public education campaign focused on familiarizing voters with any unique elements of the new process pursuant to best practices.
