## Section 2
1. Any person who has purchased fuel on which tax has been paid may file a claim with the department for a refund of the tax for:

    a. Fuel used for purposes other than for the propulsion of motor vehicles upon the public highways in this state. However, a refund may not be made for motor vehicle fuel consumed by a motor vehicle required to be registered under chapter 46.16A RCW.

    b. Fuel exported for use outside of this state. Fuel carried from this state in the fuel tank of a motor vehicle is deemed to be exported from this state. Fuel distributed to a federally recognized Indian tribal reservation located within the state of Washington is not considered exported outside this state.

    d. Fuel which is lost or destroyed, while the licensee is the owner thereof, through fire, lightning, flood, windstorm, or explosion.

    f. Fuel used in power pumping units or other power take‑off equipment of any motor vehicle which is accurately measured by metering devices that have been specifically approved by the department or by a formula determined by the department.

2. Any person who has purchased special fuel on which tax has been paid may file a claim with the department for a refund of tax for:

    a. Special fuel used for the operation of a motor vehicle as a part of or incidental to logging operations upon a highway under federal jurisdiction within the boundaries of a federal area if the federal government requires a fee for the privilege of operating the motor vehicle upon the highway, the proceeds of which are reserved for constructing or maintaining roads in the federal area, or requires maintenance or construction work to be performed on the highway for the privilege of operating the motor vehicle on the highway;

    b. Special fuel used by special mobile equipment as defined in RCW 46.04.552;

    c. Special fuel used in a motor vehicle for movement between two pieces of private property wherein the movement is incidental to the primary use of the vehicle; and

3. Any person who has purchased motor vehicle fuel on which tax has been paid may file a claim with the department for a refund of tax for:

    a. Motor vehicle fuel used by a private, nonprofit transportation provider regulated under chapter 81.66 RCW to provide transportation services for persons with special transportation needs;

    b. Motor vehicle fuel used by an urban passenger transportation system. For purposes of this subsection "urban passenger transportation system" means every transportation system, publicly or privately owned, having as its principal source of revenue the income from transporting persons for compensation by means of motor vehicles or trackless trolleys, each having a seating capacity of over 15 persons, over prescribed routes in such a manner that the routes of such motor vehicles or trackless trolleys, either alone or in conjunction with routes of other such motor vehicles or trackless trolleys subject to the routing by the same transportation system, do not extend for a distance exceeding 15 road miles beyond the corporate limits of the city in which the original starting points of such motor vehicles or trackless trolleys are located. No refunds are authorized for fuel used on any trip where any portion of the trip is more than 15 road miles beyond the corporate limits of the city in which the trip originated; and

    c. Special fuel or motor vehicle fuel used by school districts governed by chapter 28A.160 RCW.

4. Recovery for such loss or destruction under subsections (1)(d) or (e) or (2)(d) of this section must be susceptible to positive proof thereby enabling the department to conduct such investigation and require such information as it may deem necessary. In the event that the department is not satisfied that the fuel was lost, destroyed, or contaminated as claimed because information or proof as required hereunder is not sufficient to substantiate the accuracy of the claim, it may deem such as sufficient cause to deny all right relating to the refund or credit for the excise tax paid on fuel alleged to be lost or destroyed.

5. No refund or claim for credit may be approved by the department unless the gallons of fuel claimed as nontaxable satisfy the conditions specifically set forth in this section and the nontaxable event or use occurred during the period covered by the refund claim. Refunds or claims for credit are not  allowed for anticipated nontaxable use or events.
