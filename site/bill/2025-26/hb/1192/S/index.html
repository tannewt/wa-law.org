<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The department shall provide the offender with written notice of the alleged violation and the evidence supporting it. The notice must include a statement of the rights specified in this subsection, and the offender's right to file a personal restraint petition under court rules after the final decision;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless the offender waives the right to a hearing, the department shall hold a hearing, and shall record it electronically. For offenders not in total confinement, the department shall hold a hearing within fifteen business days, but not less than twenty-four hours, after written notice of the alleged violation. For offenders in total confinement, the department shall hold a hearing within five business days, but not less than twenty-four hours, after written notice of the alleged violation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The offender shall have the right to: (i) Be present at the hearing; (ii) have the assistance of a person qualified to assist the offender in the hearing, appointed by the hearing officer if the offender has a language or communications barrier; (iii) testify or remain silent; (iv) call witnesses and present documentary evidence; (v) question witnesses who appear and testify; and (vi) receive a written summary of the reasons for the hearing officer's decision; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sanction shall take effect if affirmed by the hearing officer. The offender may appeal the sanction to a panel of three reviewing officers designated by the secretary or by the secretary's designee. The offender's appeal must be in writing and hand-delivered to department staff, or postmarked, within seven days after the sanction was imposed. The appeals panel shall affirm, reverse, modify, vacate, or remand based on its findings. If a majority of the panel finds that the sanction was not reasonably related to any of the following: (i) The crime of conviction; (ii) the violation committed; (iii) the offender's risk of reoffending; or (iv) the safety of the community, then the panel will reverse, vacate, remand, or modify the sanction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section, the hearings officer may not rely on unconfirmed or unconfirmable allegations to find that the offender violated a condition. Any alleged violations of the conditions of community custody must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hearing officers shall report through a chain of command separate from that of community corrections officers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In any hearing for an alleged violation of the disciplinary rules of total confinement, the alleged violation must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. If the hearing officer finds the incarcerated individual not guilty of a violation, disciplinary sanctions shall not be imposed on the incarcerated individual for that violation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In any hearing for an alleged violation of the disciplinary rules or required conditions of partial confinement, the alleged violation must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. If the hearing officer determines that the allegation has not been proven by a preponderance of the evidence at the hearing, the partial confinement status of the individual must continue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall adopt rules necessary to implement this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The department shall adopt, by rule, a system that clearly links an inmate's behavior and participation in available education and work programs with the receipt or denial of earned early release days and other privileges. The system shall include increases or decreases in the degree of liberty granted the inmate within the programs operated by the department, access to or withholding of privileges available within correctional institutions, and recommended increases or decreases in the number of earned early release days that an inmate can earn for good conduct and good performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Earned early release days shall be recommended by the department as a reward for accomplishment. The system shall be fair, measurable, and understandable to offenders, staff, and the public. At least once in each twelve-month period, the department shall inform the offender in writing as to his or her conduct and performance. This written evaluation shall include reasons for awarding or not awarding recommended earned early release days for good conduct and good performance. An inmate is not eligible to receive earned early release days during any time in which he or she refuses to participate in an available education or work program into which he or she has been placed under RCW 72.09.460.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall provide each offender in its custody a written description of the system created under this section. The system created under this section must conform to section 2 of this act.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This act takes effect January 1, 2026.</p>
