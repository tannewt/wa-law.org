# HB 1503 - Digital equity

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1503.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature reaffirms the findings made in section 102, chapter 265, Laws of 2022, in particular the findings that access to the internet is essential to participating in modern day society; the cost of being online continues to be unaffordable for many people in both rural and urban areas; and that, across the state, there is a lack of affordable plans, barriers to enrolling in appropriate broadband plans, and barriers to fully utilizing the opportunities that broadband offers.

The legislature further reaffirms its intent to broaden access to the internet, the appropriate devices, and the skills to operate online safely and effectively so that all people in Washington can fully participate in our society, democracy, and economy by expanding assistance and support programs offered in the state.

To support the state's efforts in providing access to the internet and the skills to effectively and safely utilize it, the legislature intends to support existing cross-agency collaboration, in particular between the department of commerce and the office of equity. The legislature intends to facilitate this collaboration, in which the department of commerce has primary responsibility for increasing access to broadband and related infrastructure, and the office of equity has primary responsibility for increasing digital equity by facilitating the provision of digital devices and services to individuals and communities in Washington.
