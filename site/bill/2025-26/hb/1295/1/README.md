# HB 1295 - Reading and writing literacy

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1295.pdf)

## Section 1
1. [Empty]

    a. The legislature finds that, during the 2022-23 school year, 36 percent of third grade students and 40 percent of fourth grade students were identified as reading below grade level. Learning to read and write is a core element of the state's statutory program of basic education and is the foundation for many other elements of the basic education program.

    b. The legislature recognizes that, during the 2021-22 school year, the system established to screen students for risks associated with reading difficulties, including dyslexia, identified over 20 percent of students as at risk and in need of additional supports.

2. [Empty]

    a. The legislature finds that, in 2009, the United States department of education published a practice guide with evidence-based suggestions for implementing multitier interventions that are feasible and based on evidence from rigorous research. One of the recommendations is to use a curriculum that addresses the components of reading instruction (comprehension, fluency, phonemic awareness, phonics, and vocabulary) and relates to students' needs and developmental levels. The legislature acknowledges that these components are often referred to as "structured literacy."

    b. Therefore, the legislature intends that these components be incorporated into foundational curricula and expectations for teaching reading and writing in Washington public schools.

3. [Empty]

    a. The legislature understands recent research indicates that African American and Hispanic children who show signs of dyslexia are less likely than white children to be identified as dyslexic through school screening programs, even after controlling for income level. The legislature recognizes that the scientific literature on reading and cognition indicates that instruction using the principles of structured literacy will benefit almost all students, not only those with indicators of dyslexia.

    b. Therefore, the legislature intends to address this serious equity problem by ensuring that all students receive evidence-based reading and writing instruction using the principles of structured literacy.

4. [Empty]

    a. The legislature recognizes that all elementary educators who support early literacy and reading and writing literacy need professional development on using the principles of structured literacy.

    b. Therefore, the legislature intends to require that preservice and in-service elementary educators be trained to teach students to read and write using the evidence-based instructional practices in early literacy and reading and writing literacy.

## Section 2
1. School districts

shall implement a comprehensive literacy program that uses evidence-based instructional practices to promote the early literacy and reading and writing literacy of students in kindergarten through fourth grade. School districts are encouraged to phase in use of the program elements beginning with the 2025-26 school year and shall fully implement all program elements by the beginning of the 2027-28 school year.

2. A comprehensive literacy program required by subsection (1) of this section must:

    a. Include at least the following essential components: Semantics or comprehending written language; reading and writing fluency; orthographic knowledge or phonics; phonology and phonemic awareness; and vocabulary or oral language knowledge and proficiency;

    b. Be systemic, sequential, and cumulative;

    c. Provide direct, explicit, and rigorous instruction that is high quality, culturally relevant, and knowledge rich;

    d. Be diagnostic of and responsive to individual student needs, including by being multisensory and multimodal;

    e. Provide instruction and services, including literacy interventions under RCW 28A.320.260, using the framework of the Washington integrated student supports protocol, established under RCW 28A.300.139, within a multitiered system of supports;

    f. Use screening assessments and other tools to identify at-risk readers in kindergarten through fourth grade, such as the Washington kindergarten inventory of developing skills, the Washington state early learning and development guidelines for birth through third grade, literacy screenings for students in kindergarten through second grade under RCW 28A.320.260, the second grade reading assessment under RCW 28A.300.310, and locally used assessments and other tools;

    g. For students in third grade who are reading below grade level, implement intensive reading improvement strategies under RCW 28A.655.230 and 28A.655.235; and

    h. Use research-based family involvement and engagement strategies, including strategies to help families and guardians assist in improving students' reading and early literacy skills at home.

## Section 3
1. By September 1, 2026, the Washington professional educator standards board shall adopt revised standards for teacher endorsements with reading and writing literacy competencies. The revised standards must include those competencies necessary to participate in the delivery of a comprehensive literacy program under RCW 28A.320.202 (as recodified by this act), which, among other requirements, includes the essential components of phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension.

2. The Washington professional educator standards board shall require approved educator preparation programs offering teacher endorsements with reading and writing literacy competencies to incorporate the revised standards into their programs by the beginning of the 2027-28 academic year.
