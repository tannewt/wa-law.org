<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Leftover paint products are a waste management issue and present environmental risks and health and safety risks, especially to workers in the solid waste industry. During waste collection and processing, wet paint can create spills and splashes and oil paint containers may rupture, releasing fumes hazardous to workers and the remaining liquids may contribute to leachate problems in landfills. Some local governments are able to devote resources to provide collection sites or events for latex paint in order to provide their residents with at least some disposal options and to keep latex paint out of the solid waste stream. But residents and small businesses need additional and more convenient options for disposal of  paint products. Drying latex for disposal is difficult for many residents and is wasteful of latex paint that can otherwise be reused or recycled. Local government special and moderate-risk waste collection programs are heavily impacted by the cost of managing unwanted paint products and these costs decrease the available funds to address other hazardous and hard-to-handle materials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nationally, an estimated average of 10 percent of architectural paint purchased becomes leftover paint. Current programs only collect a fraction of the potential leftover paint for proper reuse, recycling, or disposal. There is not a comprehensive statewide, end-of-life management plan for  paint products, resulting in significant missed opportunities to reduce, reuse, and recycle paint.</p>
</li>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>It is in the best interest of Washington for paint manufacturers to assume responsibility for the development and implementation of a cost-effective paint product stewardship program that:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Develops and implements strategies to reduce the generation of leftover paint products;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promotes the reuse of leftover paint products;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collects, transports, and processes leftover paint products for end-of-life management, including reuse, recycling, energy recovery, and disposal; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides for transparency under chapter 42.56 RCW, the public records act.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A paint product stewardship program will follow the paint waste management hierarchy for managing and reducing leftover paint products in the order as follows:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Reduce consumer generation of leftover paint products;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reuse;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recycle; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide for energy recovery and disposal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The establishment of a comprehensive leftover paint product management program that requires paint product manufacturers to assume responsibility for the collection, recycling, reuse, transportation, and disposal of leftover paint products, and that allows paint retailers to voluntarily participate in the collection of leftover paint products, will provide more opportunities for consumers to properly manage their leftover paint products, provide fiscal relief for local government in managing leftover paint products, keep paint products out of the waste stream, and conserve natural resources.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington's existing waste collection, recycling, and disposal system leads the nation in innovation and environmentally sound practices. This system has achieved some of the highest overall recycling rates in the nation at 51 percent in 2012. The legislature further finds that leftover paint products may be a toxic and hard-to-handle waste product that is appropriate for a product stewardship program to increase the safe, convenient, and effective reuse, recycling, and disposal of leftover paint. Product stewardship programs for toxic and hard-to-handle materials, including a paint product stewardship program, should integrate with and complement the existing waste collection, recycling, and disposal system.</p>

<li>
<p>This chapter creates a paint product stewardship program to be enforced by the department.</p>

<li>
<p>A stewardship organization representing producers shall submit a plan for the implementation of a paint product stewardship program to the department for approval by May 30, 2020, or within one year of July 28, 2019, whichever comes later. Each paint product stewardship organization must update its plan to address all paint products by July 1, 2029. The plan must include the following components:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A description of how the program proposed under the plan will collect, transport, recycle, and process leftover paint and associated packaging from covered entities for end-of-life management, including reuse, recycling, energy recovery, and disposal, using environmentally sound management practices;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stewardship organization contact information and a list of participating brands and producers under the program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A demonstration of sufficient funding for the  paint product stewardship program as described in the plan. The plan must include a funding mechanism whereby each  paint product producer remits to the stewardship organization payment of a paint product stewardship assessment for each container of  paint product the producer sells in this state, unless the distributor or paint retailer has negotiated a voluntary agreement with the producer and stewardship organization to remit the  assessment directly to the stewardship organization on behalf of the producer for the producer's  paint products sold by the distributor or paint retailer in the state.

The  paint product stewardship assessment must be added to the cost of all  paint products sold to Washington paint retailers and distributors, unless the distributor or paint retailer has negotiated an agreement voluntarily with the producer and stewardship organization to remit the assessment directly to the stewardship organization on behalf of the producer for the producer's  paint products sold by the distributor or paint retailer in the state. Each Washington paint retailer or distributor must add the assessment to the purchase price of all  paint products sold in this state. Manufacturers may not require retailers to opt to participate in a voluntary remittance agreement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The establishment in the plan of a uniform  paint product stewardship assessment for all  paint products sold in this state, in order to ensure that the funding mechanism is equitable and sustainable. For purposes of establishing the assessment, the plan must categorize the product types and sizes of  containers sold at retail and determine a uniform assessment amount that applies to each product type and container size to cover the paint product categories specified in RCW 70A.515.020(18)(a) (i) through (iv). The  paint product stewardship assessment must be sufficient to recover the costs of the  paint product stewardship program. With the exception of the annual administration costs paid to the department under RCW 70A.515.060(4), the department may not control or have spending authority related to the funds received by the stewardship organization from the assessment. Funds received by the stewardship organization are not state funds and are not eligible to be transferred for other state purposes in an appropriations act. The plan must require that any surplus funds generated from the funding mechanism that exceed a reserve greater than the most recent year's operating expenditures be put back into the program to either increase and improve program services or reduce the cost of the program and the  paint product stewardship assessment, or both;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A review by an independent financial auditor of the proposed  paint product stewardship assessment to ensure that any added cost to paint sold in the state as a result of the paint product stewardship program does not exceed the costs of the program. In a report to the department, the independent auditor must verify that the amount added to each unit of paint will cover the costs of the paint product stewardship program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assignment to the department of responsibility for the approval of the  paint product stewardship assessment based on the information provided in the plan and the auditor's report;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A description of the educational outreach strategy to reduce the generation of leftover paint products, to promote the reuse and recycling of leftover paint products, for the overall collection of leftover paint products, and for the proper end-of-life management of leftover paint products. The strategies may be revised by a stewardship organization based on the information collected annually;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A description of the reasonably convenient and available statewide collection system, including:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>A description of how the program will provide for reasonably convenient and available statewide collection of leftover paint products from covered entities in urban and rural areas of the state, including island communities;</p>
