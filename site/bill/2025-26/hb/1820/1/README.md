# HB 1820 - Family vlogs/minor children

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1820.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that social media influencers can make significant amounts of money from the digital content they produce. Some influencers use their minor children as subjects of that content. Those children are generating interest in and revenue for the content, but receive no financial compensation for their participation. Unlike in child acting, these children are not playing a part, and lack legal protections.

2. The legislature finds that social media influencers who market video content of their families, or "vloggers" can profit from the personal property rights of their children without restriction. Some children are filmed, with highly personal details of their lives shared on the internet for compensation, from birth. In addition to a severe loss of privacy, these children receive no consideration for the use and exchange of their personal property rights.

3. The legislature intends to allow minors to receive proportional compensation for the use of specified personal property rights where their parents have reached a specified profit threshold from that use. The legislature also intends to provide for minors to exercise control over specified personal property rights upon reaching the age of majority.

## Section 3
1. A vlogger meeting the criteria under subsection (2) of this section must compensate the vlogger's minor child whose likeness, name, or photograph constitutes the video content meeting the criteria in subsection (2)(a) of this section, in accordance with subsection (3) of this section.

2. This section applies to a vlogger meeting the following criteria at any time within the previous 12-month period:

    b. At least 30 percent of the vlogger's compensated video content produced within a 30-day period included the likeness, name, or photograph of the vlogger's minor child.

Where only one minor child meets the content threshold described in subsection (2)(b) of this section, the percentage of total gross earnings on any video segment including the likeness, name, or photograph of the vlogger's minor child that is equal to or greater than the content percentage that includes the minor child as described in subsection (2) of this section; or

    b. Where more than one minor child meets the content threshold described in subsection (2)(b) of this section and a video segment includes more than one of those children, the additive percentage described in (a) of this subsection for all minor children in any segment must be equally divided between the children, regardless of differences in percentage of content provided by the individual children.

## Section 4
1. Upon the age of majority, any individual to whom as a minor child section 3 of this act previously applied may request the permanent deletion of any video segment including the likeness, name, or photograph of the individual from any internet platform or network that provided compensation to the individual's parent or parents in exchange for that video content.

2. An internet platform or network must take all reasonable steps to permanently delete the video segment for which a request described in subsection (1) of this section has been made.

3. Any contract with an internet platform or network for the exchange or use of video content that would reasonably be anticipated to include greater than a de minimis use of a vlogger's minor child must include notification to the internet platform or network of the minor child's future rights as provided in this section.
