<ol>
<li>
<p>A city or town must allow neighborhood stores and neighborhood cafés to be permitted in any zone allowing residential uses provided that a café must offer food if alcoholic drinks are offered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cities and towns may regulate parking provided that the regulations are not infeasible.</p>
</li>

Neighborhood stores permitted in residential zones may not sell products containing nicotine, either as a tobacco product or manufactured nicotine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cities may establish additional regulations as necessary, including regulations relating to signage and advertising that are visible from the street for neighborhood stores and cafes and maximum square footage requirements. Nothing in this section limits a city's zoning authority to regulate neighborhood cafes and neighborhood stores as the city would with other uses in the same zoning district provided that all such regulations adopted by a city are both consistent with this section and are no more restrictive than the development regulations governing residential uses within the same zoning district.</p>

All other cities must implement the requirements of this section within two years of the effective date of this section.</p>
</li>

<p>The requirements of this section do not apply to cities with a population less than 5,000 that are within a contiguous urban growth area with the largest city in a county with a population of more than 275,000, as determined by office of financial management population estimates.</p>
