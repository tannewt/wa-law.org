# HB 1210 - Urban area tax preferences

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1210-S.pdf)

## Section 1
It is the intent of the legislature to ensure that clean energy transformation businesses have equal access to the existing targeted urban area tax preferences under chapter 84.25 RCW. Washington state has a long-standing commitment to world-class clean energy production and to the creation of family-wage jobs in the clean energy sector. Therefore, the legislature intends to allow cities using the targeted urban area tax preferences to extend additional time to clean energy transformation businesses in an effort to grow Washington's economy and implement the legislature's carbon-free energy objectives.
