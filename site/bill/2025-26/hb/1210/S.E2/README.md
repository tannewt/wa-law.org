# HB 1210 - Urban area tax preferences

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1210-S.E2.pdf)

## Section 1
It is the intent of the legislature to ensure that clean energy transformation businesses have equal access to the existing targeted urban area tax preferences under chapter 84.25 RCW. Washington state has a long-standing commitment to world-class clean energy production and to the creation of family wage jobs in the clean energy sector. Therefore, the legislature intends to allow cities using the targeted urban area tax preferences to extend additional time to clean energy transformation businesses in an effort to grow Washington's economy and implement the legislature's carbon-free energy objectives.

## Section 2

1. "City" means any city or town.

2. "Clean energy transformation business" means a business that creates a product for sale that will aid in lowering Washington's carbon emissions.

3. "Family living wage job" means a job that offers health care benefits with a wage that is sufficient for raising a family. A family living wage job must have an average wage of $23 an hour or more, working 2,080 hours per year on the subject site, as adjusted annually for inflation by the consumer price index. The family living wage may be increased by the local authority based on regional factors and wage conditions.

7. "Lands zoned for industrial and manufacturing uses" means lands in a city zoned for an industrial or manufacturing use consistent with the city's comprehensive plan where the lands are designated for industry.

8. "Owner" means the property owner of record.

9. "Targeted area" means an area of undeveloped lands zoned for industrial and manufacturing uses in the city that is located within or contiguous to an innovation partnership zone, foreign trade zone, or EB-5 regional center, and designated for possible exemption under the provisions of this chapter.
