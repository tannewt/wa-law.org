<li>
<p>By February 1st of each year, the self-certifying entity must submit a report to the department covering reportable events from the prior calendar year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The self-certifying entity shall provide the information required by the department under (a) of this subsection. The information provided must include whether the autonomous driving system was operating the vehicle at the time of or immediately prior to the collision or moving violation, and in the case of a collision, details regarding the collision, including any loss of life, injury, or property damage that resulted from the collision.</p>
