## Section 1
The legislature finds that Washington state faces immense workforce challenges to fill both high paying blue and white-collar jobs. The legislature further finds that nearly half of Washington state high school students are not going into an accredited program after school; this means that high school students are not going to college, community college, or trade school. Rather, these students are largely entering the workforce in predominately low-wage jobs. The legislature intends to work with small businesses to support them while they support their employee's reeducation or training, whether that is through trade school, community college, or college, to ultimately fill high-wage jobs in trades or other industries. The legislature intends to provide small businesses with tax relief in exchange for investments in their employee's education at an accredited institution and participation in the financial aid process to help improve access to the Washington college grant, among other financial aid options. By partnering with small businesses, the legislature intends to help these businesses invest in their employee's long-term success. The legislature intends that the success of this tax preference to be measured through the increased growth of small businesses and in enrollment in accredited institutions.
