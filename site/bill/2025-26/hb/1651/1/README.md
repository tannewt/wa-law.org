This collaborative model is offered by a public elementary or secondary school and a board-approved teacher preparation program.

2. At a minimum, a teacher residency program must meet the following requirements:

    a. The program must be operated as a formal partnership between a school district or state-tribal education compact school and a board-approved teacher preparation program;

    b. The program partners must collaboratively design the coursework to align with the unique context of each resident's classroom;

    c. Each resident must be assigned a preservice mentor;

    d. A preservice mentor must co-teach with the resident throughout the duration of the resident's preservice clinical experience;

    e. Each resident must receive at least 900 hours of preservice clinical practice over the course of one school year;

    f. [Empty]

        i. A resident who is an undergraduate student may not be assigned the lead or primary responsibility for student learning until the resident completes 900 hours of preservice clinical practice; and

        ii. A resident who is a graduate student may not be assigned the lead or primary responsibility for student learning until the resident completes 450 hours of preservice clinical practice;

    g. Each resident must be grouped into a cohort based on geography, specialty, or other relevant criteria determined by the board;

    h. Funding must be provided to each resident; and

        i. A stipend must be provided to each preservice mentor.

3. The board shall establish an approval process for a teacher preparation program in partnership with a school district, state-tribal education compact school, or consortium to either: (a) Become a new teacher preparation program; or (b) transition some or all of an existing teacher preparation program to a teacher residency program.

4. For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:

    a. "Board" means the Washington professional educator standards board.

In addition to meeting other requirements, the program must provide the apprentice with 2,000 hours of on-the-job mentored teaching experience under a gradual release method.

## Section 3
A teacher apprenticeship program must meet the requirements in section 2 of this act.

## Section 4
1. The alternative route and teacher residency conditional scholarship program is created.

3. Participants are eligible to receive an alternative route and teacher residency conditional scholarship for up to two academic years.

## Section 5
1. The legislature recognizes that, in the educator preparation and certification context, the term "residency" refers to the initial certificate of an educator.
