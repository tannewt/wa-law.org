A petition by the public agency on whom the demand is served, stating good cause, to require the prosecuting agency or any person to perform any duty imposed by the provisions of this section, and all other petitions in connection with a demand executed under this section, may be filed in the superior court for Thurston county, or in the county where the public agency is situated or in such other county as may be agreed upon by the parties to such petition. The court shall have jurisdiction to impose such sanctions as are provided for in the civil rules for superior court with respect to discovery motions.

6. Whenever any public agency fails to comply with any civil investigative demand for documentary material under this section, or whenever satisfactory copying or reproduction of any such material cannot be done and such public agency refuses to surrender such material, the prosecuting agency may file, in the trial court of general jurisdiction of the county in which such public agency is situated, and serve upon such public agency a petition for an order of such court for the enforcement of this section, except that if such public agency is situated in more than one county such petition shall be filed in the county in which such public agency maintains its principal place of business, or in such other county as may be agreed upon by the parties to such petition. Whenever any petition is filed in the trial court of general jurisdiction of any county under this section, such court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter presented and to enter such order or orders as may be required to carry into effect the provisions of this section, and may impose such sanctions as are provided for in the civil rules for superior court with respect to discovery motions.
