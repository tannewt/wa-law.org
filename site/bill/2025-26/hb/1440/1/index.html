<li>
<p>Except with respect to contraband items, which shall be seized and summarily forfeited, proceedings for forfeiture are deemed commenced by the seizure. The agency under whose authority the seizure was made shall cause notice to be served within 15 days following the seizure on the owner of the property seized and the person in charge thereof and any person having any known right or interest therein, including any community property interest, of the seizure and intended forfeiture of the seized property. Service of notice of seizure must be made according to the rules of civil procedure, except that service by mail shall be by certified mail, return receipt requested. However, a default judgment with respect to real property may not be obtained against a party who is served by substituted service absent an affidavit stating that a good faith effort has been made to ascertain if the defaulted party is incarcerated within the state, and that there is no present basis to believe that the party is incarcerated within the state. Notice of seizure in the case of property subject to a security interest that has been perfected by filing a financing statement in accordance with chapter 62A.9A RCW, or a certificate of title, must be made by service upon the secured party or the secured party's assignee at the address shown on the financing statement or the certificate of title.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The notice must include information indicating that if the property owner or other person claiming a right or interest in the property contests the forfeiture, the person has the right to move the matter to a court of competent jurisdiction, and if the person substantially prevails in a forfeiture proceeding, the person is entitled to reimbursement for reasonable attorneys' fees.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If no person notifies the seizing agency in writing of the person's claim of ownership or right to possession of an item seized within 60 days of the service of notice from the seizing agency in the case of personal property and 120 days in the case of real property, the item seized is deemed forfeited. The community property interest in real property of a person whose spouse or domestic partner committed a violation giving rise to seizure of the real property may not be forfeited if the person did not participate in the violation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any person notifies the seizing agency in writing of the person's claim of ownership or right to possession of an item seized within 60 days of the service of notice from the seizing agency in the case of personal property and 120 days in the case of real property, the person or persons must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard as to the claim or right. The notice of claim may be served by any method authorized by law or court rule including, but not limited to, service by first-class mail. Service by mail is deemed complete upon mailing within the 60-day period following service of the notice of seizure in the case of personal property and within the 120-day period following service of the notice of seizure in the case of real property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hearing must be before the chief law enforcement officer of the seizing agency or the chief law enforcement officer's designee, except that where the seizing agency is a state agency as defined in RCW 34.12.020(4), the hearing must be before the chief law enforcement officer of the seizing agency or an administrative law judge appointed under chapter 34.12 RCW. Such a hearing and any appeal therefrom must be under Title 34 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any person asserting a claim or right may remove the matter to a court of competent jurisdiction. Removal of any matter involving personal property may only be accomplished according to the rules of civil procedure. The person seeking removal of the matter must serve process against the state, county, political subdivision, or municipality that operates the seizing agency, and any other party of interest, in accordance with RCW 4.28.080 or 4.92.020, within 45 days after the person seeking removal has notified the seizing agency of the person's claim of ownership or right to possession. The court to which the matter is to be removed must be the district court when the aggregate value of personal property is within the jurisdictional limit set forth in RCW 3.66.020.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Whether the matter is heard under Title 34 RCW pursuant to subsection (4) of this section or removed to court pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, the burden of proof is upon the seizing agency to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the property is subject to forfeiture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No personal property may be forfeited to the extent of the interest of an owner, by reason of any act or omission committed or omitted without the owner's knowledge or consent;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No real property may be forfeited to the extent of the interest of an owner, by reason of any act or omission committed or omitted without the owner's knowledge or consent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A forfeiture of real property encumbered by a bona fide security interest is subject to the interest of the secured party if the secured party, at the time the security interest was created, neither had knowledge of nor consented to the act or omission.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The seizing agency shall promptly return seized items, in the same or substantially similar condition as when they were seized, to the claimant upon a determination by the administrative law judge or court that the claimant is the present lawful owner or is lawfully entitled to possession thereof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In any proceeding to forfeit property under this chapter, where the claimant substantially prevails, the claimant is entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the claimant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The protections afforded by the service members' civil relief act, chapter 38.42 RCW, are applicable to proceedings under this chapter.</p>

<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Upon the entry of an order of forfeiture of real property, the court shall forward a copy of the order to the assessor of the county in which the property is located. Orders for the forfeiture of real property shall be entered by the superior court, subject to court rules. Such an order shall be filed by the seizing agency in the county auditor's records in the county in which the real property is located.</p>

<p>A landlord may assert a claim against proceeds from the sale of assets seized and forfeited only if:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>An employee, agent, or officer of the seizing agency, while acting in his or her official capacity, directly caused damage to the complaining landlord's property while executing a search of a tenant's residence; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The landlord has applied any funds remaining in the tenant's deposit, to which the landlord has a right under chapter 59.18 RCW, to cover the damage directly caused by the employee, agent, or officer of the seizing agency prior to asserting a claim under the provisions of this section;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) Only if the funds applied under (a)(ii) of this subsection are insufficient to satisfy the damage directly caused by the employee, agent, or officer of the seizing agency, may the landlord seek compensation for the damage by filing a claim against the governmental entity under whose authority the seizing agency operates within 30 days after the search;</p>
<p>(B) Only if the governmental entity denies or fails to respond to the landlord's claim within 60 days of the date of filing, may the landlord collect damages under this subsection by filing within 30 days of denial or the expiration of the 60-day period, whichever occurs first, a claim with the seizing agency. The seizing agency must notify the landlord of the status of the claim by the end of the 30-day period. Nothing in this section requires the claim to be paid by the end of the 60-day or 30-day period.</p>
<pre><code>b. For any claim filed under (a)(ii) of this subsection, the seizing agency shall pay the claim unless the agency provides substantial proof that the landlord either:

    i. Knew or consented to actions of the tenant in violation of this chapter or the chapter pursuant to which the seizure was made; or

    ii. Failed to respond to a notification of the illegal activity, provided by a law enforcement agency under RCW 59.18.075, within seven days of receipt of notification of the illegal activity.
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>The landlord's claim for damages under subsection (2) of this section may not include a claim for loss of business and is limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Damage to tangible property and clean-up costs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lesser of the cost of repair or fair market value of the damage directly caused by the employee, agent, or officer of the seizing agency;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proceeds from the sale of the specific tenant's property seized and forfeited; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proceeds available after the seizing law enforcement agency satisfies any bona fide security interest in the tenant's property and costs related to sale of the tenant's property.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsections (2) and (3) of this section do not limit any other rights a landlord may have against a tenant to collect for damages. However, if a seizing agency satisfies a landlord's claim under subsection (2) of this section, the rights the landlord has against the tenant for damages directly caused by an employee, agent, or officer of the seizing agency under the terms of the landlord and tenant's contract are subrogated to the seizing agency.</p>

<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<p>When property is forfeited under this chapter, the seizing agency may, after satisfying any court-ordered restitution:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Retain it for official use or upon application by any law enforcement agency of this state release such property to such agency to be used in enforcement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sell that which is not required to be destroyed by law and which is not harmful to the public;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request the appropriate sheriff or director of public safety to take custody of the property and remove it for disposition in accordance with law;</p>

<p>Conducted in collaboration with a federal agency under federal law.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section, &quot;seizing agency&quot; means any police force, multijurisdictional task force, fire department, or other municipal, county, or state agency that has authority under state law or collaborates with a federal agency under federal law to seize property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section, &quot;seizing agency&quot; does not include a state child support agency under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act (49 Stat. 620; 42 U.S.C. Sec. 651 et seq.).</p>

<p>Annually, on a date specified by the Washington state patrol, the seizing agency shall file a report, that includes all of the records in (a) of this subsection, to the Washington state patrol. The Washington state patrol must establish and maintain a searchable public web site that includes all of the records in (a) of this subsection. The annual report need not include a record of forfeited property that is still being held for use as evidence during the investigation or prosecution of a case or during the appeal from a conviction. The commander of a multijurisdictional task force may appoint one agency to report its seizures. If an agency has made no seizures during the previous year, a null report must be filed by the agency specifying that it did not engage in seizures or forfeitures during the reporting period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By March 1st each year, the seizing agency shall file with the Washington state patrol a report that summarizes the agency's expenditures from the sum of the net proceeds of all seized and forfeited property during the previous calendar year. The report must be posted and made available on the web site created in this subsection (4). The report must use the following categories to summarize expenditures and values:</p>

<li>
<p>One hundred twenty days after the close of each fiscal year, the Washington state patrol shall submit to the speaker of the house of representatives, president of the senate, attorney general, and governor a written report summarizing forfeiture activity in the state for the preceding fiscal year; the type, approximate value, and disposition of the property seized; and the amount of any proceeds received or expended at the state and local levels. The report must provide a categorized accounting of all proceeds expended. Summary data on seizures, forfeitures, and expenditures of forfeiture proceeds must be disaggregated by agency. The aggregate report must be made available on the state treasurer's web site.</p>

<p>The Washington state patrol may include in the aggregate report required by subsection (5) of this section recommendations to improve statutes, rules, and policies to facilitate seizure, forfeiture, and expenditure processes and reporting that are fair to crime victims, innocent property owners, secured interest holders, citizens, law enforcement, and taxpayers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a seizing agency fails to file a report within 30 days after it is due, without good cause as determined by the Washington state patrol, the Washington state patrol shall provide a written warning to the seizing agency.

<p>Except as provided in (a)(ii) of this subsection, by January 31st of each year, each seizing agency shall remit to the Washington state patrol an amount equal to 10 percent of the net proceeds of any property forfeited during the preceding calendar year. Money remitted shall be deposited in the state general fund unless otherwise provided in statute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By January 31st of each year, each seizing agency shall remit to the state an amount equal to 10 percent of the net proceeds of any property forfeited under RCW 10.105.010 and 46.61.5058 during the preceding calendar year for deposit into the behavioral health loan repayment program account created in RCW 28B.115.135 through June 30, 2027, and into the state general fund thereafter.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The net proceeds of forfeited property is the value of the forfeitable interest in the property after deducting the cost of satisfying any bona fide security interest to which the property is subject at the time of seizure; and in the case of sold property, after deducting the cost of sale, including reasonable fees or commissions paid to independent selling agents, and the cost of any valid landlord's claim for damages under section 3 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The value of sold forfeited property is the sale price. The value of retained forfeited property is the fair market value of the property at the time of seizure, determined when possible by reference to an applicable commonly used index, such as the index used by the department of licensing for valuation of motor vehicles. A seizing agency may use, but need not use, an independent qualified appraiser to determine the value of retained property. If an appraiser is used, the value of the property appraised is net of the cost of the appraisal. The value of destroyed property and retained firearms or illegal property is zero.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forfeited property and net proceeds not required to be paid to the state shall be retained by the seizing agency exclusively for the expansion and improvement of related enforcement activities. Money retained under this section may not be used to supplant preexisting funding sources.</p>
