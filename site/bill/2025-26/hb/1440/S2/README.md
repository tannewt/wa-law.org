## Section 1
This chapter provides standard procedures governing civil asset forfeiture and is applicable to laws of this state that authorize civil forfeiture of property and that indicate the provisions of this chapter apply.

## Section 2
1. [Empty]

    a. Except with respect to contraband items, which shall be seized and summarily forfeited, proceedings for forfeiture are deemed commenced by the seizure. The agency under whose authority the seizure was made shall cause notice to be served within 15 days following the seizure on the owner of the property seized and the person in charge thereof and any person having any known right or interest therein, including any community property interest, of the seizure and intended forfeiture of the seized property. Service of notice of seizure must be made according to the rules of civil procedure, except that service by mail shall be by certified mail, return receipt requested. However, a default judgment with respect to real property may not be obtained against a party who is served by substituted service absent an affidavit stating that a good faith effort has been made to ascertain if the defaulted party is incarcerated within the state, and that there is no present basis to believe that the party is incarcerated within the state. Notice of seizure in the case of property subject to a security interest that has been perfected by filing a financing statement in accordance with chapter 62A.9A RCW, or a certificate of title, must be made by service upon the secured party or the secured party's assignee at the address shown on the financing statement or the certificate of title.

    b. The notice must include information indicating that if the property owner or other person claiming a right or interest in the property contests the forfeiture, the person has the right to move the matter to a court of competent jurisdiction, and if the person substantially prevails in a forfeiture proceeding, the person is entitled to reimbursement for reasonable attorneys' fees.

2. If no person notifies the seizing agency in writing of the person's claim of ownership or right to possession of an item seized within 60 days of the service of notice from the seizing agency in the case of personal property and 120 days in the case of real property, the item seized is deemed forfeited. The community property interest in real property of a person whose spouse or domestic partner committed a violation giving rise to seizure of the real property may not be forfeited if the person did not participate in the violation.

3. If any person notifies the seizing agency in writing of the person's claim of ownership or right to possession of an item seized within 60 days of the service of notice from the seizing agency in the case of personal property and 120 days in the case of real property, the person or persons must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard as to the claim or right. The notice of claim may be served by any method authorized by law or court rule including, but not limited to, service by first-class mail. Service by mail is deemed complete upon mailing within the 60-day period following service of the notice of seizure in the case of personal property and within the 120-day period following service of the notice of seizure in the case of real property.

4. The hearing must be before the chief law enforcement officer of the seizing agency or the chief law enforcement officer's designee, except that where the seizing agency is a state agency as defined in RCW 34.12.020(4), the hearing must be before the chief law enforcement officer of the seizing agency or an administrative law judge appointed under chapter 34.12 RCW. Such a hearing and any appeal therefrom must be under Title 34 RCW.

5. Any person asserting a claim or right may remove the matter to a court of competent jurisdiction. Removal of any matter involving personal property may only be accomplished according to the rules of civil procedure. The person seeking removal of the matter must serve process against the state, county, political subdivision, or municipality that operates the seizing agency, and any other party of interest, in accordance with RCW 4.28.080 or 4.92.020, within 45 days after the person seeking removal has notified the seizing agency of the person's claim of ownership or right to possession. The court to which the matter is to be removed must be the district court when the aggregate value of personal property is within the jurisdictional limit set forth in RCW 3.66.020.

6. [Empty]

    a. Whether the matter is heard under Title 34 RCW pursuant to subsection (4) of this section or removed to court pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, the burden of proof is upon the seizing agency to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the property is subject to forfeiture.

    b. No personal property may be forfeited to the extent of the interest of an owner, by reason of any act or omission committed or omitted without the owner's knowledge or consent;

    c. No real property may be forfeited to the extent of the interest of an owner, by reason of any act or omission committed or omitted without the owner's knowledge or consent.

    d. A forfeiture of real property encumbered by a bona fide security interest is subject to the interest of the secured party if the secured party, at the time the security interest was created, neither had knowledge of nor consented to the act or omission.

7. The seizing agency shall promptly return seized items, in the same or substantially similar condition as when they were seized, to the claimant upon a determination by the administrative law judge or court that the claimant is the present lawful owner or is lawfully entitled to possession thereof.

8. In any proceeding to forfeit property under this chapter, where the claimant substantially prevails, the claimant is entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the claimant.

9. The protections afforded by the service members' civil relief act, chapter 38.42 RCW, are applicable to proceedings under this chapter.

## Section 3
1. Upon the entry of an order of forfeiture of real property, the court shall forward a copy of the order to the assessor of the county in which the property is located. Orders for the forfeiture of real property shall be entered by the superior court, subject to court rules. Such an order shall be filed by the seizing agency in the county auditor's records in the county in which the real property is located.

2. [Empty]

    a. A landlord may assert a claim against proceeds from the sale of assets seized and forfeited only if:

        i. An employee, agent, or officer of the seizing agency, while acting in his or her official capacity, directly caused damage to the complaining landlord's property while executing a search of a tenant's residence; and

        ii. The landlord has applied any funds remaining in the tenant's deposit, to which the landlord has a right under chapter 59.18 RCW, to cover the damage directly caused by the employee, agent, or officer of the seizing agency prior to asserting a claim under the provisions of this section;

(A) Only if the funds applied under (a)(ii) of this subsection are insufficient to satisfy the damage directly caused by the employee, agent, or officer of the seizing agency, may the landlord seek compensation for the damage by filing a claim against the governmental entity under whose authority the seizing agency operates within 30 days after the search;

(B) Only if the governmental entity denies or fails to respond to the landlord's claim within 60 days of the date of filing, may the landlord collect damages under this subsection by filing within 30 days of denial or the expiration of the 60-day period, whichever occurs first, a claim with the seizing agency. The seizing agency must notify the landlord of the status of the claim by the end of the 30-day period. Nothing in this section requires the claim to be paid by the end of the 60-day or 30-day period.

    b. For any claim filed under (a)(ii) of this subsection, the seizing agency shall pay the claim unless the agency provides substantial proof that the landlord either:

        i. Knew or consented to actions of the tenant in violation of this chapter or the chapter pursuant to which the seizure was made; or

        ii. Failed to respond to a notification of the illegal activity, provided by a law enforcement agency under RCW 59.18.075, within seven days of receipt of notification of the illegal activity.

3. The landlord's claim for damages under subsection (2) of this section may not include a claim for loss of business and is limited to:

    a. Damage to tangible property and clean-up costs;

    b. The lesser of the cost of repair or fair market value of the damage directly caused by the employee, agent, or officer of the seizing agency;

    c. The proceeds from the sale of the specific tenant's property seized and forfeited; and

    d. The proceeds available after the seizing law enforcement agency satisfies any bona fide security interest in the tenant's property and costs related to sale of the tenant's property.

4. Subsections (2) and (3) of this section do not limit any other rights a landlord may have against a tenant to collect for damages. However, if a seizing agency satisfies a landlord's claim under subsection (2) of this section, the rights the landlord has against the tenant for damages directly caused by an employee, agent, or officer of the seizing agency under the terms of the landlord and tenant's contract are subrogated to the seizing agency.

## Section 4
When property is forfeited under this chapter, the seizing agency may, after satisfying any court-ordered restitution:

1. Retain it for official use or upon application by any law enforcement agency of this state release such property to such agency to be used in enforcement;

2. Sell that which is not required to be destroyed by law and which is not harmful to the public;

3. Request the appropriate sheriff or director of public safety to take custody of the property and remove it for disposition in accordance with law;

4. Forward it to an appropriate entity, such as the drug enforcement administration, for disposition; or

5. Take any other action allowed by statute.

## Section 5
1. [Empty]

    a. [Empty]

        i. Except as provided in (a)(ii) of this subsection, by January 31st of each year, each seizing agency shall remit to the state treasurer an amount equal to 10 percent of the net proceeds of any property forfeited during the preceding calendar year. Money remitted shall be deposited in the state general fund unless otherwise provided in statute.

        ii. By January 31st of each year, each seizing agency shall remit to the state an amount equal to 10 percent of the net proceeds of any property forfeited under RCW 10.105.010 and 46.61.5058 during the preceding calendar year for deposit into the behavioral health loan repayment program account created in RCW 28B.115.135 through June 30, 2027, and into the state general fund thereafter.

    b. The net proceeds of forfeited property is the value of the forfeitable interest in the property after deducting the cost of satisfying any bona fide security interest to which the property is subject at the time of seizure; and in the case of sold property, after deducting the cost of sale, including reasonable fees or commissions paid to independent selling agents, and the cost of any valid landlord's claim for damages under section 3 of this act.

    c. The value of sold forfeited property is the sale price. The value of retained forfeited property is the fair market value of the property at the time of seizure, determined when possible by reference to an applicable commonly used index, such as the index used by the department of licensing for valuation of motor vehicles. A seizing agency may use, but need not use, an independent qualified appraiser to determine the value of retained property. If an appraiser is used, the value of the property appraised is net of the cost of the appraisal. The value of destroyed property and retained firearms or illegal property is zero.

2. Forfeited property and net proceeds not required to be paid to the state shall be retained by the seizing agency exclusively for the expansion and improvement of related enforcement activities. Money retained under this section may not be used to supplant preexisting funding sources.

## Section 6
The following are subject to seizure and forfeiture:

1. All visual or printed matter that depicts a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct.

    a. No conveyance used by any person as a common carrier in the transaction of business as a common carrier is subject to forfeiture under this section unless it appears that the owner or other person in charge of the conveyance is a consenting party or privy to a violation of this chapter;

    b. No property is subject to forfeiture under this section by reason of any act or omission  committed or omitted without the owner's knowledge or consent;

    c. A forfeiture of property encumbered by a bona fide security interest is subject to the interest of the secured party if the secured party neither had knowledge of nor consented to the act or omission; and

    d. When the owner of a conveyance has been arrested under this chapter the conveyance may not be subject to forfeiture unless it is seized or process is issued for its seizure within ten days of the owner's arrest.

3. All personal property, moneys, negotiable instruments, securities, or other tangible or intangible property furnished or intended to be furnished by any person in exchange for visual or printed matter depicting a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct, or constituting proceeds traceable to any violation of this chapter.

4. Property subject to forfeiture under this chapter may be seized by any law enforcement officer of this state upon process issued by any superior court having jurisdiction over the property. Seizure without process may be made if:

    a. The seizure is incident to an arrest or a search under a search warrant or an inspection under an administrative inspection warrant;

    b. The property subject to seizure has been the subject of a prior judgment in favor of the state in a criminal injunction or forfeiture proceeding based upon this chapter;

However:

        i. No property may be forfeited pursuant to this subsection (1)(g), to the extent of the interest of an owner, by reason of any act or omission committed or omitted without the owner's knowledge or consent;

When a vehicle is forfeited under this chapter the seizing law enforcement agency may sell the vehicle, retain it for official use, or upon application by a law enforcement agency of this state release the vehicle to that agency for the exclusive use of enforcing this title; provided, however, that the agency shall first satisfy any bona fide security interest to which the vehicle is subject under subsection (1)(a) or (c) of this section.

6. When a vehicle is forfeited, the seizing agency shall keep a record indicating the identity of the prior owner, if known, a description of the vehicle, the disposition of the vehicle, the value of the vehicle at the time of seizure, and the amount of proceeds realized from disposition of the vehicle.

7. Each seizing agency shall retain records of forfeited vehicles for at least seven years.

## Section 12
1. Explosives, improvised devices, and components of explosives and improvised devices that are possessed, manufactured, delivered, imported, exported, stored, sold, purchased, transported, abandoned, detonated, or used, or intended to be used, in violation of a provision of this chapter are subject to seizure and forfeiture by a law enforcement agency and no property right exists in them.

2. The law enforcement agency making the seizure shall notify the Washington state department of labor and industries of the seizure.

3. Seizure of explosives, improvised devices, and components of explosives and improvised devices under subsection (1) of this section may be made if:

    a. The seizure is incident to arrest or a search under a search warrant;

    b. The explosives, improvised devices, or components have been the subject of a prior judgment in favor of the state in an injunction or forfeiture proceeding based upon this chapter;

    c. A law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that the explosives, improvised devices, or components are directly or indirectly dangerous to health or safety; or

    d. The law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that the explosives, improvised devices, or components were used or were intended to be used in violation of this chapter.

4. A law enforcement agency shall destroy explosives seized under this chapter when it is necessary to protect the public safety and welfare. When destruction is not necessary to protect the public safety and welfare, and the explosives are not being held for evidence, a seizure pursuant to this section commences proceedings for forfeiture, which proceedings are governed by chapter 7.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 16 of this act).

5.

If the items seized are forfeited under this statute, the seizing agency shall dispose of the explosives by summary destruction. However, when explosives are destroyed either to protect public safety or because the explosives were forfeited, the person from whom the explosives were seized loses all rights of action against the law enforcement agency or its employees acting within the scope of their employment, or other governmental entity or employee involved with the seizure and destruction of explosives.

6. This section is not intended to change the seizure and forfeiture powers, enforcement, and penalties available to the department of labor and industries pursuant to chapter 49.17 RCW as provided in RCW 70.74.390.

## Section 13
1. Fish and wildlife officers and ex officio fish and wildlife officers may seize without warrant boats, airplanes, vehicles, motorized implements, conveyances, gear, appliances, or other articles they have probable cause to believe have been held with intent to violate or used in violation of this title or rule of the commission or director. However, fish and wildlife officers or ex officio fish and wildlife officers may not seize any item or article, other than for evidence, if under the circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that the violation was inadvertent. The property seized is subject to forfeiture to the state under this section regardless of ownership. Property seized may be recovered by its owner by depositing with the department or into court a cash bond or equivalent security equal to the value of the seized property but not more than one hundred thousand dollars. Such cash bond or security is subject to forfeiture in lieu of the property. Forfeiture of property seized under this section is a civil forfeiture against property and is intended to be a remedial civil sanction.

2. In the event of a seizure of property under this section, jurisdiction to begin the forfeiture proceedings shall commence upon seizure, and shall be governed by chapter 7.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 16 of this act).

3. If seized property is forfeited under this section the department may retain it for official use unless the property is required to be destroyed, or upon application by any law enforcement agency of the state, release such property to the agency for the use of enforcing this title, or sell such property, and deposit the proceeds to the fish and wildlife enforcement reward account created in RCW 77.15.425.
