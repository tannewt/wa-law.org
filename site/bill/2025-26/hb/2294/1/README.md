    b. Includes a private agreement limiting the size of a grocery store or pharmacy; and

    b. An agreement that imposes a negative use restriction to prohibit or restrict use of real property for a grocery store or pharmacy after an owner or operator of a grocery store or pharmacy discontinues operations of the grocery store or pharmacy on the property for the purpose of relocating the grocery store or pharmacy, if the following conditions are met:

        i. When compared to the discontinued store, the relocated store or pharmacy is similar in size or larger and similar in the scope of products sold;

        i. Except as provided in (c)(ii) of this subsection, an agreement that imposes a negative use restriction to prohibit or restrict use of real property for a grocery store or pharmacy in order to limit competition or conflicting uses within the confines of a retail center by allowing only a limited number of grocery stores or pharmacies within the retail center.

        ii. It remains unlawful for any owner or operator who discontinues grocery store or pharmacy use at a site within a retail center for a period exceeding one year, or the time period under section 3 of this act, to seek to enforce a negative use restriction prohibiting or restricting grocery store or pharmacy uses within the retail center.

## Section 3
1. A city, town, or county may establish that upon the written request of an owner or operator and the requestor's presentation of evidence establishing extenuating circumstances that demonstrate good cause for the extension, the city, town, or county may, by written determination, extend the following as they apply to the requestor:
