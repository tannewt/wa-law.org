# HB 1239 - Reentry readiness/DOC

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1239-S.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature recognizes that reentry readiness reduces recidivism, reducing the harm to individuals, families, and communities. The state of Washington has committed to reducing recidivism and increasing reentry readiness by joining and pledging to support the national reentry 2030 initiative.

The legislature recognizes that an equitable incentive in the form of earned release time incentivizes behaviors which lead to reentry readiness, while also addressing existing racial inequities in earned time and graduated reentry.

Through the reentry readiness act, the legislature intends to align public policy with the goals of the Washington statewide reentry council and the principles of the Washington way program.

The legislature recognizes that the availability of earned time is the most effective means of incentivizing participation in rehabilitative programming, which is critical for the purposes of increasing public safety and improving reentry outcomes.

The legislature further recognizes that histories of sexual violence and intimate partner violence are extraordinarily high among incarcerated women. The legislature recognizes that trauma from these types of victimization often contribute to the behaviors that result in incarceration. The legislature intends to address this trauma through establishment of a survivor and recovery-informed pilot program at the Washington corrections center for women.

## Section 2
1. [Empty]

    a. The term of the sentence of an offender committed to a correctional facility operated by the department may be reduced by earned release time in accordance with procedures that shall be developed and adopted by the correctional agency having jurisdiction in which the offender is confined. The earned release time shall be for good behavior and good performance, as determined by the correctional agency having jurisdiction. The correctional agency may calculate but shall not credit the offender with earned release credits in advance of the offender actually earning the credits.

    b. Any program established pursuant to this section shall allow an offender to earn earned release time credits for presentence incarceration. If an offender is transferred from a county jail to the department, the administrator of a county jail facility shall certify to the department the amount of time spent in custody at the facility and the number of days of earned release time credits lost or not earned. The department may approve a jail certification from a correctional agency that calculates earned release time based on the actual amount of confinement time served by the offender before sentencing when an erroneous calculation of confinement time served by the offender before sentencing appears on the judgment and sentence. The department must adjust an offender's rate of earned release time listed on the jail certification to be consistent with the rate applicable to offenders in the department's facilities. However, the department is not authorized to adjust the amount of presentence earned release time that the jail has certified as lost or not earned.

The department's authority under this section is independent of any court-ordered condition of sentence or statutory provision regarding conditions for community custody;

    d. If the department is unable to approve the offender's release plan, the department may do one or more of the following:

        i. Transfer an offender to partial confinement in lieu of earned early release for a period not to exceed three months. The three months in partial confinement is in addition to that portion of the offender's term of confinement that may be served in partial confinement as provided in RCW 9.94A.728(1)(e);

        ii. Provide rental vouchers to the offender for a period not to exceed six months if rental assistance will result in an approved release plan.

To be provided with appropriate employer intercession services to ensure that employers of victims, survivors of victims, and witnesses of crime will cooperate with the criminal justice process or the civil commitment process under chapter 10.77 or 71.09 RCW in order to minimize an employee's loss of pay and other benefits resulting from court appearance;

    j. To have access to immediate medical assistance and not to be detained for an unreasonable length of time by a law enforcement agency before having such assistance administered.

The role of the crime victim advocate is to provide emotional support to the crime victim;

    l. With respect to victims of violent offenses, domestic violence, or sex offenses, such victims may attend court proceedings or required interviews in person or remotely, including by video or other electronic means, as available in the local jurisdiction, to ensure access to justice to participate in criminal justice proceedings;

2. If a victim, survivor of a victim, or witness of a crime is denied a right under this section, the person may seek an order directing compliance by the relevant party or parties by filing a petition in the superior court in the county in which the crime occurred and providing notice of the petition to the relevant party or parties. Compliance with the right is the sole available remedy. The court shall expedite consideration of a petition filed under this subsection.
