<p>It is the intent of the legislature to vest in the department the power to provide for a comprehensive  work program and to remove statutory and other restrictions which have limited work programs in the past. It is also the intent of the legislature to ensure that the department, in developing and selecting correctional industries work programs, does not encourage the development of, or provide for selection of or contracting for, or the significant expansion of, any new or existing class I correctional industries work programs that unfairly compete with Washington businesses. The legislature intends that the requirements relating to fair competition in the correctional industries work programs be liberally construed by the department to protect Washington businesses from unfair competition. For purposes of establishing such a comprehensive program, the legislature recommends that the department consider adopting any or all, or any variation of, the following classes of work programs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>CLASS I: FREE VENTURE INDUSTRIES.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The employer model industries in this class shall be operated and managed in total or in part by any profit or nonprofit organization pursuant to an agreement between the organization and the department.

</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall review these proposed industries, including any potential new class I industries work program or the significant expansion of an existing class I industries work program, before the department contracts to provide such products or services. The review shall include the analysis required under RCW 72.09.115 to determine if the proposed correctional industries work program will compete with any Washington business. An agreement for a new class I correctional industries work program, or an agreement for a significant expansion of an existing class I correctional industries work program, that unfairly competes with any Washington business is prohibited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall supply appropriate security and custody services without charge to the participating firms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incarcerated persons who work in free venture industries shall do so at their own choice. They shall be paid a wage comparable to the wage paid for work of a similar nature in the locality in which the industry is located, as determined by the director of correctional industries. If the director cannot reasonably determine the comparable wage, then the pay shall not be less than the federal minimum wage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An incarcerated person who is employed in the class I program of correctional industries shall not be eligible for unemployment compensation benefits pursuant to any of the provisions of Title 50 RCW until released on parole or discharged.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The industries selected for development within this class shall, as much as possible, match the available pool of incarcerated person work skills and aptitudes with the work opportunities in the free community. The industries shall be closely patterned after private sector industries but with the objective of reducing public support costs rather than making a profit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in RCW 39.26.251(2) and this section, the products and services of this industry, including purchased products and services necessary for a complete product line, may be sold to the following:</p>

    i. Class II correctional industries products and services shall be reviewed by the department before offering such products and services for sale to private contractors.

    ii. The secretary shall conduct a yearly marketing review of the products and services offered under this subsection. Such review shall include an analysis of the potential impact of the proposed products and services on the Washington state business community. To avoid waste or spoilage and consequent loss to the state, when there is no public sector market for such goods, by-products and surpluses of timber, agricultural, and animal husbandry enterprises may be sold to private persons, at private sale. Surplus by-products and surpluses of timber, agricultural and animal husbandry enterprises that cannot be sold to public agencies or to private persons may be donated to nonprofit organizations. All sales of surplus products shall be carried out in accordance with rules prescribed by the secretary.

e. Security and custody services shall be provided without charge by the department.

f. Incarcerated persons working in this class of industries shall do so at their own choice and shall be paid for their work on a gratuity scale which shall not exceed the wage paid for work of a similar nature in the locality in which the industry is located and which is approved by the director of correctional industries, provided that the payment is no less than $1.00 per hour.

g. Provisions of RCW 41.06.142 shall not apply to contracts with Washington state businesses entered into by the department through class II industries.

<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The department shall adopt, by rule, a system that clearly links an incarcerated person's behavior and participation in available education and work programs with the receipt or denial of earned early release days and other privileges. The system shall include increases or decreases in the degree of liberty granted the incarcerated person within the programs operated by the department, access to or withholding of privileges available within correctional institutions, and recommended increases or decreases in the number of earned early release days that an incarcerated person can earn for good conduct and good performance, except that an incarcerated person's earned early release and other privileges may not be reduced based on the person's choice to not participate in work programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Earned early release days shall be recommended by the department as a reward for accomplishment. The system shall be fair, measurable, and understandable to incarcerated persons, staff, and the public. At least once in each 12-month period, the department shall inform the incarcerated person in writing as to his or her conduct and performance. This written evaluation shall include reasons for awarding or not awarding recommended earned early release days for good conduct and good performance. An incarcerated person is not eligible to receive earned early release days during any time in which he or she refuses to participate in an available education  program into which he or she has been placed under RCW 72.09.460. An incarcerated person's earned early release days may not be reduced based on the person's choice to not participate in work programs.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Recognizing that there is a positive correlation between education opportunities and reduced recidivism, it is the intent of the legislature to offer appropriate postsecondary degree or certificate opportunities to incarcerated individuals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends that all incarcerated individuals be required to participate in department-approved education programs,  unless exempted as specifically provided in this section. Eligible incarcerated individuals who refuse to participate in available education  programs available at no charge to the incarcerated individuals shall lose privileges according to the system established under RCW 72.09.130; however, an incarcerated person's choice to not participate in a work program may not result in loss of privileges pursuant to section 6 of this act. Eligible incarcerated individuals who are required to contribute financially to an education or work program and refuse to contribute shall be placed in another work program. Refusal to contribute shall not result in a loss of privileges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes more incarcerated individuals may agree to participate in education and work programs than are available. The department must make every effort to achieve maximum public benefit by placing incarcerated individuals in available and appropriate education and work programs.</p>

<p>If programming is provided pursuant to (a)(i) through (iii) of this subsection, the department shall pay the cost of such programming, including but not limited to books, materials, and supplies for adult basic education programs and any postsecondary education program that is not financial aid eligible at the time the individual is enrolled or paid for by the department or third party.</p>

<li>
<p>For financial aid eligible postsecondary programming provided pursuant to (a)(i) through (iii) of this subsection, the department may require the individual to apply for any federal and state financial aid grants available to the individual as a condition of participation in such programming. The individual may elect to use available financial aid grants, self-pay, or any other available third-party funding, or use a combination of these methods to cover the cost of attendance for financial aid eligible postsecondary programming provided under this subsection (4)(b)(ii). If an individual elects to self-pay or utilize third-party funding, the individual is not subject to the postaward formula described in (c) of this subsection. If the cost of attendance exceeds any financial grant awards that may be available to the individual, or the person is not eligible for federal or state financial aid grants, the department shall pay the cost of attendance not otherwise covered by third-party funding. All regulations and requirements set forth by the United States department of education for federal pell grants for prison education programs apply to financial aid eligible postsecondary programming.</p>

<li>
<p>If programming is provided pursuant to (a)(iv) of this subsection, incarcerated individuals shall be required to pay all or a portion of the costs, including books, fees, and tuition, for participation in any vocational, work, or education program as provided in department policies.

If the individual is not eligible for federal financial aid grants, the individual may apply for and utilize state financial aid grants available to the individual. Department policies shall include a postaward formula for determining how much an incarcerated individual shall be required to pay after deducting any amount from available financial aid or other available sources. The postaward formula shall include steps which correlate to an incarcerated individual's average monthly income or average available balance in a personal savings account and which are correlated to a prorated portion or percent of the per credit fee for tuition, books, or other ancillary educational costs. Any postaward formula offsets and funds paid for by the department for educational programming shall not result in the reduction of any gift aid. The postaward formula shall be reviewed every two years. A third party, including but not limited to nonprofit entities or community-based postsecondary education programs, may pay directly to the department all or a portion of costs and tuition for any programming provided pursuant to (a)(iv) of this subsection on behalf of an incarcerated individual. Such payments shall not be subject to any of the deductions as provided in this chapter.</p>

<li>
<p>All incarcerated individuals shall receive financial aid and academic advising from an accredited institution of higher education prior to enrollment in a financial aid eligible postsecondary education program.

The program of education established by the department and education provider under RCW 28A.193.020 for incarcerated individuals under the age of eighteen must provide each incarcerated individual a choice of curriculum that will assist the incarcerated individual in achieving a high school diploma or high school equivalency certificate. The program of education may include but not be limited to basic education, prevocational training, work ethic skills, conflict resolution counseling, substance abuse intervention, and anger management counseling.
