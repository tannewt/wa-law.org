<p>Within two weeks of the date charges are filed and upon agreement of the prosecutor the person must enter into an agreement with the prosecutor to pursue the juvenile firearm early intervention alternative in lieu of prosecution.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A juvenile firearm early intervention alternative must consist of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">

</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a" start="5">
<li>

<p>If the participant successfully completes the alternative, the charge must be dismissed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it appears to the prosecuting attorney that the participant is not substantially complying with all alternative conditions as reflected by a written update, the prosecuting attorney may make a motion for termination of the alternative.</p>
