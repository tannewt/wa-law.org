The participant signing a consent to allow for random, suspicionless searches of their person, vehicle, residence, and personal property during the period of supervision in order to allow the juvenile probation officer to search for firearms, firearm parts, ammunition, illegal substances, or other items that would constitute a violation of state law or the terms of the alternative;

    e. The participant agreeing that the juvenile probation officer has the authority to arrest the participant, or cause the arrest of the participant without a warrant when the probation officer has probable cause to believe the participant has violated a condition of the alternative and there is a risk to public safety or to the health and welfare of the participant, pending a court hearing that considers the nature of the alleged violation or violations;
