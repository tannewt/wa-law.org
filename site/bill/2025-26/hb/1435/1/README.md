Any additional costs for salaries and benefits higher than entry level are the responsibility of the grant recipient agency. The grants cannot be used for any costs other than salaries and benefits. These grants are intended for the purpose of increasing the number of filled local and tribal law enforcement officer positions in Washington state. Grants shall not be awarded for any local or tribal law enforcement position if the applicant is, or has been within the previous 12 calendar months, employed by a local or tribal law enforcement agency in Washington state.
