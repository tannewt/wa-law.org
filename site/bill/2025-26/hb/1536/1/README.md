# HB 1536 - Juveniles/firearm possession

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1536.pdf)

## Section 1
1. Firearm violence disproportionately impacts marginalized young people, including BIPOC and low-income communities, both as victims and as respondents. Intervening early when a young person is found to be in possession of a firearm is a critical opportunity to avoid juveniles becoming a future victim of gun violence or committing a more serious crime that will further entrench them in the criminal justice system.

2. The legislature intends to enhance legal interventions available to provide necessary accountability for young people found to possess firearms and to incentivize behavior change, including through evidence-based behavioral health interventions, so these young people do not commit greater harm to themselves or the community.

## Section 2
1. [Empty]

    a. A person, whether an adult or juvenile, is guilty of the crime of unlawful possession of a firearm in the first degree, if the person owns, accesses, has in the person's custody, control, or possession, or receives any firearm after having previously been convicted or found not guilty by reason of insanity in this state or elsewhere of any serious offense.

    b. A juvenile is guilty of the crime of unlawful possession of a firearm in the first degree if the juvenile owns, accesses, has in the juvenile's custody, control, or possession, or receives any firearm after having previously been adjudicated, convicted, or found not guilty by reason of insanity in this state of subsection (2)(a)(v) of this section or a comparable out-of-state offense.

    c. Unlawful possession of a firearm in the first degree is a class B felony punishable according to chapter 9A.20 RCW.

6. Nothing in chapter 129, Laws of 1995 shall ever be construed or interpreted as preventing an offender from being charged and subsequently convicted for the separate felony crimes of theft of a firearm or possession of a stolen firearm, or both, in addition to being charged and subsequently convicted under this section for unlawful possession of a firearm in the first or second degree. Notwithstanding any other law, if the offender is convicted under this section for unlawful possession of a firearm in the first or second degree and for the felony crimes of theft of a firearm or possession of a stolen firearm, or both, then the offender shall serve consecutive sentences for each of the felony crimes of conviction listed in this subsection.

7. [Empty]

ADJUDICATIONS

NOTE: References in the grid to days or weeks mean periods of confinement. "LS" means "local sanctions" as defined in RCW 13.40.020.

1. The vertical axis of the grid is the current offense category. The current offense category is determined by the offense of adjudication.

2. The horizontal axis of the grid is the number of prior adjudications included in the juvenile's criminal history. Each prior felony adjudication shall count as one point. Each prior violation, misdemeanor, and gross misdemeanor adjudication shall count as 1/4 point. Fractional points shall be rounded down.

3. The standard range disposition for each offense is determined by the intersection of the column defined by the prior adjudications and the row defined by the current offense category.

4. RCW 13.40.180 applies if the offender is being sentenced for more than one offense.

5. A current offense that is a violation is equivalent to an offense category of E. However, a disposition for a violation shall not include confinement.

1. If the offender is subject to a standard range disposition involving confinement by the department, the court may impose the standard range and suspend the disposition on condition that the offender comply with one or more local sanctions and any educational or treatment requirement. The treatment programs provided to the offender must be either research-based best practice programs as identified by the Washington state institute for public policy or the joint legislative audit and review committee, or for chemical dependency treatment programs or services, they must be evidence-based or research-based best practice programs. For the purposes of this subsection:

    a. "Evidence-based" means a program or practice that has had multiple site random controlled trials across heterogeneous populations demonstrating that the program or practice is effective for the population; and

    b. "Research-based" means a program or practice that has some research demonstrating effectiveness, but that does not yet meet the standard of evidence-based practices.

2. If the offender fails to comply with the suspended disposition, the court may impose sanctions pursuant to RCW 13.40.200 or may revoke the suspended disposition and order the disposition's execution.

3. An offender is ineligible for the suspended disposition option under this section if the offender:

    a. Is adjudicated of an A+ or A++ offense;

    b. Is fourteen years of age or older and is adjudicated of one or more of the following offenses:

        i. A class A offense, or an attempt, conspiracy, or solicitation to commit a class A offense;

        ii. Manslaughter in the first degree (RCW 9A.32.060);

        iii. Assault in the second degree (RCW 9A.36.021), extortion in the first degree (RCW 9A.56.120), kidnapping in the second degree (RCW 9A.40.030), drive-by shooting (RCW 9A.36.045), vehicular homicide (RCW 46.61.520), hit and run death (RCW 46.52.020(4)(a)), or manslaughter 2 (RCW 9A.32.070); or

        iv. Violation of the uniform controlled substances act (RCW 69.50.401(2) (a) and (b)), when the offense includes infliction of bodily harm upon another or when during the commission or immediate withdrawal from the offense the respondent was armed with a deadly weapon;

    c. Is ordered to serve a disposition for a firearm violation under RCW 13.40.193;

    d. Is adjudicated of a sex offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030; or

    e. Has a prior option B disposition.

If the juvenile offender is subject to a standard range disposition of local sanctions or 15 to 36 weeks of confinement and has not committed a B++ or B+ offense, the court may impose a disposition under RCW 13.40.160(4) and 13.40.165.

If the court determines that a disposition under option A, B, or C would effectuate a manifest injustice, the court shall impose a disposition outside the standard range under RCW 13.40.160(2).
