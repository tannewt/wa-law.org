</li>
<li>
<p>If a notarial act is performed under this section, the certificate of notarial act required by RCW 42.45.130 and the short form certificate provided in RCW 42.45.140 must indicate that the notarial act was performed using communication technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A short form certificate provided in RCW 42.45.140 for a notarial act subject to this section is sufficient if it:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Complies with rules adopted under subsection (13)(a) of this section; or</p>

<p>An electronic records notary public, a guardian, conservator, or agent of an electronic records notary public, or a personal representative of a deceased electronic records notary public shall retain the audiovisual recording created under subsection (3)(c) of this section or cause the recording to be retained by a repository designated by or on behalf of the person required to retain the recording. Unless a different period is required by rule adopted under subsection (13)(d) of this section, the recording must be retained for a period of at least ten years after the recording is made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before an electronic records notary public performs the electronic records notary public's initial notarial act under this section, the electronic records notary public must notify the director that the electronic records notary public will be performing notarial acts and identify the technologies the electronic records notary public intends to use. If the director has established standards under subsection (13) of this section and RCW 42.45.250 for approval of communication technology or identity proofing, the communication technology and identity proofing must conform to the standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to adopting rules under RCW 42.45.250, the director may adopt rules under this section regarding performance of a notarial act. The rules may:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Prescribe the means of performing a notarial act involving a remotely located individual using communication technology;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish standards for communication technology and identity proofing;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish requirements or procedures to approve providers of communication technology and the process of identity proofing;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish standards and a period for the retention of an audiovisual recording created under subsection (3)(c) of this section; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prescribe methods for an electronic records notary public to confirm under subsections (4) and (5) of this section the identity of a tangible record.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before adopting, amending, or repealing a rule governing performance of a notarial act with respect to a remotely located individual, the director must consider:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The most recent standards regarding the performance of a notarial act with respect to a remotely located individual adopted by national standard-setting organizations and the recommendations of the national association of secretaries of state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standards, practices, and customs of other jurisdictions that have laws substantially similar to this section; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The views of governmental officials and entities and other interested persons.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>By allowing its communication technology or identity proofing to facilitate a notarial act for a remotely located individual or by providing storage of the audiovisual recording under subsection (3)(c) of this section, the provider of the communication technology, identity proofing, or storage appoints the director as the provider's agent for service of process in any civil action in this state related to the notarial act.</p>
</li>
