<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the workforce crisis is impacting vital occupations such as firefighters, nurses, servicemembers, police officers, and mental health professionals particularly hard. These occupations are critical to the quality of life and well-being of all Washingtonians.</p>
<p>The legislature also recognizes the ongoing housing crisis that has put homeownership out of reach for many. Median home prices have been increasing dramatically over the past decade and increased by 23.9 percent alone in 2020. This housing crisis is a deterrent for many health care professionals, law enforcement, social workers, and other vital providers to accept recruitment opportunities in Washington state.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature finds that it is necessary to provide additional down payment assistance to targeted occupations to encourage relocation to and homeownership in Washington state. It is the intent of this act to help more heroes find homes.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The department shall contract with the housing finance commission to design, develop, implement, and evaluate a statewide pilot program to provide down payment and closing cost assistance to people who work in targeted occupations and meet income requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By December 1, 2025, the pilot program must provide loans to income-eligible workers in targeted occupations for down payment and closing costs for the purchase of a primary residence. Loans may not exceed five percent of the first mortgage on the residence or $25,000, whichever is less. Loans must be made available with no interest. A pilot program participant may not be required to repay the loan until the first mortgage is paid in full or the property is sold, refinanced, rented, or transferred.</p>
