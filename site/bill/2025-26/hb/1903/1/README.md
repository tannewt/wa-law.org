# HB 1903 - Low-income energy assistance

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1903.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that there is an urgent need for stronger policy and a new program option to secure universally accessible low-income energy bill assistance and reduce the over $270,000,000 biennial energy burden in Washington. Many income-eligible households do not have sufficient support. The department of commerce November 2024 study of options for a statewide energy assistance program in Washington lays out core features of a just system to expand and secure access to energy affordability measures. To address present and widening disparities in household access to energy assistance will require easier applications, safe data sharing, low barrier eligibility determinations, systematic processes for filling in gaps in the reach of existing programs, and guaranteed funding sources. The recommended program design promotes a more centralized approach to energy assistance. Key elements include those that reduce administrative burdens, but also improve the experience and likelihood that an eligible household receives assistance.

## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout sections 3 and 4 of this act unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Low-income" has the same meaning as in RCW 19.405.020.

2. "Community action council" has the same meaning as "community action agency" in RCW 43.185C.010.

3. "Energy assistance" means monetary assistance, such as a grant program or discounts for low-income households, that lowers a low-income household's energy burden.

4. "Energy burden" has the same meaning as in RCW 19.405.020.

## Section 3
1. The statewide low-income energy assistance program is established within the department. The purpose of the program is to reduce energy burden for low-income households in Washington. The department must begin providing energy assistance through the program by July 1, 2026. The department must write rules to implement this section.

2. The department must establish enrollment details which must include, but are not limited to:

    a. All low-income households are eligible to participate in the program;

    b. Low-income households may apply directly to the program;

    c. Low-income households may self-attest that they meet income qualifications;

    d. The department may verify that applicants and participants meet the income qualifications, and may work with utilities and community action councils to conduct this verification;

    e. There is no risk to eligibility based on immigration status or income self-attestation; and

    f. The department must explore auto-enrollment of known eligible households.

3. The department must provide outreach for the program by:

    a. Developing a website and materials for the program that provide information in multiple languages. Outreach materials must be produced and approved by first language speakers;

    b. Partnering with community-based organizations and community action councils to provide outreach to households less likely to sign up directly or seek government services;

    c. Coordinating with programs in the state that provide benefits to low-income households so that low-income households are notified and directed to the statewide low-income energy assistance program when signing up or participating in other programs. These programs may include, but are not limited to, the food stamp or benefit program as authorized in RCW 74.04.500 and the working families tax credit as described in RCW 82.08.0206;

    d. Providing a call center;

    a. In accordance with section 5 of this act, the department must administer the program by providing funds for energy assistance to gas and electric companies, and to all other electric utilities. The utilities must pass these funds on to their low-income residential customers and show the energy assistance on the customers' monthly bills.

    b. The dollar amount that the department must provide to low-income households must be tiered to provide the most energy assistance to the households with the greatest need.

    c. The department's obligation to provide energy assistance is based on available funding appropriated for this specific purpose. It is the intent of the legislature that sustained funding shall be provided to meet low-income household needs from climate commitment act auction revenues.

5. The department must submit a report to the governor and legislature that includes a program evaluation of the statewide low-income energy assistance program by July 1st in every even-numbered year. The advisory group established in section 4 of this act must advise the department on the program evaluation, which must include meaningful metrics around equitable access and overall program delivery.

## Section 4
The department must establish an advisory group for the statewide low-income energy assistance program, which must include, but is not limited to, members from low-income households. The advisory group must be composed of a diverse group of stakeholders and must be established by the department before program implementation to help inform program development. The advisory group must advise the department throughout program implementation and on the program evaluation required in section 3 of this act.

## Section 5
1. Gas companies and electric companies must either participate in the statewide low-income energy assistance program established in section 3 of this act or opt-out in accordance with subsection (2) of this section.

2. A gas company or electric company may opt-out of the statewide low-income energy assistance program if it has at least one low-income program that provides energy assistance to at least 50 percent of low-income households served by the utility and maintains this participation percent. For an electric company, such a program or programs must follow the requirements outlined in RCW 19.405.120.

2. An electric utility must make programs and funding available for energy assistance to low-income households by July 31, 2021, which the utility may either do directly and in accordance with the requirements described in this section or through the statewide low-income energy assistance program described in section 3 of this act. An electric utility's participation in the statewide low-income energy assistance program satisfies compliance with this section.

3. Each utility must demonstrate progress in providing energy assistance pursuant to the assessment and plans in subsection (5) of this section. To the extent practicable, priority must be given to low-income households with a higher energy burden.

4. Beginning July 31, 2020, the department must collect and aggregate data estimating the energy burden and energy assistance need and reported energy assistance for each electric utility, in order to improve agency and utility efforts to serve low-income households with energy assistance.
