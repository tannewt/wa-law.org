<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that there is an urgent need for stronger policy and a new program option to secure universally accessible low-income energy bill assistance and reduce the over $270,000,000 biennial energy burden in Washington. Many income-eligible households do not have sufficient support. The department of commerce November 2024 study of options for a statewide energy assistance program in Washington lays out core features of a just system to expand and secure access to energy affordability measures. To address present and widening disparities in household access to energy assistance will require easier applications, safe data sharing, low barrier eligibility determinations, systematic processes for filling in gaps in the reach of existing programs, and guaranteed funding sources. The recommended program design promotes a more centralized approach to energy assistance. Key elements include those that reduce administrative burdens, but also improve the experience and likelihood that an eligible household receives assistance.</p>
