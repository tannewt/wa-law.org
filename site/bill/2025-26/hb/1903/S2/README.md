# HB 1903 - Low-income energy assistance

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1903-S2.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that there is an urgent need for stronger policy and a new program option to secure universally accessible low-income energy bill assistance and reduce the $275,000,000 annual energy burden in Washington. Many income-eligible households do not have sufficient support. The department of commerce November 2024 study of options for a statewide energy assistance program in Washington lays out core features of a just system to expand and secure access to energy affordability measures. To address present and widening disparities in household access to energy assistance will require easier applications, safe data sharing, low barrier eligibility determinations, systematic processes for filling in gaps in the reach of existing programs, and guaranteed funding sources. The recommended program design promotes a more centralized approach to energy assistance. Key elements include those that reduce administrative burdens, but also improve the experience and likelihood that an eligible household receives assistance.

2. It is the intent of the legislature for the department of commerce to phase in this program across utilities and home heating fuel types, prioritizing areas of the state with a disproportionate share of low-income households in energy assistance need and where low-income monthly bill assistance programs targeted at addressing energy assistance need are lacking.

## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout sections 3 and 4 of this act unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Low-income" has the same meaning as in RCW 19.405.020.

2. "Community action council" has the same meaning as "community action agency" in RCW 43.185C.010.

3. "Energy assistance" means monetary assistance, such as a grant program or discounts for low-income households, that lowers a low-income household's energy burden.

4. "Energy burden" has the same meaning as in RCW 19.405.020.

## Section 3
1. The statewide low-income energy assistance program is established within the department. The purpose of the program is to reduce energy burden for low-income households in Washington. The department must begin providing energy assistance through the program by October 1, 2027. The department, in consultation with the utilities and transportation commission, must write rules to implement this section.

2. In accordance with subsection (4) of this section, the department must establish enrollment details which must include, but are not limited to:

    a. All low-income households are eligible to participate in the program;

    b. Low-income households may apply directly to the program;

    c. Low-income households may apply to the utility from which they receive service if the utility has voluntarily chosen to serve as coadministrator of the program;

    d. Low-income households may apply through a community action council for state-funded energy assistance in partnership with the participating utility;

    e. Low-income households may self-attest that they meet income qualifications;

    f. The department may verify that applicants and participants meet the income qualifications, and may work with utilities and community action councils to conduct this verification;

    g. There is no risk to eligibility based on immigration status or income self-attestation; and

    h. The department must explore auto-enrollment of known eligible households.

3. The department may enter into agreements with utilities to serve as coadministrators of the statewide low-income energy assistance program for the purposes of enhancing customer engagement, facilitating enrollment of eligible customers, and sharing administrative duties with the department. Serving as a coadministrator is voluntary for utilities.

4. Subject to appropriation, the department must phase in the program across utilities and home heating fuel types, prioritizing areas of the state with a disproportionate share of low-income households in energy assistance need and where low-income monthly bill assistance programs targeted at addressing energy assistance need are lacking.

5. [Empty]

    a. The department must administer the program by providing funds to utilities that participate in the program. The utilities must pass these funds on to their low-income residential customers and show the energy assistance on the customers' monthly bills.

    b. [Empty]

        i. A utility with more than 25,000 customers in the state that participates in the program must provide energy assistance to customers and then seek reimbursement from the department equal to the energy assistance provided. The department must provide reimbursement within 30 days of receipt of a reimbursement request from the utility.

        ii. A utility serving up to 25,000 customers in the state that participates in the program may request that the department provide funds for energy assistance in advance of the utility providing the energy assistance to customers. The department may provide energy assistance upfront with appropriate contractual agreements.

    c. The discount or dollar amount that the department provides to low-income households must be tiered to provide the most energy assistance to the households with the greatest need.

    d. The department and each utility's obligation to provide energy assistance under the statewide program is based on available funding appropriated for this specific purpose. It is the intent of the legislature that sustained funding shall be provided to meet low-income household needs from climate commitment act auction revenues or other state general fund dollars.

    e. The department must ensure that benefit levels provided through the statewide low-income energy assistance program are not less than what a customer enrolled in their utility program received from their utility program in the previous year.

6. A utility participating in the statewide low-income energy assistance program may not reduce the level of low-income energy assistance, discounts, or affordability benefits it provided in the previous calendar year as a result of participation in the statewide program.

7. The department must submit a report to the governor and legislature that includes a program evaluation of the statewide low-income energy assistance program by July 1st in every even-numbered year. The advisory group established in section 4 of this act must advise the department on the program evaluation, which must include meaningful metrics around equitable access and overall program delivery.

## Section 4
The department must establish an advisory group for the statewide low-income energy assistance program, which must include, but is not limited to, members from low-income households. The advisory group must be composed of a diverse group of stakeholders and must be established by the department before program implementation to help inform program development. The advisory group must advise the department throughout program implementation and on the program evaluation required in section 3 of this act.
