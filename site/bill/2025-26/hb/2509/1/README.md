At least one member of the council shall have been admitted to practice law in this state and engaged in the legal profession at the time of the person's appointment.

2. The two additional members of the council:

    a. Shall be appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the senate;

    c. Shall be appointed for a term of six years and until their successors are appointed and have qualified. In case of a vacancy, it shall be filled by appointment by the governor for the unexpired portion of the term in which said vacancy occurs, except the terms of the first two additional members shall be staggered so that one member shall be appointed to serve until July 1, 2029, and the other until July 1, 2032;

    d. May be removed for inefficiency, malfeasance, and misfeasance in office, under specific written charges filed by the governor, who shall transmit such written charges to the member accused and to the chief justice of the supreme court. The chief justice shall thereupon designate a tribunal composed of three judges of the superior court to hear and adjudicate the charges. Such tribunal shall fix the time of the hearing, which shall be public, and the procedure for the hearing, and the decision of such tribunal shall be final and not subject to review by the supreme court. Removal of any member of the council by the tribunal shall disqualify such member for reappointment;

    g. For a period of one year after the termination of the person's membership on the council, shall not act in a representative capacity before the council on any matter.

3. A majority of the council pursuant to this section shall constitute a quorum for making recommendations for site certifications, promulgating rules and regulations necessary for the conduct of its powers and duties, or transacting other official business, and may act though one position of the council be vacant. One or more members may hold hearings and take testimony to be reported for action by the council when authorized by rule or order of the council. The council shall perform all the powers and duties specified in this chapter or as otherwise provided by law as they pertain to applications for an electrical transmission facility pursuant to RCW 80.50.060(1)(b)(iii) or 80.50.060(2)(a).

## Section 2

Compliance with such design and development standards shall be deemed to mitigate or avoid adverse impacts to a nonsignificant level under chapter 43.21C RCW for the aspects of the environment related to the applicable standard.

4. Application materials provided pursuant to this chapter that are determined to constitute a complete application shall also be deemed to be the full documentation required for the applicant to demonstrate compliance with RCW 43.21C.460 and shall be included by the council in their review and decision making under chapter 43.21C RCW.
