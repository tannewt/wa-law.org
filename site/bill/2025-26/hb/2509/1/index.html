<ol>
<li>
<p>When considering an application for an electrical transmission facility pursuant to RCW 80.50.060(1)(b)(iii) or 80.50.060(2)(a), the council shall consist of the chair of the council and two additional members who shall be qualified by experience or training in pertinent matters pertaining to environmental regulations, energy infrastructure siting, Washington land use practices, tribal consultation practices, and permitting. At least one member of the council shall have been admitted to practice law in this state and engaged in the legal profession at the time of the person's appointment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The two additional members of the council:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Shall be appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the senate;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shall not be a candidate for, nor hold any other public office or trust, and shall not engage in any occupation or business interfering with or inconsistent with the candidate's duty as a member of the council, nor shall he or she serve on or under any committee of any political party;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shall be appointed for a term of six years and until their successors are appointed and have qualified. In case of a vacancy, it shall be filled by appointment by the governor for the unexpired portion of the term in which said vacancy occurs, except the terms of the first two additional members shall be staggered so that one member shall be appointed to serve until July 1, 2029, and the other until July 1, 2032;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May be removed for inefficiency, malfeasance, and misfeasance in office, under specific written charges filed by the governor, who shall transmit such written charges to the member accused and to the chief justice of the supreme court. The chief justice shall thereupon designate a tribunal composed of three judges of the superior court to hear and adjudicate the charges. Such tribunal shall fix the time of the hearing, which shall be public, and the procedure for the hearing, and the decision of such tribunal shall be final and not subject to review by the supreme court. Removal of any member of the council by the tribunal shall disqualify such member for reappointment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shall be exempt from the application of Washington state civil service laws pursuant to RCW 41.06.070(1)(h)(i);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shall receive salaries set by the director on a review and analysis of the duties and responsibilities of the positions and in accordance with state law for exempt positions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a period of one year after the termination of the person's membership on the council, shall not act in a representative capacity before the council on any matter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A majority of the council pursuant to this section shall constitute a quorum for making recommendations for site certifications, promulgating rules and regulations necessary for the conduct of its powers and duties, or transacting other official business, and may act though one position of the council be vacant. One or more members may hold hearings and take testimony to be reported for action by the council when authorized by rule or order of the council. The council shall perform all the powers and duties specified in this chapter or as otherwise provided by law as they pertain to applications for an electrical transmission facility pursuant to RCW 80.50.060(1)(b)(iii) or 80.50.060(2)(a).</p>

<li>
<p>Applications for an electrical transmission facility made pursuant to RCW 80.50.060(1)(b)(iii) or 80.50.060(2)(a) shall not be required to hold a hearing pursuant to RCW 80.50.090(2), but must be reviewed in an adjudicative hearing pursuant to RCW 80.50.090(4) and chapter 34.05 RCW unless eligible for expedited processing under RCW 80.50.075. The council shall limit the topics of the adjudication to the project's potential for impacts to categories identified in subsection (2) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>The facility will be served by adequate public facilities including streets, fire protection, and utilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The facility will not be materially detrimental to uses or property in the immediate vicinity of the subject property;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The facility complies with applicable design and development standards required by this chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The design, use, and operation of the facility comply with applicable state and federal statutes; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proposal shall provide practicable mitigation for adverse environmental impacts caused by the proposal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The design and development standards applicable under subsection (2)(c) of this section shall be determined by council staff in coordination with the applicant within 90 days of the time of a complete application submission. Compliance with such design and development standards shall be deemed to mitigate or avoid adverse impacts to a nonsignificant level under chapter 43.21C RCW for the aspects of the environment related to the applicable standard.</p>

<li>
<p>Application materials provided pursuant to this chapter that are determined to constitute a complete application shall also be deemed to be the full documentation required for the applicant to demonstrate compliance with RCW 43.21C.460 and shall be included by the council in their review and decision making under chapter 43.21C RCW.</p>

The application for expedited processing shall be submitted to the council in such form and manner and accompanied by such information as may be prescribed by council rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The council must grant an applicant expedited processing of an application for certification for proposals for solar, onshore wind, electricity storage, and transmission line facilities, including accessory facilities required to bring those facilities to commercial operation that are included in the proposal, upon finding that:</p>
<ol type="a">
