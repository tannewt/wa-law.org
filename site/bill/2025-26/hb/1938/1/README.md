# HB 1938 - State flag redesign

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1938.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that the Washington state flag often faces criticism for its poor design and lack of relevance to the state's identity. The flag features a detailed portrait of George Washington, making it overly complex and difficult to reproduce which is a violation of key flag design principles that prioritize simplicity. Additionally, while George Washington is an important national figure, he has limited historical connection to the state itself. This makes his image less meaningful as a symbol for the state.

The legislature further finds that the flag fails in other ways aesthetically. It uses too many colors, and its design is essentially a seal on a green background with text. This is widely regarded as an outdated and uninspired approach to flag design. As one of 28 state flags in the United States that showcase a seal on a solid color, Washington's flag lacks distinctiveness and fails to capture the unique character of the state. The current flag, though historically significant, does not resonate with the state's evolving identity. The legislature intends to create the Washington state flag redesign committee that will oversee the process to design and adopt a state flag that symbolizes unity and represents the unique character of the state.

This section expires January 1, 2029.
