# HB 2661 - Public records task force

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2661.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds the public records act was enacted as part of a voter initiative and is the cornerstone of transparency and accountability in state and local government. The legislature reaffirms that broad public access to government records strengthens accountability, promotes civic engagement, and fosters confidence in public institutions. The legislature further finds that misuse of the public records act for frivolous, retaliatory, or harassing purposes strains limited public resources, delays access to records for individuals who use the public records request process for legitimate purposes, and does not advance the public interest in governmental transparency. The legislature therefore finds that it is necessary to establish a legislative task force on public records act modernization to examine ways to improve the functionality of the public records act that will increase efficiency, reduce the financial burden on state and local agencies, maintain transparency in government, and deter abuse of the public records request process.
