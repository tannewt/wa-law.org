These individuals who are not placed in a department of children, youth, and families facility must be notified upon placement in a department of corrections facility of the ability to request transfer according to this subsection and notified when the population of the department of children, youth, and families facility where they would have been placed is below 95 percent of the safe operational capacity as described in RCW 13.40.460(9) and there is more than one year remaining on the person's sentence that would be served in the department of children, youth, and families facility and given the option to request a transfer to a department of children, youth, and families facility. A person who is eligible for transfer to a department of children, youth, and families facility under this subsection has the right to counsel and the review board established under RCW 13.40.280 will determine whether a person's transfer request under this subsection will occur. The department of corrections shall determine the person's earned release date.</p>

<p>A person who is transferred to the custody of the department of corrections and reaches 18 years of age may remain in a housing unit for persons under the age of 18 if the secretary of corrections determines that: (i) The person's needs and the rehabilitation goals for the person could continue to be better met by the programs and housing environment that is separate from other persons in custody who are 18 years of age and older; and (ii) the programs or housing environment for persons under the age of 18 will not be substantially affected by the continued placement of the person in that environment. The person may remain placed in a housing unit for persons under the age of 18 until such time as the secretary of corrections determines that the person's needs and goals are no longer better met in that environment but in no case past the person's 25th birthday.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If the department of children, youth, and families establishes before a review board established under RCW 13.40.280 that continued placement of the person in a facility of the department of children, youth, and families presents a significant safety risk to other people in the facility, the department of children, youth, and families may transfer the person to the custody of the department of corrections;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any person who is at least 18 years old may request to be transferred to the custody of the department of corrections and must have access to counsel to review this decision. The voluntary transfer may not occur until at least one week following the person's meeting with counsel, and the person may request that a review board established under RCW 13.40.280 review the voluntary transfer decision to determine whether the person is making a knowing, voluntary, and willing transfer. The department of children, youth, and families shall coordinate with the department of corrections to transfer any person that makes a transfer request under this subsection. The department of corrections shall place individuals who voluntarily transfer to their custody under this subsection directly into any placement that is agreed to by the department of corrections without first placing the individual in a facility designed for classification.

<p>Until July 1, 2031, after taking the steps outlined in RCW 13.40.460(10) to release or transfer individuals to community facilities and after exhausting other available transfer options, if the population of the juvenile rehabilitation institution exceeds 110 percent of the safe operational capacity as described in RCW 13.40.460(9), the secretary of the department of children, youth, and families may identify a sufficient number of persons who are placed in a facility operated by the department of children, youth, and families under this section that must transfer to the custody of the department of corrections in order to reduce the population of the facility to a safe operational capacity, and the review board established under RCW 13.40.280 will determine whether the conditions outlined in this subsection apply. When considering whether a transfer under this subsection must occur, the review board established under RCW 13.40.280 must consider whether the transfer is necessary to reduce the population of the juvenile rehabilitation institution or whether the department of children, youth, and families may take less restrictive steps to reduce the population.</p>

<li>
<p>In determining which persons to transfer under this subsection (3), the department of children, youth, and families shall:</p>
