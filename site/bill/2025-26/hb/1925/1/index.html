<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that natural resource and conservation jobs are a critical component to Washington state's climate resilience and to rural economic vitality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that young people ages 14 to 17 have limited equitable pathways into natural resource and conservation fields. Most job opportunities for youth require them to choose between gaining high school graduation credit, skill building, or a paid position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that a connection to nature is strongly linked to positive mental and physical health outcomes. The youth in sustainable natural resource systems, or YESS programs, is an example of modern education for all children. This approach to education meets the learning needs of historically marginalized youth. Historic investments have been made in the health arena to address mental health problems, and this program increases protective factors for youth experiencing adverse childhood experiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that many students in Washington are not aware of the opportunities for family wage careers in the natural resource and conservation sectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that, as defined in the governor's office report &quot;education for a green economy,&quot; the state needs to advocate for critical-demand jobs in addition to high-demand jobs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to fund a career preparation program designed to continue and expand the operations of an existing program that engages youth in sustainable natural resource systems.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>

<li>
<p>Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall select a private sector, nonprofit partner to continue and expand the operations of an existing program designed to engage youth in sustainable natural resource systems, consistent with section 3 of this act.</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>Be able to administer and submit cost proposals for this program, including: Coordination of courses, an employer survey, a professional learning component for teachers, equipment, and student stipends;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demonstrate the ability to expand the program, with adequate funding and a focus on a career and technical framework that meet the requirements of RCW 28A.700.030, to address topics that contribute to the conservation of natural resources in Washington including, but not limited to: Aquaculture and fisheries, education through outdoor learning, renewable energy, restoration ecology, forest management, urban and community forestry, green stormwater infrastructure, forest fire management, and water resource management; and</p>

<p>An industry-recognized credential or document of competency aligned to local employer needs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>

<p>By December after the first and third year of state-funded programming, and in compliance with RCW 43.01.036, the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall submit a report to the legislature on the program described in this chapter.</p>
