<ol>
<li>
<p>The county auditor of a covered county described under subsection (2) of this section shall provide registration or voting notices, forms, instructions, assistance, or other materials or information relating to the electoral process, including ballots, in the language of covered language minority groups in that county as designated by the secretary of state under subsection (3) of this section, as well as in English.</p>
</li>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>At least two and one-half percent of citizens residing in a county who are of voting age or qualified to register to vote are members of a single language minority group and have limited English proficiency, and the illiteracy rate of the limited English proficient citizens who speak the same language exceed the national illiteracy rate; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county contains all or any part of an Indian reservation and at least two and one-half percent of the American Indian or Alaska Native citizens residing within the Indian reservation who are of voting age or qualified to register to vote are members of a single language minority group and have limited English proficiency, and the illiteracy rate of the limited English proficient citizens who speak the same language exceed the national illiteracy rate.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The secretary of state shall directly notify each covered county of the language designations and publish such designations in the Washington State Register within 30 days following the release of census data from the American community survey or decennial census.</p>

A county auditor may, no earlier than five years after a language minority group designation is made for that county by the secretary of state, petition the secretary to terminate the designation, and the secretary may grant the petition, if the county auditor proves using census data that the membership of the applicable language minority group falls below the thresholds described in subsection (2)(a) and (b) of this section and the illiteracy rate of that group is equal to or less than the national illiteracy rate.</p>

<li>
<p>The secretary of state shall establish a grant program to provide funding to counties to implement this section and section 2 of this act.</p>
