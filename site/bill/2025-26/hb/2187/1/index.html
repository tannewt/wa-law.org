<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the lack of affordable child care is a primary barrier to workforce participation, particularly for employees of small and mid-sized businesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that while large corporations often have the resources to provide on-site child care, small businesses are at a competitive disadvantage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of this act to establish a five-year pilot program to incentivize employer-supported child care. The legislature intends to cap the total fiscal impact of this tax credit program to ensure budget stability while explicitly authorizing and encouraging small businesses to pool their resources through child care consortiums.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preferences contained in sections 1 and 2, chapter . . ., Laws of 2026 (sections 1 and 2 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preferences. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or to be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature categorizes these tax preferences as ones intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(a), and to provide tax relief for certain businesses or individuals, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(e).</p>

<p>If a review finds that the total number of child care slots supported by employers claiming the credit in this act has increased year-over-year during the first two years of the credit's existence, then the legislature intends to extend the expiration date of the tax preferences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may refer to any data collected by the state.</p>
