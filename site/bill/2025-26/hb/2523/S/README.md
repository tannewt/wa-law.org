# HB 2523 - Community reinvestment prg.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2523-S.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that in order to address racial, economic, and social disparities in communities across the state created by the historical design and enforcement of state and federal criminal laws and penalties for drug possession and use in Washington state, aggressive approaches and targeted resources to support local design and control of community-based responses to these outcomes are required.

The legislature further finds that it initially appropriated $1,000,000 for the development of a community reinvestment plan and $200,000,000 for implementation of the plan in the 2023-2025 fiscal biennium through the community reinvestment account in RCW 43.79.567. The legislature subsequently appropriated an additional $60,000,000 and $50,000,000 for the 2025-2027 and 2027-2029 fiscal biennia. The legislature finds that the initial phase of the program required use of the department of commerce's existing programs and networks to distribute money as quickly as possible. The department of commerce and the office of equity published a preliminary report on December 1, 2022, a community reinvestment plan report on September 19, 2023, and a community investment plan implementation report in October 2025. The legislature intends to transfer an amount no less than $100,000,000 per year for continued implementation of the community investment plan, reporting on the plan, and updates to the plan.

The legislature recognizes that despite the development of a community investment plan and reporting on implementation of the plan, existing programs and networks may not reach the people who are most affected by the historic laws and penalties for drug possession. Therefore, the legislature intends for the next phase of implementation to include policy direction for expenditure of the legislative appropriations, reporting on distribution of the appropriated funds, direction to update the community investment plan at least every five years, and review of implementation of the program to date by the Washington state institute for public policy.

## Section 2
1. The community reinvestment account is created in the state treasury. Revenues to the account shall consist of appropriations and transfers by the legislature and all other moneys directed for deposit into the account. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation.

2. Expenditures from the account may be used by the department of commerce for:

    a. Economic development, which includes addressing wealth disparities to promote asset building such as homeownership and expanding access to financial resources including, but not limited to, grants and loans for small businesses and entrepreneurs, financial literacy training, and other small business training and support activities;

    b. Civil and criminal legal assistance to provide postconviction relief and case assistance, including the expungement of criminal records and vacation of criminal convictions;

    c. Community-based violence intervention and prevention services, which may include after-school programs focused on providing education and mentorship to youths;

    d. Reentry services to facilitate successful transitions for persons formerly incarcerated in an adult correctional facility or juvenile residential facility in Washington; and

    e. Agricultural and economic support and services available to historically marginalized communities.

    a. Funds appropriated to the community reinvestment account must be allocated in equal proportions across the following funding strategies:

        i. Economic development under subsection (2)(a) of this section;

    b. The department of commerce may adjust allocations within a fiscal biennium only upon a determination, documented in the report required under section 3 of this act, that an equal allocation would result in unexpended funds or materially limit access for eligible communities.

4. The distribution of the grants under this section must be done in collaboration with "by and for community organizations" and consistent with the governor's executive order regarding consultation with federally recognized Indian tribes. "By and for community organizations" include, but are not limited to, those operated by and for Black, Latino, Native American, Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities. Grants must be allocated consistent with the criteria identified in section 3 of this act.

## Section 3
1. The department shall, in partnership with the office of equity, and "by and for community organizations", update the community reinvestment plan as needed, but no less frequently than every five years to identify the distribution of funds allocated to the community reinvestment account in RCW 43.79.567. The plan must be developed using a community-based participatory action research approach and include funding recommendations, programmatic guidelines, funding distribution, long-term economic benefits, monitoring, and evaluation.

2. At a minimum, the plan must address how the community reinvestment account funding will:

    a. Expand program reach and stabilization outcomes;

    b. Address racial, economic, and social disparities in communities across the state;

    c. Produce significant long-term economic benefits to the state, a region of the state, or a particular community in the state;

    e. Ensure that:

        i. Projects or programs do not require continuing state support;

        ii. An expenditure will not supplant private investment;

        iii. An expenditure is accompanied by additional public or private investment;

        iv. Nonprofit, faith-based, and grassroots organizations that are "by and for community organizations" and are led by, governed by, and primarily serve communities experiencing persistent racial, economic, or social disparities are prioritized for competitive funding opportunities;

    v. Programmatic guidelines encourage collaborative partnerships and system integration to maximize effectiveness and reduce duplication; and

    vi. A framework for the equitable geographic and demographic distribution of funds is included; and

    f. Identify the criteria for the allocation of grants.

        i. At a minimum, the criteria must prioritize:

(A) Historically underserved or minority populations;

(B) "By and for community organizations"; and

(C) Populations in rural, regional, or geographically underserved areas of the state that experience barriers to access, historical representation, and resources.

        ii. The department shall not award funds for economic development under RCW 43.79.567(2)(a) to an organization for a period longer than five years, unless the department documents in the report required under subsection (4) of this section that an allocation beyond five years is required to meet the objectives of this section for an organization.

3.

    d. An analysis of economic impacts on target communities, including impacts on employment, income, wealth-building opportunities, housing stability, and community capacity, to the extent practicable;

    e. Disaggregated data, where feasible, by race, ethnicity, geography, and population served, consistent with state data privacy standards; and

    f. Recommendations for statutory, administrative, or budgetary changes to improve equity, effectiveness, and accessibility of the program.

6. The department shall collaborate with the office of equity to provide the services in this subsection within the appropriations provided to the department for the program.
