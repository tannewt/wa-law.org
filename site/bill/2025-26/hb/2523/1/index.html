<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that in order to address racial, economic, and social disparities in communities across the state created by the historical design and enforcement of state and federal criminal laws and penalties for drug possession and use in Washington state, aggressive approaches and targeted resources to support local design and control of community-based responses to these outcomes are required.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that it initially appropriated $1,000,000 for the development of a community reinvestment plan and $200,000,000 for implementation of the plan in the 2023-2025 fiscal biennium through the community reinvestment account in RCW 43.79.567. The legislature subsequently appropriated an additional $60,000,000 and $50,000,000 for the 2025-2027 and 2027-2029 fiscal biennia. The legislature finds that the initial phase of the program required use of the department of commerce's existing programs and networks to distribute money as quickly as possible. The department of commerce and the office of equity published a preliminary report on December 1, 2022, a community reinvestment plan report on September 19, 2023, and a community investment plan implementation report in October 2025. The legislature intends to transfer an amount no less than $100,000,000 per year for continued implementation of the community investment plan, annual reporting on the plan, and updates to the plan.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that despite the development of a community investment plan and reporting on implementation of the plan, existing programs and networks may not reach the people who are most affected by the historic laws and penalties for drug possession. Therefore, the legislature intends for the next phase of implementation to include policy direction for expenditure of the legislative appropriations, annual reporting on distribution of the appropriated funds, direction to update the community investment plan every 10 years, and review of implementation of the program to date by the Washington state institute for public policy.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>

<li>
<p>Ensure that:</p>
<ol type="i">

</li>
<li>
