<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that 6PPD (N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine) is a chemical commonly used in motor vehicle tires to keep them from cracking and degrading quickly. 6PPD works by moving to the surface of the tire and forming a film that protects the tire. When 6PPD is exposed to oxygen and ozone at the surface of a tire, it forms 6PPD-quinone (2-((4-methylpentan-2-yl)amino)-5-(phenylamino)cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione). As tires are used and degrade, they release 6PPD-quinone as tire wear particles that are washed or deposited into streams, rivers, and other water bodies through stormwater runoff, aerial deposition, and other pathways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that 6PPD-quinone is directly linked to urban runoff mortality syndrome, a condition where coho salmon die prior to spawning. 6PPD-quinone is known to be toxic to aquatic species and is the primary causal toxicant for coho salmon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes the urgency in reducing and stopping the release of 6PPD-quinone into Washington waterways by incentivizing the development and use of safer alternatives to protect salmon, trout, and other aquatic species. Salmon, trout, and other aquatic species are central to Washington's ecosystems, treaty-reserved tribal rights, cultural heritage, recreational fishing, and the state's economy. Ongoing mortality of salmonids linked to 6PPD-quinone undermines ecological health, fisheries, and community well-being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that alternatives to 6PPD are under development. Phasing out 6PPD in favor of safer alternatives will incentivize innovation, protect aquatic species, reduce stormwater pollution, align with Washington's leadership in toxics reduction and salmonid recovery, and provide the timing necessary to identify an alternative to 6PPD that ensures motorist safety and protection of human health and the environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is therefore the legislature's intent to restrict 6PPD in tires after providing time for the industry to bring 6PPD alternatives into the marketplace, and restrict 6PPD substitutes that are not safer alternatives to 6PPD in tires.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</p>

<p>&quot;6PPD&quot; has the same meaning as in RCW 70A.350.010(1).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Department&quot; means the department of ecology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Regrettable 6PPD substitute&quot; means a chemical or chemicals that are not determined by the department to be a safer alternative consistent with section 3 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Safer alternative&quot; has the same meaning as in RCW 70A.350.010.</p>
</li>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Beginning January 1, 2035, no person may manufacture, sell, offer for sale, distribute for sale, or distribute for use in this state a new vehicle tire containing intentionally added 6PPD or a regrettable 6PPD substitute identified by rule by the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In adopting rules to identify regrettable 6PPD substitutes subject to the requirements of this section, the department, in consultation with the department of health, may consider information generated by other states or nations to identify likely regrettable 6PPD substitutes. The department may identify as a regrettable 6PPD substitute any alternative that it determines is not a safer alternative consistent with the criteria established under chapter 70A.350 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provisions of this section do not apply to vehicle tires for use on products certified, regulated, or specified by the United States federal aviation administration, United States department of defense, United States department of homeland security, or the national aeronautics and space administration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this chapter limits the authority of the department with respect to tires, 6PPD, or 6PPD substitutes under chapter 70A.350 RCW.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
