# HB 1184 - Creating a narrow exemption from overtime provisions for certain nonprofits and small businesses.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1184.pdf)

## Section 1
1. Washington's nonprofit organizations improve the lives of thousands of Washingtonians and are a part of the state's economy.  Nonprofit organizations serve communities in a variety of ways, such as supporting veterans, stewarding the environment, supporting performing arts and education, fostering and supporting families, promoting economic development, and much more.

2. Small businesses also are a significant part of the state's economy and are an important part of communities across the state.

3. The legislature recognizes that due to the nature and structure of smaller nonprofits and small businesses, these entities and their ability to continue to meet their communities' needs are being jeopardized by the state overtime rules for exempt employees. When fully implemented in 2028, the minimum salary to be classified as a salaried exempt employee will be two and a half times the statewide minimum wage for a 40-hour week, which is estimated to be approximately $93,000 a year and the highest salary threshold in the nation. Therefore, the legislature is creating a narrow exemption from overtime provisions to allow more flexibility to these entities and their salaried employees.

## Section 2
1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no employer shall employ any of his or her employees for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such employee receives compensation for his or her employment in excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he or she is employed.

2. This section does not apply to:

    a. Any person exempted pursuant to RCW 49.46.010(3). The payment of compensation or provision of compensatory time off in addition to a salary shall not be a factor in determining whether a person is exempted under RCW 49.46.010(3)(c);

    b. Employees who request compensating time off in lieu of overtime pay;

    c. Any individual employed as a seaman whether or not the seaman is employed on a vessel other than an American vessel;

    h. Any industry in which federal law provides for an overtime payment based on a workweek other than forty hours. However, the provisions of the federal law regarding overtime payment based on a workweek other than forty hours shall nevertheless apply to employees covered by this section without regard to the existence of actual federal jurisdiction over the industrial activity of the particular employer within this state. For the purposes of this subsection, "industry" means a trade, business, industry, or other activity, or branch, or group thereof, in which individuals are gainfully employed (section 3(h) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended (Public Law 93-259));
