<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that Article II, section 30 of the state Constitution requires legislators who have a private interest in any bill or measure proposed or pending before the legislature to disclose that fact and not vote on that measure. This constitutional requirement imposes a clear and strict standard for disclosure and recusal for legislators. The legislature finds that this high ethical standard also imposes a duty on legislators to ensure trust, openness, and honesty in their actions. However, the legislative record does not reflect any discussion of this paramount duty when the legislature amended statutory ethics provisions in 2025 to hold state officers and municipal officers to different ethical standards concerning conflicts of interests.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that prior to 2025, state officers and employees were held to a similar standard as municipal officers in terms of the prohibition on having beneficial interests in contracts and certain other transactions made by, through, or under their supervision. In 2025, while the standard for municipal officers remained the same, prohibiting more than a remote interest, meaning one percent or more, in contracts, state ethics laws were amended to adopt, among other things, a different standard for what constitutes a conflict of interest for state officers and employees which is 10 times laxer than the standard that has been applied to municipal officers for decades.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that by adopting a standard for itself which is weaker than what it has required municipal officers to meet, it did not adequately consider its constitutional duty to ensure trust, openness, and honesty in the actions of legislators. By allowing legislators to own up to 10 percent of an entity that has a financial interest in a contract, sale, lease, purchase, or grant with the state, while barring municipal officers from holding anything more than one percent of an entity that similarly contracts or does business with the local government, the legislature has unjustifiably created differing standards that do not live up to the Constitution's strict standard for disclosure and recusal for legislators. The legislature intends for state officers and employees to abide by the same conflict of interest requirements that apply to municipal officers.</p>
