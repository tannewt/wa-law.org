<li>
<p>This section provides an alternative process for awarding contracts for construction, renovation, remodeling, alteration, repair, or improvement of department structures, highways, and facilities.

</li>
<li>
<p>The department may create a single roster or may create multiple rosters for different categories of anticipated work. Qualified contractors shall be added to the roster or rosters at any time they submit a written request, necessary records, and meet the qualifications established by the department. Only contractors that have been prequalified by the department consistent with RCW 47.28.070 may be added to a roster.</p>
