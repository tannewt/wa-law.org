# HB 1099 - Tenant assistance program

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1099.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that a significant number of Washington residents are currently rent-burdened, spending a disproportionate amount of their income on housing expenses. High rents have become a substantial burden for too many Washingtonians, limiting their ability to access safe and affordable housing. This situation creates economic instability and negatively impacts the overall well-being of individuals and families across the state. This strain contributes to financial insecurity, making it challenging for individuals and families of all shapes and sizes to meet other essential needs, such as health care, education, and savings for the future. This phenomenon exacerbates existing inequalities and hinders economic mobility for a significant portion of the population.

2. The legislature has taken significant steps to address the affordable housing crisis, including investing in housing development, expanding rental assistance programs, and enacting tenant protections. However, these efforts will take time to bear fruit, and many households continue to face immediate financial hardship due to high rental costs.

3. Therefore, the legislature intends to address the issue of housing affordability by establishing a tenant assistance program. This program aims to reduce the number of people who are rent-burdened by providing financial assistance to eligible individuals and families. This program seeks to create a more equitable and accessible housing market, fostering stability and opportunity for Washington residents. By implementing this program, the legislature aims to alleviate the economic strain caused by high rents, promote housing security, and enhance the overall quality of life for residents of the state.

## Section 2
1. The tenant assistance program is created as a grant program administered by the department of commerce. The department may adopt any rules necessary to administer the program.

2. As part of the tenant assistance program, the department of commerce shall provide grants to public housing authorities created under chapter 35.82 RCW for the purpose of providing tenant assistance payments for eligible renters as described in this section.

3. To be eligible for tenant assistance payments, a renter must meet all of the following criteria:

    a. The renter must have a household income at or below 80 percent of the median household income adjusted for household size, for the county where the household is located, as reported by the United States department of housing and urban development;

    b. The renter must spend more than 30 percent of the renter's monthly household income on monthly housing costs, including rent, fees, and utilities; and

    c. The renter would not have to spend more than 30 percent of their monthly household income on monthly housing costs, including rent, fees, and utilities, if the renter's monthly rent payment was reduced by $400 or less.

4. A public housing authority must prioritize providing tenant assistance payments for eligible renters who meet any of the following criteria:

    a. The eligible renter has a household income at or below 60 percent of the median household income adjusted for household size, for the county where the household is located, as reported by the United States department of housing and urban development; or

    b. The eligible renter receives supplemental security income.

6. Only one eligible renter per household may receive tenant assistance payments.

7. An eligible renter may receive tenant assistance payments for up to 12 consecutive months.

    b. A renter who provides false documentation under this subsection must repay any tenant assistance payments received and is no longer eligible for participation in the tenant assistance program.

9. A landlord may not discriminate against renters receiving tenant assistance payments under this section.

10. By July 30, 2026, and annually thereafter, and in compliance with RCW 43.01.036, the department of commerce shall submit a report to the appropriate committees of the legislature on the tenant assistance program that includes information on the total number of renter households served by the program, the total dollar amount of rental assistance distributed to renters as tenant assistance payments, the average number of months that a renter household receives tenant assistance payments, and any recommendations for changes to the program. The department of commerce must also post a copy of the report to the department's website.

11. For the purposes of this section, "renter" means any person who rents a dwelling unit under a rental agreement subject to chapter 59.18 RCW or a manufactured/mobile home lot under a rental agreement subject to chapter 59.20 RCW.
