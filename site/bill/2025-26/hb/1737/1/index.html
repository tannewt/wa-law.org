<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes the sovereignty of federally recognized tribal governments and the essential role their apprenticeship programs play in the development of a skilled and trained workforce, particularly in rural and underrepresented communities. Tribal apprenticeship programs ensure tribal members have equitable access to employment and training opportunities in critical industries, including in the building and construction trades at petroleum refineries and in petrochemical manufacturing. The legislature intends for apprenticeship programs operated by federally recognized tribal governments to have the same rights and responsibilities as other approved programs that supply workers to these critical industries, so long as those programs have completed the federal approval process for apprenticeship programs.</p>
