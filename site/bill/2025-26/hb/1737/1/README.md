# HB 1737 - Apprenticeships/tribal gov.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1737.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature recognizes the sovereignty of federally recognized tribal governments and the essential role their apprenticeship programs play in the development of a skilled and trained workforce, particularly in rural and underrepresented communities. Tribal apprenticeship programs ensure tribal members have equitable access to employment and training opportunities in critical industries, including in the building and construction trades at petroleum refineries and in petrochemical manufacturing. The legislature intends for apprenticeship programs operated by federally recognized tribal governments to have the same rights and responsibilities as other approved programs that supply workers to these critical industries, so long as those programs have completed the federal approval process for apprenticeship programs.

## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

2. "Department" means the department of labor and industries.

3. "On-site work" does not include ship and rail car support activities; environmental inspection and testing; security guard services; work which is performed by an original equipment manufacturer for warranty, repair, or maintenance on the vendor's equipment if required by the original equipment manufacturer's warranty agreement between the original equipment manufacturer and the owner; industrial cleaning not related to construction; safety services requiring professional safety certification; nonconstruction catalyst loading, regeneration, and removal; chemical purging and cleaning; refinery by-product separation and recovery; inspection services not related to construction; and work performed that is not in an apprenticeable occupation.

    b. The worker is being paid at least a rate commensurate with the wages typically paid for the occupation in the applicable geographic area, subject to the following provisions:

        i. The prevailing wage rate paid for a worker in the applicable occupation and geographic area on public works projects may be used to determine the appropriate rate of pay, however, this subsection (7)(b) does not require a contractor to pay prevailing wage rates; and
