# HB 2045 - Business and occupation tax

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2045.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that funding education, public safety, health care, and basic human needs helps Washington succeed and thrive. The state's paramount duty is to provide every child with an education, thereby creating the opportunity for each child to succeed in school and achieve success in life. To promote and improve public safety, the state funds the basic law enforcement academy to train and certify every peace officer in the state. The state invests in health care programs that deliver critical, life-saving services, and protect the well-being of the public. The state also supports vital basic needs assistance to the state's lowest-income households, educates the youngest learners, and strengthens food security for seniors.

Therefore, the legislature intends to levy an incremental surcharge on the gross revenue of the state's highest earning businesses and amend the surcharge on the gross revenue of large financial institutions to meet the state's obligation to provide adequate funding for K-12 education, public safety, health care, and other human service investments. The legislature finds the levying of this tax is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, or support of the state government and its existing public institutions.

    b. "Consolidated financial institution group" means all financial institutions that are affiliated with each other.

    c. "Consolidated financial statement" means a consolidated financial institution group's consolidated reports of condition and income filed with the federal financial institutions examination council, or successor agency.

    d. "Financial institution" means:

        i. Any corporation or other business entity chartered under Titles 30A, 30B, 31, 32, and 33 RCW, or registered under the federal bank holding company act of 1956, as amended, or registered as a savings and loan holding company under the federal national housing act, as amended;

        ix.(A) A corporation or other business entity that receives more than 50 percent of its total gross income for federal income tax purposes from finance leases. For purposes of this subsection, a "finance lease" means a lease that meets two requirements:

(I) It is the type of lease permitted to be made by national banks (see 12 U.S.C. Sec. 24(7) and (10), comptroller of the currency regulations, part 23, leasing (added by 56 C.F.R. Sec. 28314, June 20, 1991, effective July 22, 1991), and regulation Y of the federal reserve system 12 C.F.R. Part 225.25, as amended); and

(II) It is the economic equivalent of an extension of credit, i.e., the lease is treated by the lessor as a loan for federal income tax purposes. In no event does a lease qualify as an extension of credit where the lessor takes depreciation on such property for federal income tax purposes.

(B) For this classification to apply, the average of the gross income in the current tax year and immediately preceding two tax years must satisfy the more than 50 percent requirement;

    x.

        ii. If financial institutions are no longer required to file consolidated financial statements, "specified financial institution" means any person that was subject to the additional tax in this section in at least two of the previous four calendar years.

3. The department must notify the fiscal committees of the legislature if financial institutions are no longer required to file consolidated financial statements.

4. To aid in the effective administration of the additional tax imposed in this section, the department may require a person believed to be a specified financial institution to disclose whether it is a member of a consolidated financial institution group and, if so, to identify all other members of its consolidated financial institution group. A person failing to comply with this subsection is deemed to have intended to evade tax payable under this section and is subject to the penalty in RCW 82.32.090(7) on any tax due under this section by the person and any financial institution affiliated with the person.

5. Taxes collected under this section must be deposited into the general fund.
