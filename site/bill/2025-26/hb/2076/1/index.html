<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that most of the state's government enforcement decisions and discretionary expenditures are not made by elected representatives but rather by unelected bureaucrats within government agencies who view themselves as immune from accountability. Likewise, most legal edicts are not laws enacted by the legislature but are rules and regulations promulgated by bureaucrats. This imposes massive direct and indirect costs on Washington's working taxpayers. The legislature finds that United States supreme court decisions in West Virginia v. EPA and Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo serve as relevant reminders that agencies only have the authority granted to them as specified by statute. In West Virginia v. EPA, the court declared that an agency that seeks to decide an issue of vast economic and political significance must have clear congressional authorization to do so; a principle referred to as the major questions doctrine. In the case of Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, the court held that the federal administrative procedure act requires courts to exercise their independent judgment in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory authority rather than deferring to an agency's interpretation of the law simply because a statute is ambiguous. Consistent with these principles, the legislature recognizes the need for a comprehensive review of state statutes and agency regulations for the purpose of improving the efficiency of state government operations and expenditures and ensuring that statutes that delegate authority to agencies provide clear and specific legislative authorization.</p>
<p>The legislature intends to establish the Washington department of government efficiency, hereinafter referred to as &quot;WADOGE,&quot; to develop and launch a process to identify state government policies, processes, and expenditures that are inefficient or unnecessary and should be considered for removal. The legislature intends for WADOGE to work with agencies to identify and halt enforcement of regulations that are beyond an agency's statutory authority and that should therefore be repealed. The legislature also intends for WADOGE to work with agencies to find opportunities to consolidate duplicative and miscellaneous agency functions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the legislature intends for all agencies, departments, offices, boards, commissions, and other state entities to assist in identifying policies, processes, and expenditures that should be considered for removal and to help improve the state's budget decisions.</p>
<p>To achieve these goals, the legislature intends WADOGE to pursue the following four major methods of reform to improve state government efficiency and budget decisions: Regulatory rescission; administrative streamlining; encouraging cost savings for Washington consumers; and preventing the political weaponization of agencies.</p>
<p>The legislature intends for WADOGE to report its findings and suggestions on a regular basis to the legislature through reports to the joint legislative audit and review committee, the office of the governor, and other state executive branch offices as is relevant.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that WADOGE's establishment and efforts are necessary to implement the budget.</p>

<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the expanding web of state regulations impose significant hardship on the lives of millions of Washingtonians and limits economic growth. The legislature finds that these regulations are often difficult for the average person or business to understand, as they require the synthesizing of formal laws and agency rules, memoranda, administrative orders, published guidance, policy statements, and interagency agreements. This further increases compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance. Therefore, it is the state's policy that for each new rule adopted, at least two existing rules must be identified and repealed. The legislature's intent to ensure that the cost of planned regulations is responsibly managed and controlled through a rigorous regulatory budgeting process.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that the people of Washington have witnessed their state government weaponize the legal force of numerous agencies against those perceived to be political opponents in the form of investigations, prosecutions, civil enforcement actions, and other related actions. The legislature finds that many of these activities appear to be inconsistent with the state Constitution or other laws of this state, including those activities directed at parents protesting at school board meetings and other Washingtonians who were simply exercising constitutionally protected rights. The legislature finds that under the guise of combatting &quot;misinformation,&quot; &quot;disinformation,&quot; and &quot;malinformation,&quot; some agencies have infringed on the constitutionally protected speech rights of the people of Washington in a manner that advanced preferred political narratives about significant matters of public debate, including election integrity, the delivery of health care services, and reforms to Washington's struggling K-12 public school system. Therefore, the legislature intends to set forth a process to ensure that there is accountability for the weaponization of the state government against the people of Washington.</p>
