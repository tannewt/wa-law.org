## Section 1
1. Each regional transportation planning organization shall develop in cooperation with the department of transportation, providers of public transportation and high capacity transportation, ports, and local governments within the region, adopt, and periodically update a regional transportation plan that:

    a. Is based on a least cost planning methodology that identifies the most cost-effective facilities, services, and programs;

    b. Identifies existing or planned transportation facilities, services, and programs, including but not limited to major roadways including state highways and regional arterials, transit and nonmotorized services and facilities, multimodal and intermodal facilities, marine ports and airports, railroads, and noncapital programs including transportation demand management that should function as an integrated regional transportation system, giving emphasis to those facilities, services, and programs that exhibit one or more of the following characteristics:

        i. Crosses member county lines;

        ii. Is or will be used by a significant number of people who live or work outside the county in which the facility, service, or project is located;

        iii. Significant impacts are expected to be felt in more than one county;

        iv. Potentially adverse impacts of the facility, service, program, or project can be better avoided or mitigated through adherence to regional policies;

    v. Transportation needs addressed by a project have been identified by the regional transportation planning process and the remedy is deemed to have regional significance; and

    vi. Provides for system continuity;

    c. Establishes level of service standards for state highways and state ferry routes, with the exception of transportation facilities of statewide significance as defined in RCW 47.06.140. These regionally established level of service standards for state highways and state ferries shall be developed jointly with the department of transportation, to encourage consistency across jurisdictions. In establishing level of service standards for state highways and state ferries, consideration shall be given for the necessary balance between providing for the free interjurisdictional movement of people and goods and the needs of local commuters using state facilities;

    d. Includes a financial plan demonstrating how the regional transportation plan can be implemented, indicating resources from public and private sources that are reasonably expected to be made available to carry out the plan, and recommending any innovative financing techniques to finance needed facilities, services, and programs;

    e. Assesses regional development patterns, capital investment and other measures necessary to:

        i. Ensure the preservation of the existing regional transportation system, including requirements for operational improvements, resurfacing, restoration, and rehabilitation of existing and future major roadways, as well as operations, maintenance, modernization, and rehabilitation of existing and future transit, railroad systems and corridors, and nonmotorized facilities; and

        ii. Make the most efficient use of existing transportation facilities to relieve vehicular congestion and maximize the mobility of people and goods;

    f. Sets forth a proposed regional transportation approach, including capital investments, service improvements, programs, and transportation demand management measures to guide the development of the integrated, multimodal regional transportation system. For regional growth centers, the approach must address transportation concurrency strategies required under RCW 36.70A.070 and include a measurement of vehicle level of service for off-peak periods and total multimodal capacity for peak periods;

    g. Where appropriate, sets forth the relationship of high capacity transportation providers and other public transit providers with regard to responsibility for, and the coordination between, services and facilities; and

    h. Provides for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and vehicle miles traveled. This subsection applies only to regional transportation planning organizations that contain a county or counties meeting the criteria in RCW 36.70A.095. In the event that a county is included in two regional transportation planning organizations, the requirements of this subsection apply to the regional transportation planning organization with the larger population.

2. The organization shall review the regional transportation plan biennially for currency and forward the adopted plan along with documentation of the biennial review to the state department of transportation.

3. All transportation projects, programs, and transportation demand management measures within the region that have an impact upon regional facilities or services must be consistent with the plan and with the adopted regional growth and transportation strategies.
