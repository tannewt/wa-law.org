<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to establish a prioritization process to inform capital budget funding for state campus district energy system decarbonization projects. The legislature intends to support these campus energy decarbonization projects through capital appropriations that are additive, and do not supplant, capital budget funding for routine capital construction and renovation projects included in agencies' 10-year capital plans. Further, the legislature intends to provide state agencies with a high degree of funding predictability for projects that decarbonize state campus district energy systems, as those systems are defined in chapter 19.27A RCW, and to create an efficient process that supports compliance with the state's adopted clean buildings performance standards and statutory greenhouse gas emission limits for state agencies.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The campus energy upgrades committee is established within the department. The committee shall administer a prioritization process for scoring and ranking capital decarbonization projects for state campus district energy systems as those systems are defined in RCW 19.27A.260.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The campus energy upgrades committee shall develop and adopt a project scoring and ranking process by which capital projects for state campus district energy systems are prioritized for funding recommendations. The committee must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Provide guidelines and templates for agencies to use when submitting projects to the committee for consideration; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider weighting the criteria in subsection (3) of this section. The committee may adopt additional criteria as it deems necessary.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The adopted scoring and ranking process and associated guidelines must expand upon, and must not conflict with, existing statutory requirements for energy standards, as applicable. These standards may include, but are not limited to, energy life-cycle cost analysis and standards for major facility projects under Title 39 RCW, and energy-related building standards under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The committee must include the following elements, in no particular order, in its adopted scoring and ranking process:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The approximate dollar value by fiscal year of operating cost savings upon completion of the proposed project, by fiscal year, over the entirety of the project's useful life. If the proposed project is a discrete phase of a larger project, the estimated savings resulting from both the discrete phase and from the planned completion of the entire campus district energy project must be considered, as deemed appropriate by the committee;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The approximate dollar value of avoided capital maintenance or replacement costs for repairs to existing energy systems for the expected or practical useful life of the existing systems being replaced or upgraded by the proposed project;</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>The amount of greenhouse gas emission reductions for the agency that are estimated to be achieved by the project, including the extent to which the project contributes to achieving agency compliance with greenhouse gas emission limits for state agencies outlined in RCW 70A.45.050 and energy-related building standards in this chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The energy use intensity reductions in buildings connected to the district energy system project;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amount of leveraged nonstate funding or in-kind contributions from other partners. This may include the use of a public-private partnership in which the private partner funds a portion or all of the design or construction of infrastructure associated with the project;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The expected reduction in greenhouse gas emission by private entities in the project area as a result of: (i) The state campus district energy system acting as an anchor customer for a thermal energy network deployed pursuant to RCW 80.28.450; (ii) the resulting expansion of such a thermal energy network; or (iii) the extent to which the project otherwise may reduce energy costs for surrounding residences and businesses;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The extent to which the proposed project is discrete, or phased, and the portion of the project that would be completed with the requested funding;</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>The addition of cooling capability to facilities that do not have existing cooling infrastructure;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the extent practicable, the overall balance of statewide geographic distribution of projects recommended for funding while considering the availability of current and developing workforce in the project area;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The alignment of the project with locally adopted climate action plans for the city or county in which the project is located;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The extent to which the project contributes to state or local emergency preparedness and disaster resilience;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The alignment of the proposed project with other major capital projects planned for the campus in order to achieve efficiencies and related cost savings when possible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The committee may prioritize projects that address systems that are at the end of their expected useful life or are at risk of imminent failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The committee must review related project information produced by the energy life-cycle cost analysis conducted under chapter 39.35 RCW if available. In addition, the committee must share project proposal information with the department of enterprise services for use in the energy life-cycle cost analysis, if the analysis is required, in order to avoid duplication of effort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The committee and the department may request additional information from agencies that submitted plans under RCW 19.27A.260 in order to validate data used in the prioritization framework developed under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When developing and finalizing each recommended funding list, the committee must consider: (a) The need to balance long-term system planning and growth priorities for state entities; (b) the need to balance major capital project requests for design and construction funding, given the fiscal impact of funded design projects on the state's overall capital budget; and (c) the need to balance state capital funding between design and construction project phases to meet state priorities and associated deadlines established in this chapter and RCW 70A.45.050.</p>
