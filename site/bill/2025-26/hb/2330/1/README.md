# HB 2330 - Establishing a prioritization process for capital funding for state campus district energy systems.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2330.pdf)

## Section 1
It is the intent of the legislature to establish a prioritization process to inform capital budget funding for state campus district energy system decarbonization projects. The legislature intends to support these campus energy decarbonization projects through capital appropriations that are additive, and do not supplant, capital budget funding for routine capital construction and renovation projects included in agencies' 10-year capital plans. Further, the legislature intends to provide state agencies with a high degree of funding predictability for projects that decarbonize state campus district energy systems, as those systems are defined in chapter 19.27A RCW, and to create an efficient process that supports compliance with the state's adopted clean buildings performance standards and statutory greenhouse gas emission limits for state agencies.

## Section 2
1. The campus energy upgrades committee is established within the department. The committee shall administer a prioritization process for scoring and ranking capital decarbonization projects for state campus district energy systems as those systems are defined in RCW 19.27A.260.

2. The committee shall be comprised of 11 voting and two nonvoting members. The director of the department shall appoint committee members for staggered two-year and three-year terms, as determined by the director. The director shall endeavor to appoint members representing diverse geographic regions of the state. Voting members must include:

    a. One representative of the state energy office established in chapter 43.21F RCW;

    b. Three persons with technical expertise in building decarbonization, thermal energy network or district heating and cooling system construction or conversion that is intended to reduce fossil fuel consumption, or related subject matter. At least one of these members must have experience in environmental justice issues;

    c. One person with professional expertise in life-cycle greenhouse gas accounting;

    d. One person with experience in developing and advocating for public-private partnerships in the clean energy or clean buildings sector;

    e. One person with professional experience in financing or engineering complex decarbonization projects;

    f. One person representing the interests of organized labor;

    g. One person representing electric utilities;

    h. One representative of the Washington utilities and transportation commission; and

        i. The state treasurer or the state treasurer's designee.

3. One representative of the office of financial management and one representative of the department of enterprise services shall serve as nonvoting members acting in an advisory role to the committee.

4. The committee may consult with outside advisors and subject matter experts as needed.

5. Committee members shall serve without compensation but may request reimbursement for travel expenses as provided in RCW 43.03.050 and 43.03.060.

6. By a majority vote of appointed members, the committee shall select a committee chair for a term of two or three years.

7. The committee may adopt policies and procedures necessary to carry out its duties under this act.

8. The department shall provide staff support to the committee.

9. Meetings of the committee must comply with chapter 42.30 RCW, the open public meetings act, and must provide regular opportunities for public comment.

## Section 3
1. The campus energy upgrades committee shall develop and adopt a project scoring and ranking process by which capital projects for state campus district energy systems are prioritized for funding recommendations. The committee must:

    a. Provide guidelines and templates for agencies to use when submitting projects to the committee for consideration; and

    b. Consider weighting the criteria in subsection (3) of this section. The committee may adopt additional criteria as it deems necessary.

2. The adopted scoring and ranking process and associated guidelines must expand upon, and must not conflict with, existing statutory requirements for energy standards, as applicable. These standards may include, but are not limited to, energy life-cycle cost analysis and standards for major facility projects under Title 39 RCW, and energy-related building standards under this chapter.

3. The committee must include the following elements, in no particular order, in its adopted scoring and ranking process:

    a. The approximate dollar value by fiscal year of operating cost savings upon completion of the proposed project, by fiscal year, over the entirety of the project's useful life. If the proposed project is a discrete phase of a larger project, the estimated savings resulting from both the discrete phase and from the planned completion of the entire campus district energy project must be considered, as deemed appropriate by the committee;

    b. The approximate dollar value of avoided capital maintenance or replacement costs for repairs to existing energy systems for the expected or practical useful life of the existing systems being replaced or upgraded by the proposed project;

    c. The readiness of the project to proceed to construction;

    d. The amount of greenhouse gas emission reductions for the agency that are estimated to be achieved by the project, including the extent to which the project contributes to achieving agency compliance with greenhouse gas emission limits for state agencies outlined in RCW 70A.45.050 and energy-related building standards in this chapter;

    e. The energy use intensity reductions in buildings connected to the district energy system project;

    f. The amount of leveraged nonstate funding or in-kind contributions from other partners. This may include the use of a public-private partnership in which the private partner funds a portion or all of the design or construction of infrastructure associated with the project;

    g. The expected reduction in greenhouse gas emission by private entities in the project area as a result of: (i) The state campus district energy system acting as an anchor customer for a thermal energy network deployed pursuant to RCW 80.28.450; (ii) the resulting expansion of such a thermal energy network; or (iii) the extent to which the project otherwise may reduce energy costs for surrounding residences and businesses;

    h. The extent to which the proposed project is discrete, or phased, and the portion of the project that would be completed with the requested funding;

        i. The addition of cooling capability to facilities that do not have existing cooling infrastructure;

    j. To the extent practicable, the overall balance of statewide geographic distribution of projects recommended for funding while considering the availability of current and developing workforce in the project area;

    k. The alignment of the project with locally adopted climate action plans for the city or county in which the project is located;

    l. The extent to which the project contributes to state or local emergency preparedness and disaster resilience;

    m. The ability of the project to improve electric reliability in the region by balancing or spacing the timing of electrical loads on the grid;

    n. The extent to which the project proposal includes necessary electrical infrastructure upgrades or improves local electrical grid capacity for future projects; and

    o. The alignment of the proposed project with other major capital projects planned for the campus in order to achieve efficiencies and related cost savings when possible.

4. The committee may prioritize projects that address systems that are at the end of their expected useful life or are at risk of imminent failure.

5. The committee must review related project information produced by the energy life-cycle cost analysis conducted under chapter 39.35 RCW if available. In addition, the committee must share project proposal information with the department of enterprise services for use in the energy life-cycle cost analysis, if the analysis is required, in order to avoid duplication of effort.

6. The committee and the department may request additional information from agencies that submitted plans under RCW 19.27A.260 in order to validate data used in the prioritization framework developed under this section.

7. When developing and finalizing each recommended funding list, the committee must consider: (a) The need to balance long-term system planning and growth priorities for state entities; (b) the need to balance major capital project requests for design and construction funding, given the fiscal impact of funded design projects on the state's overall capital budget; and (c) the need to balance state capital funding between design and construction project phases to meet state priorities and associated deadlines established in this chapter and RCW 70A.45.050.

## Section 4
1. A preliminary report describing the draft prioritization framework and scoring criteria is due to the governor and the legislature by December 30, 2026. The preliminary report must include information collected from decarbonization plans received by the department under RCW 19.27A.260 that contain, at a minimum, complete information regarding:

    a. Project elements that can be developed as discrete modules or phases;

    b. Greenhouse gas emission reduction or energy savings estimates;

    c. Project cost estimates; and

    d. Estimates of construction schedules or the amount of time required to complete project phases.

        i. A prioritized list of capital projects related to state campus district energy systems recommended for funding in the subsequent biennial capital budget. The prioritized project list must group projects into the following categories for funding: (A) Feasibility studies, demonstration projects, and predevelopment activities; (B) design and construction for discrete project phases or complete projects; (C) minor works for the repair or replacement of project elements that will be a part of or connected to the completed campus decarbonization project; and

        ii. An analysis of barriers to state agencies entering into energy as a service contracts as authorized under RCW 39.35C.050 or participating in public-private partnerships, and recommendations for legislation to facilitate agencies' use of these models.

    b. If a project that was ranked in the top 35 percent of the most recent past recommended list was not funded by the legislature, the committee must retain that project's ranked position on the next recommended project list unless the committee determines that adjusting the project ranking is warranted based on the best available information.

    c. The committee may submit a supplemental prioritized list of emergent projects by November 15th of an odd-numbered year for consideration by the governor and legislature for funding in a supplemental capital budget.
