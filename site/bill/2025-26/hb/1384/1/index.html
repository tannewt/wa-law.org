<li>
<p>Except as provided in (d) of this subsection, there is hereby imposed upon all wines except cider sold to wine distributors within the state a tax at the rate of twenty and one-fourth cents per liter.

Except as provided in (d) of this subsection, there is hereby imposed on all cider sold to wine distributors within the state a tax at the rate of three and fifty-nine one-hundredths cents per liter. However, wine sold or shipped in bulk from one winery to another winery is not subject to such tax.</p>

Any such purchaser of wine whose applicable tax payment is not postmarked by the twentieth day following the month of purchase will be assessed a penalty at the rate of two percent a month or fraction thereof.

<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preference contained in section 1, chapter . . ., Laws of 2025 (section 1 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or to be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature categorizes this tax preference as one intended to provide tax relief to certain businesses and individuals and to create or retain jobs, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2) (c) and (e).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to promote the development of small wineries and the jobs they provide. These small businesses face challenges entering and surviving in the industry and it is the legislature's public policy objective to assist these wineries to grow and stabilize. Small wineries do not benefit from the economies of scale and product distribution networks available to large wineries. Small wineries have faced significant recent and ongoing challenges, including the great recession, COVID-19 pandemic, and climate change impacts, such as increased wildfire smoke and extreme weather events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a review finds that the tax preference accomplishes its goal of promoting small wineries, measured by an increase in the number of Washington wineries in business, an increase in the number of wine industry jobs, or an increase in wine excise taxes collected, compared to the end of the 2024 state fiscal year, then the legislature intends to extend the expiration date of this tax preference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may refer to any data collected by the state, including the Washington wine commission.</p>
</li>
