    d. That no law prohibits the delegation;

    e. That the person to whom the task will be delegated is competent to perform that task; and

        ii. That results of the task are reasonably predictable;

        iii. That the task can be performed without a need for complex observations or critical decisions;

        iv. That the task can be performed without repeated clinical assessments; and

    v.(A) For a medical assistant other than a medical assistant-hemodialysis technician, that the task, if performed improperly, would not present life-threatening consequences or the danger of immediate and serious harm to the patient; and

(B) For a medical assistant-hemodialysis technician, that the task, if performed improperly, is not likely to present life-threatening consequences or the danger of immediate and serious harm to the patient.

2. Nothing in this section prohibits the use of protocols that do not involve clinical judgment and do not involve the administration of medications, other than vaccines.

3. The entry and approval of orders by a medical assistant-certified in accordance with section 2 of this act is not considered a task that requires the exercise of judgment based on clinical experience.
