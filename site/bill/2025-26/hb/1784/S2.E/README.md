    d. That no law prohibits the delegation;

    e. That the person to whom the task will be delegated is competent to perform that task; and

        iv. That the task can be performed without repeated clinical assessments; and

2. Nothing in this section prohibits the use of protocols that do not involve clinical judgment and do not involve the administration of medications, other than vaccines.

3. The entry and activation of orders by a medical assistant-certified in accordance with section 2 of this act is not considered a task that requires the exercise of judgment based on clinical experience.
