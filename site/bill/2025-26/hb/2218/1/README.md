[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2218.pdf)

## Section 1
1. [Empty]

    a. The legislature finds that high quality medical treatment and adherence to occupational health best practices can prevent disability and reduce loss of family income for workers, and lower labor and insurance costs for employers. Injured workers deserve high quality medical care in accordance with current health care best practices. To this end, the department shall establish minimum standards for providers who treat workers from both state fund and self-insured employers. The department shall establish a health care provider network to treat injured workers, and shall accept providers into the network who meet those minimum standards. The department shall convene an advisory group made up of representatives from or designees of the workers' compensation advisory committee and the industrial insurance medical and chiropractic advisory committees to consider and advise the department related to implementation of this section, including development of best practices treatment guidelines for providers in the network. The department shall also seek the input of various health care provider groups and associations concerning the network's implementation.

    b. Network providers must , when medically appropriate as determined by the provider, follow the department's evidence-based coverage decisions and treatment guidelines, policies, and must , when medically appropriate as determined by the provider, follow other national treatment guidelines appropriate for their patient.

    c. The department, in collaboration with the advisory group, shall also establish additional best practice standards for providers to qualify for a second tier within the network, based on demonstrated use of occupational health best practices. This second tier is separate from and in addition to the centers for occupational health and education established under subsection (5) of this section.

    a. [Empty]

        i. Upon the occurrence of any injury to a worker entitled to compensation under the provisions of this title, the worker shall receive proper and necessary medical and surgical services at the hands of a physician, osteopathic physician, chiropractor, naturopath, podiatric physician, optometrist, dentist, licensed advanced registered nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or psychologist in claims solely for mental health conditions, of the worker's own choice, if conveniently located, except as provided in (b) of this subsection, and proper and necessary hospital care and services during the period of the worker's disability from such injury.

        ii. Upon notice of an injury, an employer must inform the injured worker that the worker has a right to seek medical treatment with a provider of the worker's own choice. An employer is prohibited from requiring, or in any way inducing, an injured worker to seek medical treatment from a specific provider or clinic. The department shall investigate any allegation that an employer attempted to require or induce an injured worker to seek treatment from a specific provider or clinic. Any violation of this subsection (2)(a)(ii) by a self-insured employer is a per se violation of RCW 51.14.180. Any violation by other employers of this subsection (2)(a)(ii) subjects the employer to a penalty pursuant to RCW 51.28.025(2).

    b. Except as provided in (g) of this subsection, once the provider network is established in the worker's geographic area, an injured worker may receive care from a nonnetwork provider only for an initial office or emergency room visit. However, the department or self-insurer may limit reimbursement to the department's standard fee for the services. The provider must comply with all applicable billing policies and must accept the department's fee schedule as payment in full.

    c. The department, in collaboration with the advisory group, shall adopt policies for the development, credentialing, accreditation, and continued oversight of a network of health care providers approved to treat injured workers. Health care providers shall apply to the network by completing the department's provider application which shall have the force of a contract with the department to treat injured workers. The advisory group shall recommend minimum network standards for the department to approve a provider's application, to remove a provider from the network, or to require peer review such as, but not limited to:

        i. Current malpractice insurance coverage exceeding a dollar amount threshold, number, or seriousness of malpractice suits over a specific time frame;

        ii. Previous malpractice judgments or settlements that do not exceed a dollar amount threshold recommended by the advisory group, or a specific number or seriousness of malpractice suits over a specific time frame;

        iii. No licensing or disciplinary action in any jurisdiction or loss of treating or admitting privileges by any board, commission, agency, public or private health care payer, or hospital;

        iv. For some specialties such as surgeons, privileges in at least one hospital;

    v. Whether the provider has been credentialed by another health plan that follows national quality assurance guidelines; and

    vi. Alternative criteria for providers that are not credentialed by another health plan.

The department shall develop alternative criteria for providers that are not credentialed by another health plan or as needed to address access to care concerns in certain regions.

    d. Network provider contracts will automatically renew at the end of the contract period unless the department provides written notice of changes in contract provisions or the department or provider provides written notice of contract termination. The industrial insurance medical advisory committee shall develop criteria for removal of a provider from the network to be presented to the department and advisory group for consideration in the development of contract terms.

    e. In order to monitor quality of care and assure efficient management of the provider network, the department shall establish additional criteria and terms for network participation including, but not limited to, requiring compliance with administrative and billing policies.

    f. The advisory group shall recommend best practices standards to the department to use in determining second tier network providers. The department shall develop and implement financial and nonfinancial incentives for network providers who qualify for the second tier. The department is authorized to certify and decertify second tier providers.

    g. If a worker is unable to find a provider in the medical provider network who is willing to treat the worker within 15 miles of the worker's home, the worker may provide notice of this fact to the department or self-insured employer. Within seven calendar days of receiving such notice, the department or self-insured employer shall send the worker a declaration developed by the department to sign certifying this fact. Upon signing and returning the declaration, or if the department or self-insured employer fails to send the declaration within seven calendar days, the worker may seek treatment from a nonnetwork provider if the provider agrees to be paid in accordance with the department's fee schedule. The department or self-insured employer shall pay for such proper and necessary treatment.

3. [Empty]

    a. The department shall work with self-insurers and the department utilization review provider to implement utilization review for the self-insured community to ensure consistent quality, cost-effective care for all injured workers and employers, and to reduce administrative burden for providers.

    b. Any utilization review must be completed within 10 business days of the date the department received a request for approval of treatment on behalf of an injured worker or the treatment must be authorized.

4. [Empty]

    a. The department for state fund claims shall pay, in accordance with the department's fee schedule, for any alleged injury for which a worker files a claim, any initial prescription drugs provided in relation to that initial visit, without regard to whether the worker's claim for benefits is allowed.

    b. In all accepted claims, treatment shall be limited in point of duration as follows:

        i. In the case of permanent partial disability, not to extend beyond the date when compensation shall be awarded the worker, except when the worker returned to work before permanent partial disability award is made, in such case not to extend beyond the time when monthly allowances to the worker shall cease.

        ii. In the case of temporary disability not to extend beyond the time when monthly allowances to the worker shall cease: PROVIDED, That after any injured worker has returned to the worker's work , the worker's medical and surgical treatment may be continued if, and so long as, such continuation is deemed necessary by the supervisor of industrial insurance to be necessary to the worker's more complete recovery.

        iii. In the case of a permanent total disability not to extend beyond the date on which a lump sum settlement is made with the worker, or the worker is placed upon the permanent pension roll: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That the supervisor of industrial insurance, solely in the supervisor's discretion, in all cases of permanent partial disability or permanent total disability, may authorize continued medical and surgical treatment for conditions previously accepted by the department when such medical and surgical treatment is deemed necessary by the supervisor of industrial insurance to protect such worker's life or provide for the administration of medical and therapeutic measures including payment of prescription medications, but not including those controlled substances currently scheduled by the pharmacy quality assurance commission as Schedule I, II, III, or IV substances under chapter 69.50 RCW, which are necessary to alleviate continuing pain which results from the industrial injury.

        iv. Provided, that where cancer is an accepted diagnosis, the department or self-insured employer, as the case may be, shall continue to pay for monitoring of the diagnosis at a frequency recommended by the worker's treating oncologist. The monitoring must include all necessary diagnostic studies and associated medical consultations.

    c. The supervisor of industrial insurance, the supervisor's designee, or a self-insurer, in their sole discretion, may authorize inoculation or other immunological treatment in cases in which a work-related activity has resulted in probable exposure of the worker to a potential infectious occupational disease. Authorization of such treatment does not bind the department or self-insurer in any adjudication of a claim by the same worker or the worker's beneficiary for an occupational disease.

    d. Nothing in this section prevents a worker from reopening the worker's claim pursuant to RCW 51.32.160.

5. [Empty]

    a. The legislature finds that the department and its business and labor partners have collaborated in establishing centers for occupational health and education to promote best practices and prevent preventable disability by focusing additional provider-based resources during the first twelve weeks following an injury. The centers for occupational health and education represent innovative accountable care systems in an early stage of development consistent with national health care reform efforts. Many Washington workers do not yet have access to these innovative health care delivery models.

    b. To expand evidence-based occupational health best practices, the department shall establish additional centers for occupational health and education, with the goal of extending access to at least fifty percent of injured and ill workers by December 2013 and to all injured workers by December 2015. The department shall also develop additional best practices and incentives that span the entire period of recovery, not only the first twelve weeks.

    c. The department shall certify and decertify centers for occupational health and education based on criteria including institutional leadership and geographic areas covered by the center for occupational health and education, occupational health leadership and education, mix of participating health care providers necessary to address the anticipated needs of injured workers, health services coordination to deliver occupational health best practices, indicators to measure the success of the center for occupational health and education, and agreement that the center's providers shall, if feasible, treat certain injured workers if referred by the department or a self-insurer.

    d. Health care delivery organizations may apply to the department for certification as a center for occupational health and education. These may include, but are not limited to, hospitals and affiliated clinics and providers, multispecialty clinics, health maintenance organizations, and organized systems of network physicians.

    e. The centers for occupational health and education shall implement benchmark quality indicators of occupational health best practices for individual providers, developed in collaboration with the department. A center for occupational health and education shall remove individual providers who do not consistently meet these quality benchmarks.

    f. The department shall develop and implement financial and nonfinancial incentives for center for occupational health and education providers that are based on progressive and measurable gains in occupational health best practices, and that are applicable throughout the duration of an injured or ill worker's episode of care.

    g. The department shall develop electronic methods of tracking evidence-based quality measures to identify and improve outcomes for injured workers at risk of developing prolonged disability. In addition, these methods must be used to provide systematic feedback to physicians regarding quality of care, to conduct appropriate objective evaluation of progress in the centers for occupational health and education, and to allow efficient coordination of services.

6. [Empty]

    a. If a provider fails to meet the minimum network standards established in subsection (2) of this section, the department is authorized to remove the provider from the network or take other appropriate action regarding a provider's participation. The department may also require remedial steps as a condition for a provider to participate in the network. The department, with input from the advisory group, shall establish waiting periods that may be imposed before a provider who has been denied or removed from the network may reapply.

    b. The department may permanently remove a provider from the network or take other appropriate action when the provider exhibits a pattern of conduct of low quality care that exposes patients to risk of physical or psychiatric harm or death. Patterns that qualify as risk of harm include, but are not limited to, poor health care outcomes evidenced by increased, chronic, or prolonged pain or decreased function due to treatments that have not been shown to be curative, safe, or effective or for which it has been shown that the risks of harm exceed the benefits that can be reasonably expected based on peer-reviewed opinion.

    c. The department may not remove a health care provider from the network for an isolated instance of poor health and recovery outcomes due to treatment by the provider.

    d. When the department terminates a provider from the network, the department or self-insurer shall assist an injured worker currently under the provider's care in identifying a new network provider or providers from whom the worker can select an attending or treating provider. In such a case, the department or self-insurer shall notify the injured worker that the worker must choose a new attending or treating provider.

    e. Any action taken by the department to remove a provider or terminate a provider from the network must be done in writing. The provider may appeal such action to the board of industrial insurance appeals pursuant to chapter 51.52 RCW.

7. The department may adopt rules related to this section.
