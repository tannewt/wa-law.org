<p>THE PURCHASER OF THIS UNIT WILL BE REQUIRED TO BE A MEMBER OF THE ASSOCIATION AND WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this chapter, a reasonable charge to the owner for the preparation of a resale certificate may not exceed $275, covering the direct out-of-pocket cost of copying and providing such information, and may not include any additional charges for providing documents that are maintained in electronic form on a website, web portal, or application available to unit owners. However, an association may charge an additional $100 for a rush service that must be completed within 72 hours of submission of a resale certificate request. The association may also charge a unit owner a nominal fee not to exceed $100 for updating a resale certificate within six months of the unit owner's previous resale certificate request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An association may not require a unit owner to contract with or establish an account with a third party in order to provide payment for or accept delivery of a resale certificate required to be furnished under (a) of this subsection.</p>
