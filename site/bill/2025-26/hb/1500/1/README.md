THE PURCHASER OF THIS UNIT WILL BE REQUIRED TO BE A MEMBER OF THE ASSOCIATION AND WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS.

THE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS WILL IMPOSE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS UPON THE OWNER OF THE UNIT, INCLUDING AN OBLIGATION TO PAY ASSESSMENTS TO THE ASSOCIATION WHICH MAY INCLUDE REGULAR AND SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS, FINES, FEES, INTEREST, LATE CHARGES, AND COSTS OF COLLECTION, INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES.

THE ASSOCIATION HAS A STATUTORY LIEN ON EACH INDIVIDUAL UNIT FOR ANY UNPAID ASSESSMENT FROM THE TIME IT IS DUE. FAILURE TO PAY ASSESSMENTS COULD RESULT IN THE FILING OF A LIEN ON THE UNIT AND LOSS OF THE UNIT THROUGH FORECLOSURE.

THE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS MAY PROHIBIT OWNERS FROM MAKING CHANGES TO THE UNIT WITHOUT REVIEW AND THE APPROVAL OF THE ASSOCIATION, AND MAY ALSO IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF THE UNIT, DISPLAY OF SIGNS, CERTAIN BEHAVIORS, AND OTHER ITEMS.

PURCHASERS OF THIS UNIT SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS OF MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION, THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ASSOCIATION'S FINANCES, THE CURRENT RESERVE STUDY, IF ANY, THE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS, AND THE OTHER INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN THE RESALE CERTIFICATE. THE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND CREATE BINDING LEGAL OBLIGATIONS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER SEEKING THE ASSISTANCE OF LEGAL COUNSEL."

    b. For the purposes of this chapter, a reasonable charge to the owner for the preparation of a resale certificate may not exceed $275, covering the direct out-of-pocket cost of copying and providing such information, and may not include any additional charges for providing documents that are maintained in electronic form on a website, web portal, or application available to unit owners. However, an association may charge an additional $100 for a rush service that must be completed within 72 hours of submission of a resale certificate request. The association may also charge a unit owner a nominal fee not to exceed $100 for updating a resale certificate within six months of the unit owner's previous resale certificate request.

    c. An association may not require a unit owner to contract with or establish an account with a third party in order to provide payment for or accept delivery of a resale certificate required to be furnished under (a) of this subsection.

    d. Fees for copying and providing documents required by this section must be distinguished from, separately stated from, and separately billed from, all other fees, fines, or assessments.

    e. A unit owner is not liable to the purchaser for any erroneous information provided by the association and included in the certificate.

3. A unit owner possessing current copies in electronic form of any documents specified by this section must provide them to a purchaser via electronic transmission at no cost.

    a. A purchaser is not liable for any of the following:

        i. Any unpaid assessment or fee greater than the amount set forth in the certificate prepared by the association; and

        ii. Any violation of the governing documents created by any alteration to a unit that, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have been known to the association or its authorized agent at the time of conveyance, but was not identified in the resale certificate.

    b. The purchaser may cancel a contract for the purchase of the unit within five days after first receiving the resale certificate. If the resale certificate is first provided to a purchaser more than five days before execution of a contract for the purchase of a unit, the purchaser does not have the right under this section to cancel the executed contract. If the resale certificate is first provided to a purchaser five days or less before the purchaser signs a contract for the purchase of a unit, the purchaser, before conveyance of the unit to the purchaser, may cancel the contract by delivering, no later than the fifth day after first receiving the resale certificate, a notice of cancellation to the seller. If the resale certificate is first provided to a purchaser less than five days before the closing date for the conveyance of that unit, the purchaser may, before conveyance of the unit to the purchaser, extend the closing date to a date not more than five days after the purchaser first received the resale certificate.
