<p>&quot;This association does not have a current reserve study. The lack of a current reserve study poses certain risks to you, the purchaser.

<p>The association, within 10 days after a request by a unit owner, and subject to the payment of any fees imposed pursuant to RCW 64.90.405(2)(m), must furnish a resale certificate signed by an officer or authorized agent of the association and containing the information necessary to enable the unit owner to comply with this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this chapter, a reasonable charge to the owner for the preparation of a resale certificate may not exceed $275, covering the direct out-of-pocket cost of copying and providing such information, and may not include any additional charges for providing documents that are maintained in electronic form on a website, web portal, or application available to unit owners. However, an association may charge an additional $100 for a rush service that must be completed within 72 hours of submission of a resale certificate request. The association may also charge a unit owner a nominal fee not to exceed $100 for updating a resale certificate within six months of the unit owner's previous resale certificate request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An association may not require a unit owner to contract with or establish an account with a third party in order to provide payment for or accept delivery of a resale certificate required to be furnished under (a) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fees for copying and providing documents required by this section must be distinguished from, separately stated from, and separately billed from, all other fees, fines, or assessments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A unit owner is not liable to the purchaser for any erroneous information provided by the association and included in the certificate.</p>

<li>
<p>The purchaser may cancel a contract for the purchase of the unit within five days after first receiving the resale certificate.

If the resale certificate is first provided to a purchaser five days or less before the purchaser signs a contract for the purchase of a unit, the purchaser, before conveyance of the unit to the purchaser, may cancel the contract by delivering, no later than the fifth day after first receiving the resale certificate, a notice of cancellation to the seller. If the resale certificate is first provided to a purchaser less than five days before the closing date for the conveyance of that unit, the purchaser may, before conveyance of the unit to the purchaser, extend the closing date to a date not more than five days after the purchaser first received the resale certificate.</p>
