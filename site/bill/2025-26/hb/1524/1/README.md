    d. Provide a panic button to each isolated employee. The department must publish advice and guidance for employers with fifty or fewer employees relating to this subsection (1)(d). This subsection (1)(d) does not apply to contracted security guard companies licensed under chapter 18.170 RCW.

    a. The department shall investigate any complaint filed with the department alleging a violation of this section, except the department may not investigate an alleged violation that occurred more than three years before the filing of the complaint.

    b. The department shall issue either a citation and notice of assessment or a determination of compliance, within 90 days after the date on which the department received the complaint, unless the complaint is otherwise resolved. The department may extend the period by providing advance written notice to the complainant and the employer setting forth good cause for an extension of the period and specifying the duration of the extension. If the department investigation finds that the complainant's allegation cannot be substantiated, the department shall issue a closure letter to the complainant and the employer detailing such finding.

    c. If the department finds a violation of this section, the department shall order the employer to pay the department a civil penalty. The maximum penalty is $1,000 for each violation, except the maximum penalty is increased to $2,500 for the fourth and subsequent violation. The department may, at any time, waive or reduce a civil penalty assessed under this section if the department determines that the employer has taken corrective action to resolve the violation. Monetary penalties collected under this section must be deposited into the general fund.
