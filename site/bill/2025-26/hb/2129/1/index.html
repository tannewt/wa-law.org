<p>The department shall seek to enhance, protect, and perpetuate the ability of the private sector to produce food and fiber. Additionally, the department shall seek, consistent with its regulatory responsibilities, to maintain the economic well-being of the agricultural industry and its dependent rural community in Washington state. Agritourism activities in accordance with section 2 of this act stabilize and help protect the economic well-being of the agricultural industry and shall be supported by the department's rules and programs.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Agritourism activities are authorized on lands zoned for agricultural production, on land where there is a farm or ranch, and on lands used for agricultural activities, and are not conditional uses requiring permits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Counties may not enact or enforce official controls, ordinances, or regulations that would prohibit or unreasonably restrict agritourism. Public health, safety, and building code provisions apply. These activities are not conditional uses that require the agricultural operator to pay the county fees or require approval from the county.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section, &quot;agritourism activity&quot; means any activity carried out on a farm or ranch whose primary business activity is agriculture or ranching and that allows members of the general public, for recreational, entertainment, or educational purposes, to view or enjoy rural activities including, but not limited to: Farming; ranching; historic, cultural, and on-site educational programs; recreational farming programs that may include on-site hospitality services; sales of products and food services; guided and self-guided tours; petting zoos; farm festivals and celebrations; corn mazes; harvest-your-own operations; hayrides, sleighrides, or other modes of travel to explore the farm; parties and events that occur within barns; horseback riding; fishing; and camping.</p>

<p>Each county that is required or chooses to plan under RCW 36.70A.040, and each city within such county, shall adopt development regulations on or before September 1, 1991, to assure the conservation of agricultural, forest, and mineral resource lands designated under RCW 36.70A.170. Regulations adopted under this subsection may not prohibit uses legally existing on any parcel prior to their adoption and shall remain in effect until the county or city adopts development regulations pursuant to RCW 36.70A.040. Such regulations shall assure that the use of lands adjacent to agricultural, forest, or mineral resource lands shall not interfere with the continued use, in the accustomed manner and in accordance with best management practices, of these designated lands for the production of food, agricultural products, or timber, or for the extraction of minerals. Agritourism activities are authorized on agricultural lands, must be fortified by counties and cities in compliance with section 2 of this act, and are consistent with conserving agricultural lands. Any county located to the west of the crest of the Cascade mountains that has both a population of at least four hundred thousand and a border that touches another state, and any city in such county, may adopt development regulations to assure that agriculture, forest, and mineral resource lands adjacent to short line railroads may be developed for freight rail dependent uses.</p>

<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A county or a city may use a variety of innovative zoning techniques in areas designated as agricultural lands of long-term commercial significance under RCW 36.70A.170. The innovative zoning techniques should be designed to conserve agricultural lands and encourage the agricultural economy. Agritourism activities fortify the agricultural economy and are consistent with conserving agricultural lands. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, a county or city should encourage nonagricultural uses to be limited to lands with poor soils or otherwise not suitable for agricultural purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Innovative zoning techniques a county or city may consider include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Agricultural zoning, which limits the density of development and restricts or prohibits nonfarm uses of agricultural land and may allow accessory uses, including nonagricultural accessory uses and activities, that support, promote, or sustain agricultural operations and production, as provided in subsection (3) of this section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cluster zoning, which allows new development on one portion of the land, leaving the remainder in agricultural or open space uses;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Large lot zoning, which establishes as a minimum lot size the amount of land necessary to achieve a successful farming practice;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quarter/quarter zoning, which permits one residential dwelling on a one-acre minimum lot for each one-sixteenth of a section of land; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sliding scale zoning, which allows the number of lots for single-family residential purposes with a minimum lot size of one acre to increase inversely as the size of the total acreage increases.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accessory uses allowed under subsection (2)(a) of this section shall comply with the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Accessory uses shall be located, designed, and operated so as to not interfere with, and to support the continuation of, the overall agricultural use of the property and neighboring properties, and shall comply with the requirements of this chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accessory uses may include:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Agricultural accessory uses and activities, including but not limited to the storage, distribution, and marketing of regional agricultural products from one or more producers, agriculturally related experiences, or the production, marketing, and distribution of value-added agricultural products, including support services that facilitate these activities; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nonagricultural accessory uses and activities as long as they are consistent with the size, scale, and intensity of the existing agricultural use of the property and the existing buildings on the site. Nonagricultural accessory uses and activities, including new buildings, parking, or supportive uses, shall not be located outside the general area already developed for buildings and residential uses and shall not otherwise convert more than one acre of agricultural land to nonagricultural uses; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Counties and cities have the authority to limit or exclude accessory uses otherwise authorized in this subsection (3) in areas designated as agricultural lands of long-term commercial significance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section shall not be interpreted to limit agricultural production on designated agricultural lands or regulate agritourism activities in a manner inconsistent with section 2 of this act.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-6">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6">¶</a></h2>
<p>The department of commerce is directed to immediately modify rules or guidance documents that are not consistent with the provisions of this act or restrict agritourism activities.</p>
<h2 id="section-7">Section 7 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7">¶</a></h2>
<p>If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.</p>
