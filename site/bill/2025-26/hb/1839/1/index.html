<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington is facing a critical workforce gap in an economy where the state is poised to see growing demand for eligible employees trained in a variety of industry sectors, including advanced computing and technology, construction and skilled trades, health care, education, business and management, and clean technology. According to a 2024 report published by the Washington roundtable, the state's anticipated job growth is 12.8 percent, well above the national average of 2.8 percent, creating opportunity for skilled workers. Three quarters of jobs will require postsecondary credentials. However, Washington faces a projected shortfall of nearly 600,000 credentialed workers over the decade, including 301,000 with bachelor's and advanced degrees, 67,000 with associate degrees, and 228,000 with certifications, apprenticeships, and other training credentials.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature finds it necessary to grow investments in workforce education and finds that additional resources would be best guided towards expanding the Washington college grant program to families earning 70 percent of the median family income, increasing the number of teacher training and STEM teacher training programs, growing the number of in-state student seats in our institutions of higher education, and funding work-study salaries for students doing STEM research.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>(1)(a) Beginning with business activities occurring on or after April 1, 2020, in addition to the taxes imposed under RCW 82.04.290(2), a workforce education investment surcharge is imposed on select advanced computing businesses. The surcharge is equal to the gross income of the business subject to the tax under RCW 82.04.290(2), multiplied by the rate of 1.22 percent.</p>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<p>This act takes effect October 1, 2025.</p>
