<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes that members of the Washington national guard serve in both a federal and state capacity. This dual mission is at the core of the citizen soldier's response to the national defense as well as the needs of Washington state during emergencies and disasters. The legislature intends to ensure the same protections afforded to service members who are victims of a crime while in federal status exist when the same members of our national guard are serving in a state capacity. Alignment between the federal uniform code of military justice and the Washington code of military justice is necessary for crime victims to receive the same universal basic rights. Furthermore, consistency between the federal and state military codes and alignment to state law also provides clear guidelines and standards for commanders regarding victims' rights, ensuring consistency in treatment of victims and processing of cases by leaders across the various commands of the Washington air and army national guard.</p>
