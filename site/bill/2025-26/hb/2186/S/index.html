<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the state would economically benefit by increasing the ability of Washington communities to access federal funds.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that, in the last 10 years, thousands of federal funding opportunities were available for economic development, including broadband, equity, housing, infrastructure, innovation, regional development, skills training, transportation, and workforce development, although the federal funding opportunities available in each fiscal year vary depending on federal priorities. In the last three fiscal years, the federal government provided $1.1 trillion per year in grants for projects that support economic development.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that a state program that creates scoring criteria to prioritize the award of matching funds, adopts award tiers, and establishes a state account to create a pool of matching dollars, including private donations, will enhance the ability of local communities to access federal funds that will contribute to the state's economic development, including funds for education, public safety, housing, transportation, and child care.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that the state recognized the value of matching dollars to access federal funds for clean energy, climate, clean technology, and resilience, and that it should expand its efforts to include all of the federal government's economic development fund opportunities.</p>
<p>To further promote economic development in local communities, the legislature encourages the department of commerce to solicit private donations to support economic development, and to reallocate program funds that would otherwise revert at the end of the fiscal biennium to the program created in this act to be used as matching funds for applications for federal grants.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>

<li>
<p>Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the department shall make available, within existing resources, an inventory of grant opportunities for state agencies, local governments, and other community organizations engaged in economic development activities.</p>

<li>
<p>Beginning in 2027, each fiscal biennium, the department shall solicit input from associate development organizations, ports, chambers of commerce, workforce development boards, state agencies, local governments, and the governor's office to identify the federal funds that will likely be available in the biennium and to prioritize the federal funds that will have the most significant impact on economic development in Washington.</p>
</li>
