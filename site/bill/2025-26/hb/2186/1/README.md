# HB 2186 - Federal funds

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2186.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that the state would economically benefit by increasing the ability of Washington communities to access federal funds.

The legislature further finds that, in the last 10 years, thousands of federal funding opportunities were available for economic development, including broadband, equity, housing, infrastructure, innovation, regional development, skills training, transportation, and workforce development, although the federal funding opportunities available in each fiscal year vary depending on federal priorities. In the last three fiscal years, the federal government provided $1.1 trillion per year in grants for projects that support economic development.

The legislature further finds that a state program that creates scoring criteria to prioritize the award of matching funds, adopts award tiers, and establishes a state account to create a pool of matching dollars, including private donations, will enhance the ability of local communities to access federal funds that will contribute to the state's economic development, including funds for education, public safety, housing, transportation, and child care.

The legislature further finds that the state recognized the value of matching dollars to access federal funds for clean energy, climate, clean technology, and resilience, and that it should expand its efforts to include all of the federal government's economic development fund opportunities.

To further promote economic development in local communities, the legislature encourages the department of commerce to solicit private donations to support economic development, and to reallocate program funds that would otherwise revert at the end of the fiscal biennium to the program created in this act to be used as matching funds for applications for federal grants.

## Section 2
1. The department shall make available, within existing resources, an inventory of grant opportunities for state agencies, local governments, and other community organizations engaged in economic development activities.

2. In developing the inventory of economic development grant opportunities, the department shall:

    a. Regularly review the federal register for opportunities to apply for grants, research projects, and demonstration projects;

    b. Maintain an inventory of grant opportunities with private foundations and businesses; and

    c.

Consult with federal officials, including but not limited to those in the small business administration, the department of labor, the department of commerce, the department of agriculture, the department of ecology, as well as private foundations and businesses, on the prospects for obtaining federal and private funds for economic development purposes in Washington state.

3. The department may also facilitate joint efforts between agencies and between local organizations and state agencies that will increase the likelihood of success in grant seeking .

## Section 3
1. An applicant for federal funds that will promote economic development may request a letter of support from the department. The department shall provide the applicant with a letter that identifies the state's opportunity for matching funds for the application within five business days of the request.

2. Each fiscal biennium, the department shall solicit input from associate development organizations, ports, chambers of commerce, workforce development boards, state agencies, local governments, and the governor's office to identify the federal funds that will likely be available in the biennium and to prioritize the federal funds that will have the most significant impact on economic development in Washington.

3. Subject to available funds, the department shall develop scoring criteria to prioritize and award matching funds to an applicant with a letter of opportunity for matching funds. The scoring criteria must include:

    a. The economic impact of the federal funds, including the number of jobs created, households affected, and businesses impacted;

    b. The amount of the federal funding available if the application is successful;

    c. Whether the application meets one of the priorities identified in subsection (2) of this section;

    d. A prioritization of applications from applicants in rural and frontier counties; and

    e. Criteria developed by the department including, but not limited to, collaborative efforts and projects, timing of available funds, and alignment with state priorities.

4. The department shall only award matching funds when:

    a. The applicant is unable to secure funding from other state sources;

    b. The project will produce long-term economic benefits;

    b. Investor-owned utilities and other applicants may receive a maximum of 50 percent of the required match.

    c. If no match is required, an applicant may receive up to $100,000 if the amount would increase the likelihood of receiving federal funds or increase the award of federal funds.

    d. If a project will benefit a distressed area as defined in RCW 43.168.020, the maximum amount awarded under (b) of this subsection may be increased to 100 percent, and the maximum amount awarded under (c) of this subsection may be increased to $500,000.
