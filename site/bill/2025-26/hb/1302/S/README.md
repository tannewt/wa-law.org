# HB 1302 - Utility connection charges

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1302-S.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that climate change and environmental degradation poses a significant and increasing threat to human health in Washington. This threat cannot be combatted through reductions in greenhouse gas and other harmful emissions alone. Instead, reductions must be combined with technological innovations in clean energy, resource efficiency, and other environmentally friendly practices.

The legislature finds that industrial symbiosis is one such innovation and practice. Industrial symbiosis is characterized by the beneficial utilization of waste products that may otherwise have deleterious environmental effects. Industrial symbiosis reduces waste, increases efficiency, promotes resiliency, and creates the conditions for further innovation.

The legislature believes that by allowing local governments that operate their own utilities to waive connection charges for organizations practicing industrial symbiosis, Washington can encourage the development and utilization of this sustainable technology, and that such utilization is important both environmentally and economically.

## Section 2
1. [Empty]

    a. Municipal utilities formed under this chapter may waive connection charges for properties owned or developed by, or on the behalf of, a nonprofit organization, public development authority, housing authority, or local agency that provides emergency shelter, transitional housing, permanent supportive housing, or affordable housing, including a limited partnership as described in RCW 84.36.560(7)(f)(ii) and a limited liability company as described in RCW 84.36.560(7)(f)(iii).

    d. "Industrial symbiosis" means collaboration among businesses or organizations to exchange materials, energy, water, and byproducts in order to optimize resource use and enhance environmental, economic, and social outcomes for projects that demonstrate measurable reductions in resource consumption or greenhouse gas emissions while supporting sustainable development and long-term community benefits.

## Section 3
Whenever a city or town waives or delays collection of tap-in charges, connection fees, or hookup fees for low-income persons, a class of low-income persons, or a nonprofit organization, public development authority, housing authority, or local agency that provides emergency shelter, transitional housing, permanent supportive housing, or affordable housing as defined in RCW 35.92.385, or an organization utilizing the property for industrial symbiosis as defined in RCW 35.92.385 to connect to lines or pipes used by the city or town to provide utility service, the waiver or delay shall be pursuant to a program established by ordinance.
