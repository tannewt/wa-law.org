    a. The purchaser or transferee produces a valid permit to purchase firearms under section 2 of this act;

    b. The dealer is notified by the Washington state patrol firearms background check program that the purchaser or transferee is eligible to possess a firearm under state and federal law; and

    c. The requirements and time periods in RCW 9.41.092 have been satisfied.

2. In determining whether the purchaser or transferee is eligible to possess a firearm, the Washington state patrol firearms background check program shall check with the national instant criminal background check system, provided for by the Brady handgun violence prevention act (18 U.S.C. Sec. 921 et seq.), the Washington state patrol electronic database, the health care authority electronic database, the administrative office of the courts, LInX-NW, and with other agencies or resources as appropriate, to determine whether the applicant is ineligible under RCW 9.41.040 to possess a firearm.

3. [Empty]

    a. In any case where there is an outstanding warrant for the applicant's arrest from any court of competent jurisdiction for a felony or misdemeanor, the Washington state patrol firearms background check program shall advise the dealer that the delivery of the firearm is delayed. The Washington state patrol firearms background check program shall confirm the existence of outstanding warrants after notification of the application to purchase a firearm is received. Upon confirming that the warrant is valid, the Washington state patrol firearms background check program will advise the dealer that transfer of the firearm is denied.

    b. The Washington state patrol firearms background check program shall notify the dealer that delivery of the firearm must be delayed in any case where it cannot confirm the applicant's identity or determine the applicant's eligibility to purchase and possess a firearm due to disposition records in this state or elsewhere reflecting: (i) Open criminal charges; (ii) pending criminal charges; (iii) pending commitment proceedings; or (iv) an arrest for an offense making a person ineligible to possess a firearm under RCW 9.41.040.

4. [Empty]

    a. At the time of applying for the purchase of a firearm, the applicant shall provide the firearm dealer the application information necessary to submit the background check to the Washington state patrol background check system, including:

        ii. The date and hour of the application;

        iii. The applicant's driver's license number or state identification card number;

        iv. The identification number of the applicant's permit to purchase firearms;

    b. The dealer shall provide the applicant with information that contains two warnings substantially stated as follows:

        i. CAUTION: Although state and local laws do not differ, federal law and state law on the possession of firearms differ. If you are prohibited by federal law from possessing a firearm, you may be prosecuted in federal court. State permission to purchase a firearm is not a defense to a federal prosecution; and

        ii. CAUTION: The presence of a firearm in the home has been associated with an increased risk of death to self and others, including an increased risk of suicide, death during domestic violence incidents, and unintentional deaths to children and others.

The applicant shall be given a copy of the department of fish and wildlife pamphlet on the legal limits of the use of firearms and firearms safety.

    c. The dealer shall transmit the information from the application through secure automated firearms e-check (SAFE) to the Washington state patrol firearms background check program.

    d. The dealer shall deliver the firearm to the purchaser or transferee once the requirements and period of time specified in this chapter are satisfied.

If a person is determined to be ineligible, the Washington state patrol firearms background check program shall revoke the permit under subsection (14) of this section, and provide notification of the revocation and relevant information to the chief of police or the sheriff of the jurisdiction in which the permit holder resides so that local law enforcement may take steps to ensure the permit holder is not illegally in possession of firearms.
