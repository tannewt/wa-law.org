    a. The purchaser or transferee produces a valid permit to purchase firearms under section 2 of this act;

    b. The dealer is notified by the Washington state patrol firearms background check program that the purchaser or transferee is eligible to possess a firearm under state and federal law; and

    c. The requirements and time periods in RCW 9.41.092 have been satisfied.

2. In determining whether the purchaser or transferee is eligible to possess a firearm, the Washington state patrol firearms background check program shall check with the national instant criminal background check system, provided for by the Brady handgun violence prevention act (18 U.S.C. Sec. 921 et seq.), the Washington state patrol electronic database, the health care authority electronic database, the administrative office of the courts, LInX-NW, and with other agencies or resources as appropriate, to determine whether the applicant is ineligible under RCW 9.41.040 to possess a firearm.

    a. In any case where the applicant has an outstanding warrant for his or her arrest from any court of competent jurisdiction for a felony or misdemeanor, the Washington state patrol firearms background check program shall advise the dealer that the delivery of the firearm is delayed. The Washington state patrol firearms background check program shall confirm the existence of outstanding warrants after notification of the application to purchase a firearm is received. Upon confirming that the warrant is valid, the Washington state patrol firearms background check program will advise the dealer that transfer of the firearm is denied.

    b. In any case where the Washington state patrol firearms background check program has reasonable grounds based on the following circumstances: (i) Open criminal charges, (ii) pending criminal proceedings, (iii) pending commitment proceedings, or (iv) an arrest for an offense making a person ineligible under RCW 9.41.040 to possess a firearm, if the records of disposition have not yet been reported or entered sufficiently to determine eligibility to purchase or receive a firearm, the Washington state patrol firearms background check program shall notify the dealer that delivery of the firearm is delayed in order to confirm existing records in this state or elsewhere or to confirm the identity of the applicant.

    a. At the time of applying for the purchase of a firearm, the applicant shall provide the firearm dealer the application information necessary to submit the background check to the Washington state patrol background check system, including:

        i. CAUTION: Although state and local laws do not differ, federal law and state law on the possession of firearms differ. If you are prohibited by federal law from possessing a firearm, you may be prosecuted in federal court. State permission to purchase a firearm is not a defense to a federal prosecution; and

        ii. CAUTION: The presence of a firearm in the home has been associated with an increased risk of death to self and others, including an increased risk of suicide, death during domestic violence incidents, and unintentional deaths to children and others.

If a person is determined to be ineligible, the Washington state patrol firearms background check program shall revoke the permit under subsection (14) of this section, and provide notification of the revocation and relevant information to the chief of police or the sheriff of the jurisdiction in which the permit holder resides so that local law enforcement may take steps to ensure the permit holder is not illegally in possession of firearms.

    a. The issuing authority shall conduct a check through the national instant criminal background check system, the Washington state patrol electronic database, the administrative office of the courts, LInX-NW, the health care authority electronic database, and with other agencies or resources as appropriate, to determine whether the applicant is ineligible under RCW 9.41.040 or 9.41.045 to possess a firearm, or is prohibited from possessing a firearm under federal or state law, and therefore ineligible for a concealed pistol license.

    b. The issuing authority shall deny a license to anyone who is found to be prohibited from possessing a firearm under federal or state law or otherwise disqualified from obtaining a concealed pistol license under the requirements of this section.

    c. (a) and (b) of this subsection apply whether the applicant is applying for a new concealed pistol license or to renew a concealed pistol license.

If the applicant seeks to amend or correct their record, the applicant must contact the Washington state patrol for a Washington state record or the federal bureau of investigation for records from other jurisdictions. An applicant presenting a valid permit to purchase firearms is exempt from the fingerprint check requirement in a concealed pistol license application.

    e. If an application for a concealed pistol license is denied, the issuing authority shall send the applicant a written notice of the denial stating the specific grounds on which the application is denied. If the applicant provides an email address at the time of application, the issuing authority may send the denial notice to the applicant's email address.

4. The license application shall bear the full name, residential address, telephone number at the option of the applicant, email address at the option of the applicant, date and place of birth, race, gender, physical description, a complete set of fingerprints unless the applicant presents a valid permit to purchase firearms issued under section 2 of this act,  signature of the licensee, and the licensee's driver's license number or state identification card number if used for identification in applying for the license. A signed application for a concealed pistol license shall constitute a waiver of confidentiality and written request that the health care authority, mental health institutions, and other health care facilities release information relevant to the applicant's eligibility for a concealed pistol license to an inquiring court or law enforcement agency.

The application for an original license shall include a complete set of fingerprints to be forwarded to the Washington state patrol unless the applicant presents a valid permit to purchase firearms issued under section 2 of this act.

The license and application shall contain a warning substantially as follows:

CAUTION: Although state and local laws do not differ, federal law and state law on the possession of firearms differ. If you are prohibited by federal law from possessing a firearm, you may be prosecuted in federal court. A state license is not a defense to a federal prosecution.

The license shall contain a description of the major differences between state and federal law and an explanation of the fact that local laws and ordinances on firearms are preempted by state law and must be consistent with state law.

The application shall contain questions about the applicant's eligibility under RCW 9.41.040 and federal law to possess a pistol, the applicant's place of birth, and whether the applicant is a United States citizen. If the applicant is not a United States citizen, the applicant must provide the applicant's country of citizenship, United States issued alien number or admission number, and the basis on which the applicant claims to be exempt from federal prohibitions on firearm possession by aliens. The applicant shall not be required to produce a birth certificate or other evidence of citizenship.
