<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the use of algorithms for surveillance-based price discrimination and surge pricing threatens fair market access to grocery goods. The use of automation and dynamic pricing models in retail grocery sales exacerbates inequality and undermines consumer trust. The price of retail grocery goods should be rooted in fairness, not in profiling or prediction.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that comprehensive consumer protection is needed to prevent discriminatory and opaque pricing practices in retail grocery sales as businesses increasingly adopt data-driven technologies to set prices. Innovation should not come at the expense of transparency, fairness, or access to grocery goods.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that the prohibition of surveillance-based price discrimination and surge pricing will protect consumers from profiling and ensure equitable and fair pricing of grocery goods.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that a moratorium on the use of electronic shelf label systems by grocery businesses will protect consumers from data collection without their knowledge from their electronic devices, such as smartphones, to modify the price of grocery goods for individual shoppers. Pricing should remain consistent and be clearly posted.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to ban surveillance-based price discrimination and surge pricing and establish a four-year moratorium on the use of electronic shelf label systems in retail grocery locations to allow further study of the impact on pricing transparency and employee job security.</p>
