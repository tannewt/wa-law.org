1. In any civil action against a local government for personal injuries, or in any arbitration or mediation proceeding related to such civil action, evidence of the amount billed for medical, hospital, or similar expenses occasioned by an injury is not admissible to establish the plaintiff's damages, but the plaintiff's damages may be established by evidence of the amount actually paid for medical, hospital, or similar expenses occasioned by an injury.
