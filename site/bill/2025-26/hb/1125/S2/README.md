# HB 1125 - Sentence modification

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1125-S2.pdf)

## Section 1
This act shall be known and may be cited as the judicial discretion act.

## Section 2
1. The legislature finds that long-term incarceration disproportionately impacts low-income communities and communities of color. The legislature further finds that an expansive body of research demonstrates that persons who are granted early release before finishing lengthy sentences are less likely to recidivate. The legislature further finds that establishing an opportunity to modify a sentence encourages incarcerated individuals to engage in desirable behavior and to take advantage of rehabilitative programming. The legislature further finds that because the cost of long-term incarceration is substantial and the state must use its resources responsibly, providing judges the opportunity to modify lengthy sentences in the interests of justice will result in significant cost savings to the state.

2. Therefore, the legislature intends to authorize sentencing courts to review lengthy sentences upon a showing that a person's original sentence no longer serves the interests of justice.

## Section 3
1. Except as provided in subsections (13) and (14) of this section, and notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any person under a term of total confinement for a felony conviction may petition the sentencing court or the sentencing court's successor for a modification of sentence if the original sentence no longer serves the interests of justice and the person meets any of the following criteria:

If the court accepts the petition and determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the petitioner meets one or more of the criteria under subsection (1) of this section, the court shall grant a hearing to consider the petition, which must be heard within 120 days. The hearing may be continued for good cause upon motion by the petitioner or the prosecuting attorney.

4. [Empty]

    a. At the hearing to consider the petition, the petitioner is entitled to de novo review of the petitioner's original sentence. The court may grant the petition and modify the petitioner's original sentence if the court finds that the sentence no longer advances the interests of justice, provided that any new sentence imposed shall not be greater than the original sentence, and provided that any new sentence imposed shall be subject to the following:

        i. If the petitioner's original sentence is an indeterminate sentence imposed under RCW 9.94A.507, the court may modify the minimum term of the sentence but may not modify the maximum term of the sentence or order the petitioner's release from custody;

        ii. If the petitioner's original sentence includes a mandatory minimum term imposed pursuant to RCW 9.94A.540, the court may not modify the sentence below the mandatory minimum term required by law;

        iii. The soonest allowable release date from total confinement for any petitioner resentenced pursuant to this section may be no sooner than six months after the date of the hearing to consider the petition; and

        iv.

If the petitioner's original sentence includes at least five years of community custody, the court may not modify the amount of community custody.

    b. In addition to the mitigating factors provided under RCW 9.94A.535(1), the court may consider the following nonexhaustive list of factors when determining whether to modify the petitioner's sentence:

        i. The petitioner's disciplinary record and record of rehabilitation while incarcerated;

        ii. Evidence that reflects whether age, time served, and diminished physical condition, if any, have reduced the petitioner's risk for future recidivism;

        iii. Evidence regarding the petitioner's level of culpability for the offense;

        iv. Evidence that reflects changed circumstances since imposing the petitioner's original sentence such that the sentence no longer serves the interests of justice; and

    v. Demonstration of an extraordinary adverse impact of the petitioner's release on the victim or survivors of the victim of the crime for which the petitioner is presently incarcerated, with special consideration given to the impact of release on any victims of sex offenses or domestic violence offenses committed by the petitioner against an intimate partner.

5. When modifying a sentence pursuant to this section:

    a. The court may impose an exceptional sentence below the standard range based on evidence of significant rehabilitation since the offense or any other applicable factors; and

    b. If the petitioner's original sentence included one or more mandatory enhancements that were imposed under RCW 9.94A.533, the court may impose a sentence below the mandatory minimum enhancement term.

6. If the court denies a petition filed pursuant to this section and declines to set a hearing, or grants a hearing but declines to modify the petitioner's sentence at the hearing, the petitioner may, upon a showing of a change in circumstances, file a new petition no earlier than three years after the date the court denied the previous petition or declined to modify the petitioner's sentence, unless the court authorizes the petitioner to file a new petition at an earlier date. If the court denies the petition or declines to modify the petitioner's sentence, the court shall state the basis for its decision on the record and provide an explanation for its decision in a written order. The petitioner may appeal the denial of a hearing or an order entered pursuant to a resentencing hearing, provided, however, that denying a petition filed pursuant to this section shall not reopen the petitioner's conviction or sentence to any other challenges that would otherwise be barred.

7. [Empty]

    a. The prosecuting attorney shall make reasonable efforts to notify victims and survivors of victims of any hearing on a petition for modification of sentence filed pursuant to this section, including by providing the date of such hearing.

    b. For purposes of (a) of this subsection, the prosecuting attorney shall make reasonable efforts to notify victims and survivors of victims of any offense for which the petitioner is seeking a modification of sentence, and victims of any sex offense or domestic violence offense committed against an intimate partner victim for which the petitioner was previously convicted.

8. [Empty]

9. The court shall provide an opportunity for victims and survivors of victims of any crimes for which the petitioner has been convicted to present a statement personally or by representation at the hearing, and the court must take any such statements into consideration. Victims and survivors of victims are encouraged to articulate what outcome would make them feel safe as a part of any such statements presented to the court. The prosecuting attorney and the court shall comply with the requirements set forth in chapter 7.69 RCW.

10. The court shall not permit any person to waive the right to petition pursuant to this section. Any agreement to waive the right to petition pursuant to this section shall be void.

## Section 4
The time limit specified in RCW 10.73.090 does not apply to a petition or motion that is based solely on one or more of the following grounds:

1. Newly discovered evidence, if the defendant acted with reasonable diligence in discovering the evidence and filing the petition or motion;

2. The statute that the defendant was convicted of violating was unconstitutional on its face or as applied to the defendant's conduct;

6. A petition for a modification of sentence pursuant to section 3 of this act;

7. A motion for a modification of conditions of community custody pursuant to RCW 9.94A.703 and 9.94A.709; or

8. There has been a significant change in the law, whether substantive or procedural, which is material to the conviction, sentence, or other order entered in a criminal or civil proceeding instituted by the state or local government, and either the legislature has expressly provided that the change in the law is to be applied retroactively, or a court, in interpreting a change in the law that lacks express legislative intent regarding retroactive application, determines that sufficient reasons exist to require retroactive application of the changed legal standard.

## Section 5
The court may impose a sentence outside the standard sentence range for an offense if it finds, considering the purpose of this chapter, that there are substantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional sentence. Facts supporting aggravated sentences, other than the fact of a prior conviction, shall be determined pursuant to the provisions of RCW 9.94A.537.

Whenever a sentence outside the standard sentence range is imposed, the court shall set forth the reasons for its decision in written findings of fact and conclusions of law. A sentence outside the standard sentence range shall be a determinate sentence.

If the sentencing court finds that an exceptional sentence outside the standard sentence range should be imposed, the sentence is subject to review only as provided for in RCW 9.94A.585(4).

A departure from the standards in RCW 9.94A.589 (1) and (2) governing whether sentences are to be served consecutively or concurrently is an exceptional sentence subject to the limitations in this section, and may be appealed by the offender or the state as set forth in RCW 9.94A.585 (2) through (6).

1. Mitigating Circumstances - Court to Consider

The court may impose an exceptional sentence below the standard range if it finds that mitigating circumstances are established by a preponderance of the evidence. The following are illustrative only and are not intended to be exclusive reasons for exceptional sentences.

    a. To a significant degree, the victim was an initiator, willing participant, aggressor, or provoker of the incident.

    b. Before detection, the defendant compensated, or made a good faith effort to compensate, the victim of the criminal conduct for any damage or injury sustained.

    c. The defendant committed the crime under duress, coercion, threat, or compulsion insufficient to constitute a complete defense but which significantly affected his or her conduct.

    d. The defendant, with no apparent predisposition to do so, was induced by others to participate in the crime.

    e. The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his or her conduct, or to conform his or her conduct to the requirements of the law, was significantly impaired. Voluntary use of drugs or alcohol is excluded.

    f. The offense was principally accomplished by another person and the defendant manifested extreme caution or sincere concern for the safety or well-being of the victim.

    g. The operation of the multiple offense policy of RCW 9.94A.589 results in a presumptive sentence that is clearly excessive in light of the purpose of this chapter, as expressed in RCW 9.94A.010.

    h. The defendant or the defendant's children suffered a continuing pattern of physical or sexual abuse by the victim of the offense and the offense is a response to that abuse.

        i. The defendant was making a good faith effort to obtain or provide medical assistance for someone who is experiencing a drug-related overdose.

    j. The current offense involved domestic violence, as defined in RCW 10.99.020, and the defendant suffered a continuing pattern of coercion, control, or abuse by the victim of the offense and the offense is a response to that coercion, control, or abuse.

    k. The defendant was convicted of vehicular homicide, by the operation of a vehicle in a reckless manner and has committed no other previous serious traffic offenses as defined in RCW 9.94A.030, and the sentence is clearly excessive in light of the purpose of this chapter, as expressed in RCW 9.94A.010.

    l. The defendant petitions the court for modification of sentence pursuant to section 3 of this act, and the court considers the nonexhaustive list of additional factors provided under section 3(4)(b) of this act at a hearing on the petition.

2. Aggravating Circumstances - Considered and Imposed by the Court

The trial court may impose an aggravated exceptional sentence without a finding of fact by a jury under the following circumstances:

    a. The defendant and the state both stipulate that justice is best served by the imposition of an exceptional sentence outside the standard range, and the court finds the exceptional sentence to be consistent with and in furtherance of the interests of justice and the purposes of the sentencing reform act.

    b. The defendant's prior unscored misdemeanor or prior unscored foreign criminal history results in a presumptive sentence that is clearly too lenient in light of the purpose of this chapter, as expressed in RCW 9.94A.010.

    c. The defendant has committed multiple current offenses and the defendant's high offender score results in some of the current offenses going unpunished.

    d. The failure to consider the defendant's prior criminal history which was omitted from the offender score calculation pursuant to RCW 9.94A.525 results in a presumptive sentence that is clearly too lenient.

3. Aggravating Circumstances - Considered by a Jury - Imposed by the Court

Except for circumstances listed in subsection (2) of this section, the following circumstances are an exclusive list of factors that can support a sentence above the standard range. Such facts should be determined by procedures specified in RCW 9.94A.537.

    a. The defendant's conduct during the commission of the current offense manifested deliberate cruelty to the victim.
