<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington's system of public education is foundational to the state's economic vitality, civic health, and long-term prosperity. Over time, the legislature has enacted numerous policy requirements affecting public schools and school districts, many of which have imposed operational, administrative, and instructional obligations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that not all policy requirements have been accompanied by sufficient or sustainable funding, and that cumulative mandates, particularly those enacted without full fiscal consideration, divert resources away from core educational priorities and student learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature, therefore, intends to require independent, balanced, and objective reviews of the performance, operations, and funding of the state's K-12 public education system. The purpose of the reviews is to evaluate whether existing statutory requirements are achieving their intended outcomes, are improving student success, remain relevant and effective, and represent an efficient use of public resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also intends that the reviews required by this act inform future legislative decision making by identifying requirements that should be maintained, modified, consolidated, or eliminated, and by highlighting instances where obligations imposed on schools and school districts were enacted without appropriate or sufficient funding. These ongoing reviews are intended to support alignment between policy, performance, and funding in Washington's public education system.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
