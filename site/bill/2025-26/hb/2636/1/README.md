# HB 2636 - Public education reviews

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2636.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that Washington's system of public education is foundational to the state's economic vitality, civic health, and long-term prosperity. Over time, the legislature has enacted numerous policy requirements affecting public schools and school districts, many of which have imposed operational, administrative, and instructional obligations.

2. The legislature further finds that not all policy requirements have been accompanied by sufficient or sustainable funding, and that cumulative mandates, particularly those enacted without full fiscal consideration, divert resources away from core educational priorities and student learning.

3. The legislature, therefore, intends to establish an independent, balanced, and objective review of the performance, operations, and funding of the state's K-12 public education system. The purpose of the review is to evaluate whether existing statutory requirements are achieving their intended outcomes, remain relevant and effective, and represent an efficient use of public resources.

4. The legislature also intends that the review required by this act inform future legislative decision making by identifying requirements that should be maintained, modified, consolidated, or eliminated, and by highlighting instances where obligations imposed on schools and school districts were enacted without appropriate or sufficient funding. This ongoing review is intended to support alignment between policy, performance, and funding in Washington's public education system.

## Section 2
1. The public education performance, operations, and funding review commission is established.

2. The commission has 15 members as follows:

    a. The state auditor or the auditor's designee, who is a nonvoting member;

    b. A chair of the joint legislative audit and review committee or a chair's designee, who is a nonvoting member;

    c. The chairs of each of the two largest caucuses of the senate and the two largest caucuses of the house of representatives shall each appoint a member. None of these appointees may be members of the legislature;

    d. The superintendent of public instruction or the superintendent's designee;

    e. The chair of the state board of education or the chair's designee;

    f. The executive director of the Washington state charter school commission or the executive director's designee;

    g. One school principal, selected by an organization representing public school principals;

    h. One school director, selected by an organization representing public school directors;

        i. Two educators, one from a public primary school and one from a public secondary school, both selected by an organization representing educators;

    j. One representative selected by an organization representing public school business professionals; and

    k. One representative selected by an association representing public school administrators.

3. Persons appointed by the caucus chairs should be individuals who represent a balance of perspectives and constituencies and have an understanding of education policy, the funding of public schools, and the delivery of elementary and secondary education to public school students. These appointees should have knowledge and expertise in pedagogical practices, performance management, fiscal analysis, and other fields relevant to public education.

4. The commission shall elect a chair from among its voting or nonvoting members.

5. Members serve for terms of four years, with the terms expiring on June 30th on the fourth year of the term. However, in the case of the initial terms, the members appointed by the chairs of senate caucuses shall serve four-year terms, and the members appointed by the chairs of house of representatives caucuses shall serve three-year terms, with each of the terms expiring on June 30th of the applicable year. Appointees may be reappointed to serve more than one term.

6. The joint legislative audit and review committee shall provide staff support to the commission. The state board of education and the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall provide necessary support and information to the joint legislative audit and review committee.

7. The commission shall examine policy requirements and provided funding for public schools enacted by the Washington state legislature, prioritizing the review of requirements enacted and funding allocated in the 10 years preceding the issuance of each annual report required by subsection (9) of this section. The purpose of the examination is to evaluate whether the policy requirement or provided funding:

    a. Achieved the goal or outcome expressed or reasonably inferred by the applicable legislation;

    b. Has a positive cost-benefit result;

    c. Has ongoing relevance and education value; and

    d. Should be maintained, modified, or repealed.

8. The commission shall meet at least once a quarter and may hold additional meetings at the call of the chair or by a majority vote of the voting members of the commission. The members of the commission shall be compensated in accordance with RCW 43.03.220 and reimbursed for travel expenses in accordance with RCW 43.03.050 and 43.03.060.

9. Beginning November 1, 2030, and annually thereafter, the commission shall issue a report to the governor and the appropriate fiscal and policy committees. The report must include findings and recommendations for the requirements and funding examined by the commission in the preceding year.

## Section 3
This act takes effect July 1, 2029.
