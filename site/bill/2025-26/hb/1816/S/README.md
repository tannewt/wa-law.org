## Section 1
1. A political subdivision with more than 200,000 residents may establish and maintain a civilian-staffed crisis response team operating outside of a general authority Washington law enforcement agency to support the political subdivision's goal of providing a nonlaw enforcement response to individuals in crisis, in need of a safety and welfare check, or a request for resources, whenever such a response is appropriate.

2. The crisis response team is authorized to serve as a primary response to 911 calls when there is no report of active or imminent violence or possession of weapons and when the calls are regarding:

    a. A person in crisis with no request for law enforcement;

    b. A person who appears to need, or is reported to need, a safety and welfare check; or

    c. A request by a member of the public for resources including, but not limited to, shelter, food, or transportation.

3. For calls not included in subsection (2) of this section, the crisis response team may also serve as a secondary response in support of a law enforcement response as determined by the executive head of the political subdivision.

4. The crisis response team is authorized to initiate a field response when the team observes an event that meets the criteria in subsection (2) of this section.

        iii. The operators of mobile crisis teams administered by the behavioral health administrative services organization; or

        ii. The number of staff assigned to the crisis response team.

6. The alternative 911 response constituted in this section is deemed a third 911 first responder, parallel to law enforcement and fire response. The wages, hours, and other working conditions of all first responder personnel shall be subject to collective bargaining pursuant to chapter 41.56 RCW. The scope of responsibilities to be responded to by alternative 911 first response shall fall outside of a general authority Washington law enforcement agency and outside of a general authority Washington fire response.
