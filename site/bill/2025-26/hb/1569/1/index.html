<ol>
<li>
<p>Hundreds of tax exemptions and special tax preferences have been granted to special interests by the legislature without requiring assessment of whether those exemptions and preferences would create jobs or result in increased economic activity that increases state revenues. These exemptions and preferences result in the entire tax system being less fair for people who do not have special exemptions and preferences and increase the taxes on all other taxpayers in order to fund education and other state services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tax exemptions reduce revenues collected from the tax base and provide preferential treatment to some at the expense of those not getting a tax exemption. Almost as much money as is collected in tax revenues is not collected and is given out as tax exemptions. While every expenditure of revenue must be authorized and appropriated in the state budget approved by the legislature, the massive amounts of funding for these tax preferences and exemptions continue without any readoption by the legislature in each budget. These exemptions and preferences are, therefore, tax expenditures, most of which continue without any legislative action year after year while the state seeks other funding to meet constitutional duties to fund education and other services and obligations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Off-budget spending in the form of tax expenditures has resulted in out-of-control state spending that is depleting the state of needed revenue to fund essential state services like education and health care. Tax expenditures as off-budget spending lack the accountability of other state spending programs because they have not been included in the state biennial budget process and are not subject to the same biennial scrutiny.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This act creates a discretionary tax expenditure budget as part of the biennial budget adopted by the legislature. This act reforms the tax expenditure process by including a discretionary tax expenditure budget in the biennial state budget process. This act is intended to improve transparency and accountability by requiring that those tax preferences that have no expiration date in law or have been recommended for review and clarification: Receive a review, clarification, performance measures, and expiration date; are readopted every two years as part of the budget process; or expire. This brings tax expenditures into the state budget process to protect the public's interest, makes them more transparent and accountable, and helps ensure the tax expenditures are producing the results intended when they were adopted by the legislature. The legislature finds that it has not acted to review and clarify or terminate most tax preferences that the joint legislative audit and review committee have recommended for review and clarification or termination by the legislature. It is the legislature's intent to add weight to such findings and recommendations by recognizing that these are tax expenditures and requiring those discretionary preferences to be reviewed and clarified, terminated, or readopted in the biennial budget if they are to be continued.</p>

<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The omnibus operating appropriations act enacted by the legislature must include a discretionary tax expenditure budget detailing all discretionary tax expenditures. The four-year budget required to be balanced in RCW 43.88.055 may use revenues from expenditures that expire absent legislative readoption in the next biennial budget pursuant to section 5(2) of this act, and which are listed in the discretionary tax expenditure report prepared by the department of revenue pursuant to RCW 43.06.400, for the purposes of calculating available resources for the next ensuing fiscal biennium, provided that the omnibus operating appropriations act identifies the expiring discretionary tax expenditures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The discretionary tax expenditure budget must include an estimate of the state revenue impact associated with each discretionary tax expenditure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discretionary tax expenditures in the discretionary tax expenditure budget must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Be treated as any other state expenditure and must be reauthorized with each biennial budget, until such time as the expenditure otherwise expires;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have an expiration date of no greater than 10 years established in law or have been clarified if recommended for clarification by the joint legislative audit and review committee or the citizen commission for performance measurement of tax preferences review; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a revenue reduction of greater than $50,000 per fiscal year or $100,000 per biennium as estimated in the report prepared by the department of revenue pursuant to RCW 43.06.400.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature may expire a discretionary tax expenditure earlier than its authorized term by either:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A majority vote as provided under Article II, section 22 of the state Constitution; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As part of the budget process in the same manner as any other expenditure is approved or denied in the omnibus operating appropriations act by a majority vote of the members of the house of representatives and the senate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;discretionary tax expenditure&quot; means a tax preference, as defined in RCW 43.136.021, which:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Impacts revenues appropriated in the omnibus operating appropriations act;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has no expiration date established in law, or has been recommended by the joint legislative audit and review committee for review and clarification, but for which the legislature has not clarified and adopted new performance measures and an expiration date pursuant to RCW 82.32.805 and 82.32.808; and</p>

<p>Any discretionary tax expenditure that is required to be part of the submitted discretionary tax expenditure budget under section 5 of this act by reason of not having an expiration date established in law or not having been reviewed and clarified by the legislature following a recommendation to do so from the joint legislative audit and review committee or citizen commission for performance measurement of tax preferences, but which is not included in the discretionary tax expenditure budget in the adopted omnibus appropriations act, expires at the end of the calendar year in which the budget is adopted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any new discretionary tax expenditure is subject to the same audit and review procedures as existing discretionary tax expenditures are required to meet. New discretionary tax expenditures authorized as part of the discretionary tax expenditure budget in the omnibus operating appropriations act, but which were not reviewed under all provisions of RCW 43.136.045 or 43.136.055 before authorization in the omnibus operating appropriations act must be prioritized for review by the citizen commission for performance measurement of tax preferences and the joint legislative audit and review committee.</p>

<li>
<p>The citizen commission for performance measurement of tax preferences must develop a schedule to accomplish an orderly review of discretionary tax expenditures at least once every 10 years. In determining the schedule, the commission must consider the order the discretionary tax expenditures were enacted into law, in addition to other factors including but not limited to grouping preferences for review by type of industry, economic sector, or policy area. The commission must include, in a timely manner, in the schedule, a discretionary tax expenditure that has a statutory expiration date. The commission shall omit from the schedule discretionary tax expenditures that are required by constitutional law. As an alternative to the process under RCW 43.136.055, the commission, as well as the governor or the state legislature, may recommend to the joint legislative audit and review committee an expedited review process for any discretionary tax expenditure or group of expenditures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission must revise the schedule as needed each year, taking into account newly enacted or terminated discretionary tax expenditures. The commission must deliver the schedule to the joint legislative audit and review committee by September 1st of each year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission must provide a process for effective citizen input during its deliberations and must allow comments to be submitted and posted online.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purpose of this section, &quot;discretionary tax expenditure&quot; means a tax preference, as defined in RCW 43.136.021, which:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The joint legislative audit and review committee must review tax preferences according to the schedule developed under RCW 43.136.045. The committee must consider, but not be limited to, the following factors in the review as relevant to each particular tax preference:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The classes of individuals, types of organizations, or types of industries whose state tax liabilities are directly affected by the tax preference;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public policy objectives that might provide a justification for the tax preference, including but not limited to the legislative history, any legislative intent, or the extent to which the tax preference encourages business growth or relocation into this state, promotes growth or retention of high wage jobs, or helps stabilize communities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evidence that the existence of the tax preference has contributed to the achievement of any of the public policy objectives;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The extent to which continuation of the tax preference might contribute to any of the public policy objectives;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The extent to which the tax preference may provide unintended benefits to an individual, organization, or industry other than those the legislature intended;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The extent to which terminating the tax preference may have negative effects on the category of taxpayers that currently benefit from the tax preference, and the extent to which resulting higher taxes may have negative effects on employment and the economy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The feasibility of modifying the tax preference to provide for adjustment or recapture of the tax benefits of the tax preference if the objectives are not fulfilled;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fiscal impacts of the tax preference, including past impacts and expected future impacts if it is continued. For the purposes of this subsection, &quot;fiscal impact&quot; includes an analysis of the general effects of the tax preference on the overall state economy, including, but not limited to, the effects of the tax preference on the consumption and expenditures of persons and businesses within the state;</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>The extent to which termination of the tax preference would affect the distribution of liability for payment of state taxes;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The economic impact of the tax preference compared to the economic impact of government activities funded by the tax for which the tax preference is taken at the same level of expenditure as the tax preference. For purposes of this subsection the economic impact shall be determined using the Washington input-output model as published by the office of financial management;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amount of additional revenue generated in comparison to the reduction in revenue from the tax preference, if the tax preference includes a tax preference performance statement, stated legislative intent, or implied intent that seeks to generate additional revenue; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consideration of similar tax preferences adopted in other states, and potential public policy benefits that might be gained by incorporating corresponding provisions in Washington.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each tax preference, the committee must provide a recommendation as to whether the tax preference should be continued without modification, modified, scheduled for sunset review at a future date, or terminated immediately. The committee may recommend accountability standards for the future review of a tax preference.</p>
