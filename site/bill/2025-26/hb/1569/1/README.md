# HB 1569 - Tax exemptions

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1569.pdf)

## Section 1
1. Hundreds of tax exemptions and special tax preferences have been granted to special interests by the legislature without requiring assessment of whether those exemptions and preferences would create jobs or result in increased economic activity that increases state revenues. These exemptions and preferences result in the entire tax system being less fair for people who do not have special exemptions and preferences and increase the taxes on all other taxpayers in order to fund education and other state services.

2. Tax exemptions reduce revenues collected from the tax base and provide preferential treatment to some at the expense of those not getting a tax exemption. Almost as much money as is collected in tax revenues is not collected and is given out as tax exemptions. While every expenditure of revenue must be authorized and appropriated in the state budget approved by the legislature, the massive amounts of funding for these tax preferences and exemptions continue without any readoption by the legislature in each budget. These exemptions and preferences are, therefore, tax expenditures, most of which continue without any legislative action year after year while the state seeks other funding to meet constitutional duties to fund education and other services and obligations.

3. Off-budget spending in the form of tax expenditures has resulted in out-of-control state spending that is depleting the state of needed revenue to fund essential state services like education and health care. Tax expenditures as off-budget spending lack the accountability of other state spending programs because they have not been included in the state biennial budget process and are not subject to the same biennial scrutiny.

4. This act creates a discretionary tax expenditure budget as part of the biennial budget adopted by the legislature. This act reforms the tax expenditure process by including a discretionary tax expenditure budget in the biennial state budget process. This act is intended to improve transparency and accountability by requiring that those tax preferences that have no expiration date in law or have been recommended for review and clarification: Receive a review, clarification, performance measures, and expiration date; are readopted every two years as part of the budget process; or expire. This brings tax expenditures into the state budget process to protect the public's interest, makes them more transparent and accountable, and helps ensure the tax expenditures are producing the results intended when they were adopted by the legislature. The legislature finds that it has not acted to review and clarify or terminate most tax preferences that the joint legislative audit and review committee have recommended for review and clarification or termination by the legislature. It is the legislature's intent to add weight to such findings and recommendations by recognizing that these are tax expenditures and requiring those discretionary preferences to be reviewed and clarified, terminated, or readopted in the biennial budget if they are to be continued.

## Section 2
1. The omnibus operating appropriations act enacted by the legislature must include a discretionary tax expenditure budget detailing all discretionary tax expenditures. The four-year budget required to be balanced in RCW 43.88.055 may use revenues from expenditures that expire absent legislative readoption in the next biennial budget pursuant to section 5(2) of this act, and which are listed in the discretionary tax expenditure report prepared by the department of revenue pursuant to RCW 43.06.400, for the purposes of calculating available resources for the next ensuing fiscal biennium, provided that the omnibus operating appropriations act identifies the expiring discretionary tax expenditures.

2. The discretionary tax expenditure budget must include an estimate of the state revenue impact associated with each discretionary tax expenditure.

3. Discretionary tax expenditures in the discretionary tax expenditure budget must:

    a. Be treated as any other state expenditure and must be reauthorized with each biennial budget, until such time as the expenditure otherwise expires;

    b. Have an expiration date of no greater than 10 years established in law or have been clarified if recommended for clarification by the joint legislative audit and review committee or the citizen commission for performance measurement of tax preferences review; and

    c. Have a revenue reduction of greater than $50,000 per fiscal year or $100,000 per biennium as estimated in the report prepared by the department of revenue pursuant to RCW 43.06.400.

4. The legislature may expire a discretionary tax expenditure earlier than its authorized term by either:

    a. A majority vote as provided under Article II, section 22 of the state Constitution; or

    b. As part of the budget process in the same manner as any other expenditure is approved or denied in the omnibus operating appropriations act by a majority vote of the members of the house of representatives and the senate.

5. For the purposes of this section, "discretionary tax expenditure" means a tax preference, as defined in RCW 43.136.021, which:

    a. Impacts revenues appropriated in the omnibus operating appropriations act;

    b. Has no expiration date established in law, or has been recommended by the joint legislative audit and review committee for review and clarification, but for which the legislature has not clarified and adopted new performance measures and an expiration date pursuant to RCW 82.32.805 and 82.32.808; and

    c. Is not required by the state Constitution, United States Constitution, or federal law.

## Section 3
1. New or existing discretionary tax expenditures may not be approved or reauthorized by the legislature for 10 years after the effective date of this section.

2. Any discretionary tax expenditure that is required to be part of the submitted discretionary tax expenditure budget under section 5 of this act by reason of not having an expiration date established in law or not having been reviewed and clarified by the legislature following a recommendation to do so from the joint legislative audit and review committee or citizen commission for performance measurement of tax preferences, but which is not included in the discretionary tax expenditure budget in the adopted omnibus appropriations act, expires at the end of the calendar year in which the budget is adopted.

3. Any new discretionary tax expenditure is subject to the same audit and review procedures as existing discretionary tax expenditures are required to meet. New discretionary tax expenditures authorized as part of the discretionary tax expenditure budget in the omnibus operating appropriations act, but which were not reviewed under all provisions of RCW 43.136.045 or 43.136.055 before authorization in the omnibus operating appropriations act must be prioritized for review by the citizen commission for performance measurement of tax preferences and the joint legislative audit and review committee.

4. For the purpose of this section, "discretionary tax expenditure" means a tax preference, as defined in RCW 43.136.021, which:

    a. Impacts revenues appropriated in the omnibus operating appropriations act;

    b. Has no expiration date established in law, or has been recommended by the joint legislative audit and review committee for review and clarification, but for which the legislature has not clarified and adopted new performance measures and an expiration date pursuant to RCW 82.32.805 and 82.32.808; and

    c. Is not required by the state Constitution, United States Constitution, or federal law.

## Section 4
1. Beginning December 1, 2025, and December 1, 2026, and every second year thereafter, the department of revenue must submit to the legislature prior to the regular session a report with a listing of the amount of reduction for the current and next biennium in the revenues of the state or the revenues of local government collected by the state as a result of discretionary tax expenditures.

3.

The department of revenue must submit the discretionary tax expenditure report to the governor at the time biennial budget requests are due under RCW 43.88.030. The governor is requested to review the discretionary tax expenditure report from the department of revenue and submit it as part of the biennial budget documents under RCW 43.88.030.

2. For each tax preference, the committee must provide a recommendation as to whether the tax preference should be continued without modification, modified, scheduled for sunset review at a future date, or terminated immediately. The committee may recommend accountability standards for the future review of a tax preference.

To facilitate compliance with, and subject to the terms of, RCW 43.88.055 and 43.88.030, the state budget outlook work group shall prepare, subject to the approval of the economic and revenue forecast council under RCW 82.33.010, an official state budget outlook for state revenues and expenditures for the general fund and related funds. The revenue and caseload projections used in the outlook must reflect the most recent official forecasts adopted by the economic and revenue forecast council and the caseload forecast council for the years for which those forecasts are available.

2. The outlook must:

    a. Estimate revenues to and expenditures from the state general fund and related funds. The estimate of ensuing biennium expenditures must include maintenance items including, but not limited to, continuation of current programs, forecasted growth of current entitlement programs, and actions required by law, including legislation with a future implementation date. Estimates of ensuing biennium expenditures must exclude policy items including, but not limited to, legislation not yet enacted by the legislature, collective bargaining agreements not yet approved by the legislature, and changes to levels of funding for employee salaries and benefits unless those changes are required by statute. Estimated maintenance level expenditures must also exclude costs of court rulings issued during or within fewer than ninety days before the beginning of the current legislative session;

    b. Address major budget and revenue drivers, including trends and variability in these drivers;

    c. Clearly state the assumptions used in the estimates of baseline and projected expenditures and any adjustments made to those estimates;

    d. Clearly state the assumptions used in the baseline revenue estimates and any adjustments to those estimates; and

    e. Include the impact of previously enacted legislation with a future implementation date.

3. The outlook must also separately include projections based on the revenues and expenditures proposed in the governor's budget documents submitted to the legislature under RCW 43.88.030.

4. The economic and revenue forecast council shall submit state budget outlooks prepared under this section to the governor and the members of the committees on ways and means of the senate and house of representatives, including one copy to the staff of each of the committees, as required by this section.

5. Each January, the state budget outlook work group shall also prepare, subject to the approval of the economic and revenue forecast council, a state budget outlook for state revenues and expenditures that reflects the governor's proposed budget document submitted to the legislature under chapter 43.88 RCW. Within thirty days following enactment of an operating budget by the legislature, the work group shall prepare, subject to the approval of the economic and revenue forecast council, a state budget outlook for state revenues and expenditures that reflects the enacted budget.

6. All agencies of state government shall provide to the supervisor immediate access to all information relating to state budget outlooks.

7. The state budget outlook work group must publish its proposed methodology on the economic and revenue forecast council website. The state budget outlook work group, in consultation with the economic and revenue forecast work group and outside experts if necessary, must analyze the extent to which the proposed methodology for projecting expenditures for the ensuing fiscal biennia may be reliably used to determine the future impact of appropriations and make recommendations to change the outlook process to increase reliability and accuracy. The recommendations are due by December 1, 2013, and every five years thereafter.
