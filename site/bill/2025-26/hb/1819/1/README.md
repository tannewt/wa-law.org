[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1819.pdf)

## Section 1
Each electric utility must develop a plan consistent with this section.

1. Utilities with more than 25,000 customers that are not full requirements customers must develop or update an integrated resource plan by September 1, 2008. At a minimum, progress reports reflecting changing conditions and the progress of the integrated resource plan must be produced every two years thereafter. An updated integrated resource plan must be developed at least every four years subsequent to the 2008 integrated resource plan. The integrated resource plan, at a minimum, must include:

    a. A range of forecasts, for at least the next 10 years or longer, of projected customer demand which takes into account econometric data and customer usage;

    b. An assessment of commercially available conservation and efficiency resources, as informed, as applicable, by the assessment for conservation potential under RCW 19.285.040 for the planning horizon consistent with (a) of this subsection. Such assessment may include, as appropriate, opportunities for development of combined heat and power as an energy and capacity resource, demand response and load management programs, and currently employed and new policies and programs needed to obtain the conservation and efficiency resources;

    c. An assessment of commercially available, utility scale renewable and nonrenewable generating technologies including a comparison of the benefits and risks of purchasing power or building new resources;

    d. A comparative evaluation of renewable and nonrenewable generating resources, including transmission and distribution delivery costs, and conservation and efficiency resources using "lowest reasonable cost" as a criterion;

    e. An assessment of methods, commercially available technologies, or facilities for integrating renewable resources, including but not limited to battery storage and pumped storage, and addressing overgeneration events, if applicable to the utility's resource portfolio;

    f. An assessment and 20-year forecast of the availability of and requirements for regional generation and transmission capacity to provide and deliver electricity to the utility's customers and to meet the requirements of chapter 288, Laws of 2019 and the state's greenhouse gas emissions reduction limits in RCW 70A.45.020. The transmission assessment must identify the utility's expected needs to acquire new long-term firm rights, develop new, or expand or upgrade existing, bulk transmission facilities consistent with the requirements of this section and reliability standards;

        i. If an electric utility operates transmission assets rated at 115,000 volts or greater, the transmission assessment must take into account opportunities to make more effective use of existing transmission capacity through improved transmission system operating practices, energy efficiency, demand response, grid modernization, nonwires solutions, and other programs if applicable. The transmission assessment for such an electric utility must examine which of the utility's transmission lines can be reconductored with advanced conductors;

        ii. An electric utility that relies entirely or primarily on a contract for transmission service to provide necessary transmission services may comply with the transmission requirements of this subsection by requesting that the counterparty to the transmission service contract include the provisions of chapter 288, Laws of 2019 and chapter 70A.45 RCW as public policy mandates in the transmission service provider's process for assessing transmission need, and planning and acquiring necessary transmission capacity;

        iii. An electric utility may comply with the requirements of this subsection (1)(f) by relying on and incorporating the results of a separate transmission assessment process, conducted individually or jointly with other utilities and transmission system users, if that assessment process meets the requirements of this subsection;

    g. A determination of resource adequacy metrics for the resource plan consistent with the forecasts;

    h. A forecast of distributed energy resources that may be installed by the utility's customers and an assessment of their effect on the utility's load and operations;

        i. An identification of an appropriate resource adequacy requirement and measurement metric consistent with prudent utility practice in implementing RCW 19.405.030 through 19.405.050;

    j. The integration of the demand forecasts, resource evaluations, and resource adequacy requirement into a long‑range assessment describing the mix of supply side generating resources and conservation and efficiency resources that will meet current and projected needs, including mitigating overgeneration events and implementing RCW 19.405.030 through 19.405.050, at the lowest reasonable cost and risk to the utility and its customers, while maintaining and protecting the safety, reliable operation, and balancing of its electric system;

    k. An assessment, informed by the cumulative impact analysis conducted under RCW 19.405.140, of: Energy and nonenergy benefits and the avoidance and reductions of burdens to vulnerable populations and highly impacted communities; long-term and short-term public health and environmental benefits, costs, and risks; and energy security and risk;

    l. A 10-year clean energy action plan for implementing RCW 19.405.030 through 19.405.050 at the lowest reasonable cost, and at an acceptable resource adequacy standard, that identifies the specific actions to be taken by the utility consistent with the long‑range integrated resource plan; and

    m. An analysis of how the plan accounts for:

        i. Modeled load forecast scenarios that consider the anticipated levels of zero emissions vehicle use in a utility's service area, including anticipated levels of zero emissions vehicle use in the utility's service area provided in RCW 47.01.520, if feasible;

        ii. Analysis, research, findings, recommendations, actions, and any other relevant information found in the electrification of transportation plans submitted under RCW 35.92.450, 54.16.430, and 80.28.365; and

        iii. Assumed use case forecasts and the associated energy impacts. Electric utilities may, but are not required to, use the forecasts generated by the mapping and forecasting tool created in RCW 47.01.520. This subsection (1)(m)(iii) applies only to plans due to be filed after September 1, 2023.

2. The clean energy action plan must:

    a. Identify and be informed by the utility's 10-year cost-effective conservation potential assessment as determined under RCW 19.285.040, if applicable;

    b. Establish a resource adequacy requirement;

    c. Identify the potential cost-effective demand response and load management programs that may be acquired;

    d. Identify renewable resources, nonemitting electric generation, and distributed energy resources that may be acquired and evaluate how each identified resource may be expected to contribute to meeting the utility's resource adequacy requirement;

    e. Identify any need to develop new, or expand or upgrade existing, bulk transmission and distribution facilities and document existing and planned efforts by the utility to make more effective use of existing transmission capacity and secure additional transmission capacity consistent with the requirements of subsection (1)(f) of this section; and

    f. Identify the nature and possible extent to which the utility may need to rely on alternative compliance options under RCW 19.405.040(1)(b), if appropriate.

3. [Empty]

    a. An electric or large combination utility shall consider the social cost of greenhouse gas emissions, as determined by the commission for investor-owned utilities pursuant to RCW 80.28.405 and the department for consumer-owned utilities, when developing integrated resource plans and clean energy action plans. An electric utility must incorporate the social cost of greenhouse gas emissions as a cost adder when:

6. Assessments for demand-side resources included in an integrated resource plan may include combined heat and power systems as one of the measures in a conservation supply curve. The value of recoverable waste heat resulting from combined heat and power must be reflected in analyses of cost-effectiveness under this subsection.

7. An electric utility that is required to develop a resource plan under this section must complete its initial plan by September 1, 2008.

8. Plans developed under this section must be updated on a regular basis, on intervals approved by the commission or the department, or at a minimum on intervals of two years.

9. [Empty]

    a. Plans shall not be a basis to bring legal action against electric utilities. However, nothing in this subsection (9)(a) may be construed as limiting the commission or any party from bringing any action pursuant to Title 80 RCW, this chapter, or chapter 19.405 RCW against any large combination utility related to an integrated system plan submitted pursuant to RCW 80.86.020.

    b. The commission may approve, reject, or approve with conditions, any integrated system plans submitted by a large combination utility as defined in RCW 80.86.010.

10. [Empty]

    a. To maximize transparency, the commission, for investor-owned utilities, or the governing body, for consumer-owned utilities, may require an electric utility to make the utility's data input files available in a native format. Each electric utility shall publish its final plan either as part of an annual report or as a separate document available to the public. The report may be in an electronic form.

    b. Nothing in this subsection limits the protection of records containing commercial information under RCW 80.04.095.

11. The commission may require a large combination utility as defined in RCW 80.86.010 to incorporate the requirements of this section into an integrated system plan established under RCW 80.86.020.

## Section 2
1. In establishing rates for each electrical company regulated under this title, the commission may allow an incentive rate of return on investment through December 31, 2040, on capital expenditures for reconductoring transmission lines with advanced conductors for the benefit of ratepayers. The commission must consider and may adopt other policies to incentivize electrical companies to make investments that significantly increase the capacity of existing transmission infrastructure.

2. An incentive rate of return on investment under this section may be allowed only if the electrical company chooses to pursue capital investments in advanced conductor reconductoring. In the case of an incentive rate of return on investment allowed under this section, an increment of up to two percent may be added to the rate of return on common equity allowed on the company's other investments.

3. The incentive rate of return on investment authorized in subsection (2) of this section applies only to projects which have been installed after July 1, 2025.

4. The incentive rate of return on investment increment pursuant to this section may be earned only for a period up to the depreciable life of the investment as defined in the depreciation schedules approved by the commission for review.

5. By December 31, 2029, the commission must report to the appropriate committees of the legislature on the use of any incentives allowed under this section, the quantifiable impacts of the incentives on increasing the capacity of existing electric transmission infrastructure, and any recommendations to the legislature about further utility investments in existing electric transmission corridors.

## Section 3
The following utility-related actions are categorically exempt from compliance with this chapter:

1. Upgrading or rebuilding an existing transmission line by reconductoring the line with advanced conductors within existing rights-of-way;

2. Widening existing rights-of-way to meet electrical standards if the widening remains within previously disturbed or developed lands and only extends into an area beyond such rights-of-way as needed to comply with applicable electrical standards.

## Section 4
This act may be known and cited as the Washington incentives for reconductoring in existing developed transmission corridors act.
