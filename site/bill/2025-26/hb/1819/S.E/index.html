<p>The following utility-related actions are categorically exempt from compliance with this chapter: Upgrading or rebuilding existing electric powerlines within an existing powerline right-of-way, including:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Relocations of small segments of the powerlines within an existing powerline right-of-way or within previously disturbed or developed lands; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Widening an existing powerline right-of-way to meet current electrical standards if the widening remains within previously disturbed or developed lands and only extends into a small area beyond such lands as needed to comply with applicable electrical standards.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The categorical exemption required in subsection (1) of this section shall not apply if any of the following conditions are present:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The proposed action is a series of actions, physically or functionally related to each other, some of which are categorically exempt and some of which are not;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proposed action is a series of exempt actions that are physically or functionally related to each other, and that together may have a probable significant adverse environmental impact in the judgment of an agency with jurisdiction. If so, that agency shall be the lead agency, unless the agencies with jurisdiction agree that another agency should be the lead agency. For proposals in this subsection, the agency or applicant may proceed with the exempt aspects of the proposals, prior to conducting environmental review; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proposed action includes installation or construction directly in or under lands covered by water.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Previously disturbed or developed&quot; refers to land that has been changed such that its functioning ecological processes have been and remain altered by human activity. The phrase encompasses areas that have been transformed from natural cover to nonnative species or a managed state including, but not limited to, utility and electric power transmission corridors and rights-of-way, and other areas where active utilities and currently used roads are readily available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Upgrading or rebuilding existing electric powerlines&quot; includes any repair, maintenance, replacement, modification, or upgrade including, but not limited to, increases in voltage, reconductoring, installation of grid-enhancing or optimizing technologies, or the relocation or addition of utility poles, to any existing electric transmission or distribution electric powerlines and any associated infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>For a project that is categorically exempt under section 1 of this act, the utility must notify the department of archaeology and historic preservation created in chapter 43.334 RCW and each federally recognized Indian tribe with usual and accustomed areas and ceded treaty areas in the area where the right-of-way exists before commencing the project. The purpose of the notification and consultation required under this section is to allow the utility to determine that there are no existing archaeological, cultural, or tribal resources in the right-of-way. The department of archaeology and historic preservation may require a survey to be done in coordination with the affected federally recognized Indian tribe, must ensure that consultation with such tribe occurs, and must determine whether archaeological, cultural, or tribal resources are identified in an existing right-of-way. If any such resources are identified, the department of archaeology and historic preservation must ensure that the utility accounts for and protects the resources under chapter 27.53 RCW. Information provided by the federally recognized Indian tribe must be kept confidential and exempt from public disclosure under chapter 42.56 RCW.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>An assessment, informed by the cumulative impact analysis conducted under RCW 19.405.140, of: Energy and nonenergy benefits and the avoidance and reductions of burdens to vulnerable populations and highly impacted communities; long-term and short-term public health and environmental benefits, costs, and risks; and energy security and risk;</p>
