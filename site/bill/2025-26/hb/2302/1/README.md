# HB 2302 - Pharmacist prescriptive auth

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2302.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature is deeply concerned about Washington's provider shortage, particularly in rural and underserved communities. Pharmacists are highly trained health care professionals who are uniquely qualified to prescribe medications and devices that improve patient access and outcomes. They practice across many health care settings and routinely prescribe and manage therapies for chronic conditions, including behavioral health, addiction, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders.

2. The legislature recognizes that pharmacists earn a doctor of pharmacy degree, the required standard since 2000, which includes extensive education focused on medications and the conditions they treat with a minimum of 1,740 hours of direct patient care in both community and inpatient settings. Despite over 25 years of advanced training, the scope of practice for pharmacists in Washington has remained unchanged. Health care relies upon medications that have grown in complexity and quantity. Pharmacists are highly trained health care providers that are underutilized. Pharmacists have extensive training to ensure that complex and expensive medications are optimally used to improve outcomes.

3. The legislature affirms that pharmacists in Washington have been prescribing and diagnosing under collaborative drug therapy agreements since 1979. The 2020 opinion of the Washington state attorney general confirmed that pharmacists may diagnose pursuant to these protocols. The Washington state pharmacy quality assurance commission has no record of patient harm related to pharmacists prescribing or diagnosing under collaborative drug therapy agreements, and the legislature finds that pharmacists provide safe, accessible care.

4. However, the legislature finds that maintaining and filing the collaborative drug therapy agreements have become an administrative burden that does not improve oversight or patient care. To expand access and fully leverage pharmacists' expertise, it is the intent of the legislature to improve outcomes in both behavioral and physical health by authorizing pharmacists to practice to the full extent of their education, training, and experience.
