[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1409-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The department shall adopt rules that establish standards that reduce carbon intensity in transportation fuels used in Washington. The standards established by the rules must be based on the carbon intensity of gasoline and gasoline substitutes and the carbon intensity of diesel and diesel substitutes. The standards:

    a. Must reduce the overall, aggregate carbon intensity of transportation fuels used in Washington;

    b. May only require carbon intensity reductions at the aggregate level of all transportation fuels and may not require a reduction in carbon intensity to be achieved by any individual type of transportation fuel;

    c. Must assign a compliance obligation to fuels whose carbon intensity exceeds the standards adopted by the department, consistent with the requirements of RCW 70A.535.030; and

    d. Must assign credits that can be used to satisfy or offset compliance obligations to fuels whose carbon intensity is below the standards adopted by the department and that elect to participate in the program, consistent with the requirements of RCW 70A.535.030.

2. The clean fuels program adopted by the department must be designed such that:

    a. Regulated parties generate deficits and may reconcile the deficits, and thus comply with the clean fuels program standards for a compliance period, by obtaining and retiring credits;

    b. Regulated parties and credit generators may generate credits for fuels used as substitutes or alternatives for gasoline or diesel;

    c. Regulated parties, credit generators, and credit aggregators shall have opportunities to trade credits; and

    d. Regulated parties shall be allowed to carry over to the next compliance period a small deficit without penalty.

3. The department shall, throughout a compliance period, regularly monitor the availability of fuels needed for compliance with the clean fuels program.

4. [Empty]

    a. Under the clean fuels program, the department shall monthly calculate the volume-weighted average price of credits and, no later than the last day of the month immediately following the month for which the calculation is completed, post the formula and the nonaggregated data the department used for the calculation and the results of the calculation on the department's website.

    b. In completing the calculation required by this subsection, the department may exclude from the data set credit transfers without a price or other credit transfers made for a price that falls two standard deviations outside of the mean credit price for the month. Data posted on the department's website under this section may not include any individually identifiable information or information that would constitute a trade secret.

5.The rules adopted under this section must reduce the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to each unit of the fuels to 55 percent below 2017 levels by no earlier than January 1, 2038, based on the following schedule:

    a. No more than 0.5 percent each year in 2023 and 2024;

    b. No more than an additional one percent each year beginning in 2025

and on January 1, 2026;

    c. No more than an additional eight percent beginning on January 1, 2027; and

    d. No more than an additional four percent each year beginning January 1, 2028, through January 1, 2038.

6. Transportation fuels exported from Washington are not subject to the greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirements in this section.

7. To the extent the requirements of this chapter conflict with the requirements of chapter 19.112 RCW, the requirements of this chapter prevail.
