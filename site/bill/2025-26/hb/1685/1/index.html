<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature intends to create a more accountable, transparent, and effective department of fish and wildlife by consolidating the executive and administrative power of the department into the hands of a director appointed by the governor with the consent of the senate. This structure will facilitate improved government-to-government communication with the tribes and allow for increased collaboration with other state agencies, while retaining the value of the fish and wildlife commission as an advisory body that will provide transparency and an avenue for public input and participation.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>The director shall be the executive and administrative head of the department. The governor shall appoint the director with the consent of the senate. The director has complete charge of and supervisory powers over the department. The director will be paid a salary fixed by the governor in accordance with RCW 43.03.040. If a vacancy occurs in the position of director while the senate is not in session, the governor shall make a temporary appointment until the next meeting of the senate, at which time he or she shall present to that body his or her nomination for the position. The director may appoint and employ necessary personnel. The director may delegate, in writing, to department personnel the duties and powers necessary for efficient operation and administration of the department.</p>
