<li>
<p>The legislature finds that economic stability is foundational to the health and well-being of Washingtonians and recognizes the 10-year plan to dismantle poverty as the guiding state strategic plan to measurably reduce poverty and increase well-being in our state. As poverty reduction can only be achieved through coordinated action and systemic change, the legislature finds that an intentional alignment of efforts across state agencies, stakeholders, community members, and the legislature is needed to fully realize that outcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to ensure the alignment described in subsection (1) of this section, the legislature finds it necessary to update the name, duties, membership, and structure of the legislative-executive WorkFirst poverty reduction oversight task force in order to align with the Washington economic justice alliance and ensure continued momentum in the work to dismantle poverty and injustice in Washington state.</p>
