<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The goals of co-response are to de-escalate situations, divert people from criminal justice and emergency medical systems, and bring medical and behavioral health care into the field to serve vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>Co-responders play a critical role in Washington's emergency response landscape, promoting a crisis care delivery system that appropriately responds to behavioral health emergencies and adapts to complex needs at the nexus of health and behavioral health. As Washington's crisis care delivery system continues to evolve, co-responders should be integrated into new and existing programs and legal frameworks in a way that consistently reflects their contributions to the health and well-being of the people of Washington and provides the necessary support for them to continue their critical work.</p>
