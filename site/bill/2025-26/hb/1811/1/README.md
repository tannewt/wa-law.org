# HB 1811 - Crisis co-response

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1811.pdf)

## Section 1
The goals of co-response are to de-escalate situations, divert people from criminal justice and emergency medical systems, and bring medical and behavioral health care into the field to serve vulnerable populations.

Co-responders play a critical role in Washington's emergency response landscape, promoting a crisis care delivery system that appropriately responds to behavioral health emergencies and adapts to complex needs at the nexus of health and behavioral health. As Washington's crisis care delivery system continues to evolve, co-responders should be integrated into new and existing programs and legal frameworks in a way that consistently reflects their contributions to the health and well-being of the people of Washington and provides the necessary support for them to continue their critical work.

## Section 2
The University of Washington school of social work, in consultation with the authority, shall collaborate with a statewide organization focused on co-response outreach to develop a statewide internal peer support program designed to assist co-response professionals who have faced life-threatening or traumatic incidents that occur while on the job.

## Section 3
Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter.

## Section 4

But this exception shall not apply to a civil action or proceeding by one against the other, nor to a criminal action or proceeding for a crime committed by one against the other, nor to a criminal action or proceeding against a spouse or domestic partner if the marriage or the domestic partnership occurred subsequent to the filing of formal charges against the defendant, nor to a criminal action or proceeding for a crime committed by said spouse or domestic partner against any child of whom said spouse or domestic partner is the parent or guardian, nor to a proceeding under chapter 71.05 or 71.09 RCW: PROVIDED, That the spouse or the domestic partner of a person sought to be detained under chapter 71.05 or 71.09 RCW may not be compelled to testify and shall be so informed by the court prior to being called as a witness.
