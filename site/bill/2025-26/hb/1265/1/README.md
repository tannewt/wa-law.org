# HB 1265 - Commercial sexual exploit.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1265.pdf)

## Section 1
Commercial sexual exploitation targets the most vulnerable: Women, children, and young adults, primarily in communities of poverty; indigenous communities; communities of color; foster care; and those who identify as LGBTQ+. Many exploited adults were first exploited as children. Addressing both the causes and the impacts of exploitation requires a comprehensive two-pronged approach:

1. A public health system that holistically supports victims and survivors with well-resourced transition services, housing, and community-based trauma recovery services.

2. Suppression and deterrence of the demand from buyers, who are the source of both most of the violence against the exploited individuals, and the enormous profits being paid to third-party exploiters.

The legislature intends to enhance the legal interventions available to law enforcement, courts, and the community to hold buyers accountable for their role in commercial sexual exploitation while increasing resources and support for survivors.

## Section 2
1. A person is guilty of commercial sexual exploitation if:

    a. Pursuant to a prior understanding, he or she pays a fee or provides anything of value to another person as compensation for such person or a third person having engaged in sexual conduct with him or her; or

    b. He or she pays or agrees to pay a fee or provide anything of value to another person pursuant to an understanding that in return therefor such person will engage in sexual conduct with him or her; or

    c. He or she solicits or requests another person to engage in sexual conduct with him or her in return for a fee or providing anything of value.

2. The crime of commercial sexual exploitation may be committed in more than one location. The crime is deemed to have been committed in any location in which the defendant commits any act under subsection (1)(a), (b), or (c) of this section that constitutes part of the crime. A person who sends a communication to engage or solicit another in commercial sexual conduct is considered to have committed the crime both at the place from which the contact was made pursuant to subsection (1)(a), (b), or (c) of this section and where the communication is received, provided that this section must be construed to prohibit anyone from being prosecuted twice for substantially the same crime.

3. For purposes of this section, "sexual conduct" has the meaning given in RCW 9A.88.030.

4. Commercial sexual exploitation is a class C felony.
