<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that providing additional services at the local level to get ahead of challenges that many individuals face, particularly children, in order to thrive is important for the success of the citizens of Washington.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that there are many services that are not addressed through current funding options, including medicaid and county behavioral health programs. Existing service gaps include crisis stabilization, children mental health therapies, prevention and early interventions, behavioral health modalities, and culturally appropriate models for smaller community-based organizations. Reaching children and their families early is one of the best ways to reduce long-term needs and make a difference in overall mental health status as well as reducing youth violence, drug use, and suicides.</p>
