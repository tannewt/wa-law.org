# HB 2644 - Law enf. body worn cameras

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2644.pdf)

## Section 1
This act may be known and cited as the law enforcement body worn camera act.

## Section 2
The legislature finds that public trust in law enforcement is strengthened by transparency and accountability, and that body worn cameras provide an objective record of law enforcement interactions, protect both officers and the public, and aid in accurate investigations and judicial proceedings.

Therefore, the legislature intends to establish a uniform statewide standard requiring all law enforcement officers to activate their body worn cameras during all law enforcement encounters and responses to incidents, ensuring continuous and reliable recordings of public interactions.

## Section 3
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Body worn camera" means a video and sound recording device attached to the uniform or eyewear of a law enforcement officer that records the officer's interactions and activities while in the course of the officer's official duties.

2. "Incident" means any situation where a law enforcement officer is dispatched, responds, or becomes involved, including but not limited to enforcement actions, investigations, traffic stops, calls for service, detentions, and arrests.

3. "Law enforcement agency" means a general authority Washington law enforcement agency as defined in RCW 10.93.020.

4. "Law enforcement officer" means a general authority Washington peace officer as defined in RCW 10.93.020.

2. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the body worn camera must remain activated until the incident or interaction has fully concluded, including by remaining activated throughout any transportation of detainees or suspects.

3. [Empty]

    a. Deactivating the body worn camera is authorized only under the following circumstances:

        i. Interactions involving a confidential informant or undercover officer where recording the interaction may reveal the informant or officer's identity; or

        ii. During personal breaks, administrative discussions, or when the law enforcement officer is not engaged in law enforcement activity.

    b. If the body worn camera is deactivated for any reason under (a) of this subsection, the law enforcement officer must verbally record the justification prior to deactivation, and reactivate the body worn camera immediately upon reengagement in any law enforcement activity.

## Section 5
1. Beginning July 1, 2027, each law enforcement agency in the state must store the body worn camera recordings of the agency's officers using secure digital evidence systems compliant with all applicable data security standards under state law.

1. When a body worn camera must be activated and deactivated, and when a law enforcement officer has the discretion to activate and deactivate the body worn camera;

2. How a law enforcement officer is to respond to circumstances when it would be reasonably anticipated that a person may be unwilling or less willing to communicate with an officer who is recording the communication with a body worn camera;

3. How a law enforcement officer will document when and why a body worn camera was deactivated prior to the conclusion of an interaction with a member of the public while conducting official law enforcement duties;

Any ordinance or resolution authorizing the use of body worn cameras should identify a community involvement process for providing input into the development of operational policies governing the use of body worn cameras.
