<p>If a vehicle is in violation of the time restrictions of RCW 46.55.010(14), it may be impounded by a registered tow truck operator at the direction of a law enforcement officer, authorized regional transit authority representative under the conditions described in RCW 46.55.010(14)(a)(iv), authorized city representative under the conditions described in RCW 46.55.010(14)(a)(v), or other public official with jurisdiction if the vehicle is on public property, or at the direction of the property owner or an agent if it is on private property.

<li>
<p>The person requesting a private impound or a law enforcement officer, authorized regional transit authority representative, authorized city representative, or public official requesting a public impound shall provide a signed authorization for the impound at the time and place of the impound to the registered tow truck operator before the operator may proceed with the impound. A registered tow truck operator, employee, or his or her agent may not serve as an agent of a property owner for the purposes of signing an impound authorization or, independent of the property owner, identify a vehicle for impound.</p>

<p>In the case of a private impound, the impound authorization shall include the following statement: &quot;A person authorizing this impound, if the impound is found in violation of chapter 46.55 RCW, may be held liable for the costs incurred by the vehicle owner.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A registered tow truck operator shall record and keep in the operator's files the date and time that a vehicle is put in the operator's custody and released. The operator shall make an entry into a master log regarding transactions relating to impounded vehicles. The operator shall make this master log available, upon request, to representatives of the department or the state patrol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person who engages in or offers to engage in the activities of a registered tow truck operator may not be associated in any way with a person or business whose main activity is authorizing the impounding of vehicles.</p>
</li>
