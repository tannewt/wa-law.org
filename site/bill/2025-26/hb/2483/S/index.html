<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that consumers are increasingly conducting their professional and personal affairs online and on devices such as laptop computers, smartphones, or tablets. These activities include accessing the marketplace, the workplace, health care, information, and entertainment. Through these daily activities, consumers generate enormous and unprecedented amounts of data about themselves, including their locations, behaviors, and preferences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further recognizes that technological advances have made it possible to more easily and quickly collect vast amounts of personal information and connect it to an individual, whether such information is obtained through electronic or other means.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that there are many businesses engaged in collecting the personal data of Washingtonians, and sharing, buying, and selling it without Washingtonians' knowledge or consent. This is a new business model that has flourished and is anticipated to grow as more people and more devices are connected with ever-increasing frequency for an ever-greater number of innovative applications. As such, the legislature intends to provide transparency into the number of businesses, volume, and type of activity in this unique and growing industry.</p>
