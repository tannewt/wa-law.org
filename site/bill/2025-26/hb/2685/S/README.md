## Section 1
1. State agencies listed in RCW 43.71B.020(1)(b)(i) shall use and share tribal data in a manner consistent with the following tribal data sovereignty principles:

    a.

    b. Tribes must possess the sovereign authority to manage the collection, ownership, application, and interpretation of their own data even when it is collected by federal, state, or local governments or other third parties;

    c. Tribes must retain an ownership interest in their data even when the tribe's data is located in state, federal, or other data sets. This interest remains when the tribe's data is aggregated with other data;

    d. Unless otherwise required by law, tribes have the right to informed consent on how their data, including protected health information about tribal members, is used or shared with third parties; and
