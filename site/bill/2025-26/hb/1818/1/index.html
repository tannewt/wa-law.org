<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the statutes in chapter 58.17 RCW governing the subdivision of land were originally enacted in 1969. The subdivision process as originally enacted has evolved in implementation by local jurisdiction over 50 years such that a preliminary plat has the level of detail of what was previously considered for a final plat. The subdivision statutes have not been comprehensively updated since the adoption of the growth management act, the statutes governing local project review in chapter 36.70B RCW, and the statutes integrating project review under the state environmental policy act and the growth management act. The submittal requirements for a short plat have evolved to become essentially the same as required for a subdivision making the distinction between a short plat and a subdivision obsolete. This act intends to update the statutes governing the division of land to provide a uniform process.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the process by which land is divided is a matter of state concern and should be administered in a uniform manner by cities, towns, and counties throughout the state. The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the division of land, alteration of property boundaries, and to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare in accordance with standards established by the state  to lessen congestion in the streets and highways; to promote efficient use of land;  to provide for adequate light and air; to facilitate adequate provision for water, sewerage, parks and recreation areas, sites for schools and schoolgrounds, and other public requirements; to provide for proper ingress and egress; to provide for the expeditious review and approval of proposed subdivisions which conform to local comprehensive plans, zoning, and development regulations; to adequately provide for the housing and commercial needs of the people of the state; and to require a uniform process for the division of land, and conveyances with accurate legal descriptions.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A city, town, or county may adopt by ordinance procedures for the divisions of land into lots, tracts, or parcels through approval and recording of a binding site plan as an alternate method to the subdivision procedures in this chapter only for the following purposes:</p>
<ol type="a">

<p>A binding site plan ordinance under this section may apply the same or different requirements and procedures to each of the three types of authorized divisions.

</li>
<li>
<p>The binding site plan, after approval or when specific lots are administratively approved, must be filed with the county auditor together with a record or survey. Lots, tracts, blocks, or other divisions created through the binding site plan procedure must be legal lots of record upon recording of the binding site plan. The number of lots or tracts may not exceed the number of lots allowed by the local zoning ordinances and development regulations. All development and use of the land described herein must be in accordance with this binding site plan, as it may be amended with the approval of the city, town, or county having jurisdiction of the development of the land, and in accordance with permits, approvals, regulations, requirements, and restrictions that may be imposed upon the land and the development and use thereof.</p>

If the subdivision is subject to restrictive covenants which were recorded and applicable to the recorded final plat of the subdivision, and the application for vacation would result in the violation of a covenant contained within such restrictive covenants, the application shall include an agreement signed by all parties subject to the covenants providing that the parties agree to terminate or alter the relevant covenants to accomplish the purpose of the vacation of the subdivision or portion thereof.</p>

In addition, if the subdivision,  lot, tract, parcel, or site lies within land within the district classified as irrigable, completed irrigation water distribution facilities for such land may be required by the irrigation district by resolution, bylaw, or rule of general applicability as a condition for approval of the  final plat by the authorized official of the city, town, or county. Rights-of-way shall be evidenced by the respective plats submitted for final approval to the appropriate authorized official. In addition, if the subdivision,  lot, tract, parcel, or site to be platted is wholly or partially within an irrigation district of 200,000 acres or more and has been previously platted by the United States bureau of reclamation as a farm unit in the district, the  plat or final plat as defined in RCW 58.17.020 may not be approved by the city, town, or county without the approval of the irrigation district and the administrator or manager of the project of the bureau of reclamation, or its successor agency, within which that district lies.

<p>A proposed lot split may be conditioned upon dedication of right-of-way on the donor lot to the extent such dedication would otherwise be required under applicable codes, regulations, and design standards for the development or subdivision of the donor lot absent an administrative lot split. Similarly, a subsequent application for development of housing units on the newly created lot may be conditioned upon construction of frontage improvements to right-of-way adjacent to either the donor parcel or the newly created lots to the extent such improvements would be required under applicable codes, regulations, and design standards.
