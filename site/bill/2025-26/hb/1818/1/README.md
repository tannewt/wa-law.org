# HB 1818 - Administration of plats

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1818.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that the statutes in chapter 58.17 RCW governing the subdivision of land were originally enacted in 1969. The subdivision process as originally enacted has evolved in implementation by local jurisdiction over 50 years such that a preliminary plat has the level of detail of what was previously considered for a final plat. The subdivision statutes have not been comprehensively updated since the adoption of the growth management act, the statutes governing local project review in chapter 36.70B RCW, and the statutes integrating project review under the state environmental policy act and the growth management act. The submittal requirements for a short plat have evolved to become essentially the same as required for a subdivision making the distinction between a short plat and a subdivision obsolete. This act intends to update the statutes governing the division of land to provide a uniform process.

## Section 2
The legislature finds that the process by which land is divided is a matter of state concern and should be administered in a uniform manner by cities, towns, and counties throughout the state. The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the division of land, alteration of property boundaries, and to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare in accordance with standards established by the state  to lessen congestion in the streets and highways; to promote efficient use of land;  to provide for adequate light and air; to facilitate adequate provision for water, sewerage, parks and recreation areas, sites for schools and schoolgrounds, and other public requirements; to provide for proper ingress and egress; to provide for the expeditious review and approval of proposed subdivisions which conform to local comprehensive plans, zoning, and development regulations; to adequately provide for the housing and commercial needs of the people of the state; and to require a uniform process for the division of land, and conveyances with accurate legal descriptions.

## Section 3

4. The requirements for a fully completed application shall be defined by local ordinance consistent with the requirements of chapter 36.70B RCW. A city, town, or county may not prohibit the submittal of a complete application based on a requirement not expressed in state law or local ordinance. This subsection does not operate to allow for or require any public meeting or other form of community engagement as a prerequisite to submittal of a complete application.

4. A binding site plan submitted pursuant to RCW 58.17.040(7) is deemed to have been approved if the site plan was approved by a city, town, or county: (a) In connection with the approval of a final plan with respect to all of such land; (b) in connection with the issuance of building permits or final certificates of occupancy with respect to all such land; or (c) if not approved pursuant to (a) or (b) of this subsection, then pursuant to such other procedures as the city, town, or county with jurisdiction may have established for the approval of a binding site plan.

5. All provisions, conditions, and requirements of the binding site plan shall be legally enforceable on the purchaser or any other person acquiring a lease or other ownership interest of any lot or tract created pursuant to the binding site plan.

6. It is a violation of this chapter, and may be restrained by injunctive action and found illegal as provided in this chapter, to sell, transfer, or lease any lot or tract that is on a binding site plan that has not been approved and recorded or does not conform to the requirements of the binding site plan.

8. A city, town, or county shall complete its review and render a final decision on a plat application for proposed subdivisions consistent with the applicable time periods adopted by the city, town, or county pursuant to chapter 36.70B RCW.

A final plat or a plat, if its application was submitted and deemed complete after July 1, 2026, meeting all requirements of this chapter shall be submitted to the authorized official of the city, town, or county for approval within five years of the date of preliminary plat approval for any plat application that is deemed complete on or before June 30, 2026, and for any plat application submitted on or after July 1, 2026; provided, if an administrative or judicial appeal is filed regarding approval of a preliminary plat or a plat, then the date of approval for commencement of the five-year period may not commence until such appeal is completed and final.

5. Nothing contained in this section shall act to prevent any city, town, or county from adopting by ordinance procedures that would allow for the extensions of the time periods in this section in which to submit a final plat for approval. Extensions may contain additional or amended conditions and requirements than what was required for the approval of the plat deemed necessary to comply with applicable development regulations, codes, and design standards.

## Section 17
Each approved preliminary plat for which an application was deemed to be complete on or before June 30, 2026, and each plat application with a date of completeness on or after July 1, 2026, that is submitted for final plat approval of the authorized official shall be accompanied by  recommendations for approval or disapproval from the following:

## Section 26
A city, town, or county may not issue any building permit, septic tank permit, or other development permit, or approval for any lot, tract, or parcel of land divided in violation of this chapter or local regulations adopted pursuant thereto, unless the authority authorized to issue such permit or approval finds that the public interest will not be adversely affected thereby. The prohibition contained in this section shall not apply to an innocent purchaser for value without actual notice of the violation of this chapter or local regulations. All purchasers' or transferees' property, other than property of an innocent purchaser for value, shall comply with provisions of this chapter and each purchaser or transferee may recover his or her damages from any person, firm, corporation, or agent selling or transferring land in violation of this chapter or local regulations adopted pursuant thereto, including any amount reasonably spent as a result of inability to obtain any development permit or approval and spent to conform to the requirements of this chapter as well as cost of investigation, suit, and reasonable attorneys' fees occasioned thereby. Such purchaser or transferee may as an alternative to conforming his or her property to these requirements, rescind the sale or transfer and recover costs of investigation, suit, and reasonable attorneys' fees occasioned thereby.

## Section 27
Whenever any person is interested in the vacation of any recorded final plat for a subdivision or portion thereof, or any area designated or dedicated for public use, that person shall file an application for vacation with  the city, town, or county in which the subdivision is located. The application shall set forth the reasons for vacation and shall contain signatures of all parties having an ownership interest in that portion of the subdivision subject to vacation. If the subdivision is subject to restrictive covenants which were recorded and applicable to the recorded final plat of the subdivision, and the application for vacation would result in the violation of a covenant contained within such restrictive covenants, the application shall include an agreement signed by all parties subject to the covenants providing that the parties agree to terminate or alter the relevant covenants to accomplish the purpose of the vacation of the subdivision or portion thereof.

When the vacation application is specifically for a county road or a city or town street, the procedures for road vacation or street vacation in chapter 36.87 or 35.79 RCW shall be utilized for the road or street vacation. When the application is for the vacation of the entire final plat together with the roads and/or streets shown thereon, the procedure for vacation in this section shall be used, provided that vacations of roads may not be made that are prohibited under RCW 36.87.130.

The  city, town, or county shall give notice as provided in RCW 58.17.080  and shall conduct a public hearing on the application for a vacation if required by local ordinance and may approve or deny the application for vacation of the subdivision based on determining whether the public use and interest would be served by the vacation of the subdivision. If any portion of the land contained in the subdivision was dedicated to the public for public use or benefit, such land, if not deeded to the city, town, or county, shall be deeded to the city, town, or county unless the city, town, or county authority shall set forth findings that the public use would not be served in retaining title to those lands.

Title to the vacated property shall vest with the rightful owner as shown in the county records. If the vacated land is land that was dedicated to the public, for public use other than a road or street, and the  authority has found that retaining title to the land is not in the public interest, title thereto shall vest with the person or persons owning the property on each side thereof, as determined by the authorized official. When the road or street that is to be vacated was contained wholly within the subdivision and is part of the boundary of the subdivision, title to the vacated road or street shall vest with the owner or owners of property contained within the vacated subdivision.

This section shall not be construed as applying to the vacation of any plat of state-granted tidelands or shorelands.

## Section 28
When any person with an ownership interest in all or portions of a subdivision is interested in the alteration of any subdivision or the altering of any portion thereof, except as provided in RCW 58.17.040(6), that person or a duly authorized representative may submit an application to request the alteration to the authorized official as governed by the local ordinance of the city, town, or county where the subdivision is located. The application shall be signed by a majority of those persons having an ownership interest of lots, tracts, or parcels in the subject subdivision that are proposed to be altered; provided, that the application for the alteration of any lots, tracts, or parcels held in common ownership by all lot owners in the subdivision shall be signed by the majority of all such owners. If the subdivision is subject to restrictive covenants applicable to the final plat of the subdivision, and the application for alteration would result in the violation of a covenant, the application shall contain an agreement signed by all parties subject to the covenants providing that the parties agree to terminate or alter the relevant covenants to accomplish the purpose of the alteration of the subdivision or portion thereof.

Upon receipt of an application for alteration, the authorized official shall provide notice of the application to all owners of property within the subdivision, and as provided for in RCW 58.17.080

. The authorized official may deny or approve the application based on its determination whether the proposed alteration would serve the public use and interest . If any land within the subdivision proposed for alteration is part of an assessment district, any outstanding assessments shall be equitably divided and levied against the remaining lots, parcels, or tracts, or be levied equitably on the lots resulting from the alteration. If any land within the alteration contains a dedication to the general use of persons residing within the subdivision, such land may be altered and divided equitably between the adjacent properties.

After approval of the alteration, the authorized official shall order the applicant to produce a revised drawing of the approved alteration of the final plat , which after signature of the authorized official, shall be filed with the county auditor to become the lawful plat of the property.

This section shall not be construed as applying to the alteration or replatting of any plat of state-granted tidelands or shorelands.

## Section 29
Any hearing required by RCW 58.17.212or 58.17.215 may be administered by a hearings examiner as provided in RCW 58.17.070.

## Section 30
Following the public hearing with notice to property owners in the affected subdivision, the authorized official of a city, town, or county may, without complying with the requirements of RCW 58.17.215, grant an easement for ingress and egress or utilities over public property that is held as open space as part of the final plat where the open space is already used as a utility right-of-way or corridor, where other access is not feasible, and where the granting of the easement will not impair public access or authorize construction of physical barriers of any type.

## Section 31
Except for those divisions or alterations that are not subject to the requirements of this chapter as provided in RCW 58.17.040, as now or hereafter amended, permanent control monuments shall be established at each and every controlling corner on the boundaries of the  land being subdivided. A city, town, or county shall determine the number and location of permanent control monuments within the plat, if any.

## Section 32
The survey of the proposed subdivision and preparation of the plat shall be made by or under the supervision of a registered land surveyor who shall certify on the final plat that it is a true and correct representation of the lands  surveyed.

## Section 33
Whenever a survey of a proposed subdivision  reveals a discrepancy, the discrepancy shall be noted on the face of the final plat . Any discrepancy shall be disclosed in a title report prepared by a title insurer and issued after the filing of the final plat or short plat. As used in this section, "discrepancy" means:

1. A boundary hiatus;

2. An overlapping boundary; or

3. A physical appurtenance, which indicates encroachment, lines of possession, or conflict of title.

## Section 34
Any city, town, or county shall, by ordinance, regulate the procedure for the naming and numbering of subdivisions, streets, lots, and blocks . A city, town, or county shall provide a lot numbering system and system for assigning house addresses for subdivisions and lots created through an administrative lot split with such lot numbers and home addresses clearly shown on the recorded final plat or lot split survey.

## Section 35
1. Whenever a city, town, or county receives an application for the approval  of a subdivision that lies in whole or in part in an irrigation district organized pursuant to chapter 87.03 RCW, the responsible administrator shall give written notice of the application, including a legal description of the short subdivision and a location map, to the irrigation district. The irrigation district shall, after receiving the notice, submit to the responsible administrator who furnished the notice a statement with any information or conditions for approval that the irrigation district deems to be necessary regarding the proposed division's effect upon the structural integrity, including lateral support, of the irrigation district facilities, other risk exposures, and the safety of the public and irrigation district.

2. In addition to any other requirements imposed by the provisions of this chapter, the legislative authority of any city, town, or county shall not approve a  plat or final plat, as defined in RCW 58.17.020, for any subdivision,  lot, tract, parcel, or site which lies in whole or in part in an irrigation district organized pursuant to chapter 87.03 RCW unless there has been provided an irrigation water right-of-way for each parcel of land in such district. In addition, if the subdivision,  lot, tract, parcel, or site lies within land within the district classified as irrigable, completed irrigation water distribution facilities for such land may be required by the irrigation district by resolution, bylaw, or rule of general applicability as a condition for approval of the  final plat by the authorized official of the city, town, or county. Rights-of-way shall be evidenced by the respective plats submitted for final approval to the appropriate authorized official. In addition, if the subdivision,  lot, tract, parcel, or site to be platted is wholly or partially within an irrigation district of 200,000 acres or more and has been previously platted by the United States bureau of reclamation as a farm unit in the district, the  plat or final plat as defined in RCW 58.17.020 may not be approved by the city, town, or county without the approval of the irrigation district and the administrator or manager of the project of the bureau of reclamation, or its successor agency, within which that district lies. Compliance with the requirements of this section together with all other applicable provisions of this chapter shall be a prerequisite, within the expressed purpose of this chapter, to any sale, lease, or development of land in this state.

## Section 36
Whenever land within an approved plat or recorded final plat is used in a manner or for a purpose which violates any provision of this chapter, any provision of the local subdivision regulations, or any term or condition of plat approval prescribed for the plat by the local government, then the prosecuting attorney, or the attorney general if the prosecuting attorney shall fail to act, may commence an action to restrain and enjoin such use and compel compliance with the provisions of this chapter or the local regulations, or with such terms or conditions. The costs of such action may be taxed against the violator.

## Section 37
1. [Empty]

    a. Cities that are required to comply with the minimum density requirements under RCW 36.70A.635 must adopt or amend by ordinance, and incorporate into their development regulations, zoning regulations and other official controls consistent with the requirements of subsection (2) of this section, to take effect no later than July 1, 2026.

    b. In any city subject to the requirements of this section that has not adopted or amended ordinances, regulations, or other official controls as required under this section, the requirements of this section supersede, preempt, and invalidate any conflicting local development regulations.

2. Through ordinances, development regulations, zoning regulations, and other official controls as required under subsection (1) of this section, cities shall allow within a zone that primarily allows residential uses an administrative lot split to create one new residential lot if the following conditions are met:

    a. No more than one new lot is created through an administrative lot split. A lot split is not authorized for properties in zones that primarily allow nonresidential uses such as business, commercial, retail, and industrial;

    b. A lot created through an administrative lot split may be further segregated through either: (i) A unit lot subdivision to segregate middle housing units into separate legal parcels subject to the applicable residential density the city is required to allow pursuant to RCW 36.70A.635 or (ii) a subdivision provided the total number of lots in such subdivision does not exceed the density allowed under the applicable zoning;

    c. The donor lot and the new lot or lots resulting from the administrative lot split both meet the applicable minimum lot size allowed under RCW 36.70A.635; and

    d. The donor lot was not created through the splitting of a single-family residential lot authorized by this section.

3. A city shall establish procedural and substantive standards through which an administrative lot split is reviewed and approved in the same manner as a lot segregation under RCW 58.17.040(2) based upon a lot split survey showing the newly created lot and the remainder of the donor parcel. A lot split must be approved administratively and is not subject to an administrative appeal if the following criteria are met:

    a. The lots resulting from the lot split meet the minimum lot size under the city's development regulations;

    b. The sewer and water purveyors have issued certificates of availability to serve the newly created lot;

    c. Access rights are granted or conveyed as necessary on or before recording of the lot split survey to provide access for the maximum number of dwelling units that could be developed on the newly created lot, provided such access rights may be reduced consistent with a city's adopted codes, regulations, and design standards as applicable through review of a subsequent application for a building permit, unit lot subdivision, or subdivision application, if less than the maximum number of dwelling units is built on the newly created lot; and

    d. A proposed lot split may be conditioned upon dedication of right-of-way on the donor lot to the extent such dedication would otherwise be required under applicable codes, regulations, and design standards for the development or subdivision of the donor lot absent an administrative lot split. Similarly, a subsequent application for development of housing units on the newly created lot may be conditioned upon construction of frontage improvements to right-of-way adjacent to either the donor parcel or the newly created lots to the extent such improvements would be required under applicable codes, regulations, and design standards. An administrative lot split is not subject to subdivision requirements other than the requirement for a lot split survey and the requirements of this subsection (3).

4. A city subject to the requirements of this section may not impose a limit on the total number of dwelling units allowed on the new residential lot and the original lot that is less than the number of residential dwelling units allowed by the underlying zoning of the original lot prior to the administrative lot split.

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a city must deny an application for an administrative lot split if one or both resulting lots would not have sufficient developable land because of the presence of critical areas on the lot.

6. For the purposes of this section, "lot split survey" means the final survey prepared for filing for record with the county auditor and containing all elements and requirements for a lot split set forth in this section and in local regulations adopted under this chapter.

## Section 38
