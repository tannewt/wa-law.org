<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that electoral systems that deny race, color, or language minority groups an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice or impair their ability to otherwise participate in any state of the political process are inconsistent with the right to free and equal elections as provided by Article I, section 19 and Article VI, section 1 of the Washington state Constitution as well as protections found in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments to the United States Constitution. The well-established principle of &quot;one person, one vote&quot; and the prohibition on vote dilution have been consistently upheld in federal and state courts for more than fifty years.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that there is a history in Washington, as in the United States overall, of discrimination based on race, color, and language minority status, including in access to the political process. As a result of this history and persistent discrimination and socioeconomic inequities that bear on the right to vote, members of race, color, and language minority groups continue to face disparate burdens in exercising the franchise and participating effectively in the political process.</p>
<p>The legislature also finds that local government subdivisions are often prohibited from addressing these challenges because of Washington laws that narrowly prescribe the methods by which they may elect members of their legislative bodies. The legislature finds that in some cases, this has resulted in an improper dilution of voting power for these minority groups. The legislature intends to modify existing prohibitions in state laws so that these jurisdictions may voluntarily adopt changes on their own, in collaboration with affected community members, to remedy potential electoral issues so that minority groups have an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice or influence the outcome of an election.</p>
<p>In light of these findings, the legislature intends for this chapter to encourage participation in the franchise by all eligible voters and to provide voters in this state with a means to challenge all forms of racial discrimination in voting, including vote dilution and suppression.</p>
<p>The legislature intends for this chapter to be consistent with federal protections that may provide a similar remedy for minority groups. Remedies shall also be available where the drawing of crossover and coalition districts is able to address both vote dilution and racial polarization.</p>
<p>The legislature also intends for this chapter to be consistent with legal precedent from  (86 Wn. App. 165, 1997) that found that noncharter counties need not adhere to a single uniform county system of government, but that each county have the same &quot;authority available&quot; in order to be deemed uniform.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise. In applying these definitions and other terms in this chapter, courts may rely on relevant federal case law for guidance.</p>

<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, no political subdivision or government entity responsible for election administration may abridge the rights of voters who are members of a protected class or classes by implementing, imposing, or enforcing any election policy or practice, or taking any action or failing to take any action, that results in, is likely to result in, or is intended to result in a material disparate burden on the ability or opportunity of members of a protected class to vote or participate in any stage of the political process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not a violation of subsection (1) of this section if the political subdivision or government entity responsible for election administration demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The election policy or practice is necessary to significantly further a compelling, particularized interest; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no alternative election policy or practice that would result in less of a disparate burden on members of a protected class.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proof of intent to discriminate against a protected class by a political subdivision or a government entity responsible for election administration is not required for a cause of action to be sustained under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following are circumstances not relevant, and may not be considered, to demonstrate a violation of subsection (1) of this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The total number or share of protected class members not materially burdened by the election policy or practice;</p>

<li>
<p>The degree to which the election policy or practice has a long pedigree or was in widespread use at an earlier date;</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A class of people protected by this section may include a coalition of members of different racial, color, or language minority groups.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>No method of electing the governing body of a political subdivision may be imposed or applied in a manner that impairs the ability of members of a protected class or classes to have an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice as a result of the dilution of the votes of the members of a protected class or classes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A political subdivision is in violation of subsection (1) of this section when :</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Elections in the political subdivision exhibit polarized voting; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Members of a protected class or classes do not have an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice as a result of the dilution of the votes of the members of that protected class or classes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining whether there is polarized voting under this chapter, the court shall analyze election results including, but not limited to, elections of the governing body of the political subdivision, ballot measure elections, elections in which at least one candidate is a member of a protected class, and other electoral choices that affect the rights and privileges of members of a protected class. The court is not required to consider explanations, including partisanship, for why polarized voting under this chapter exists in the political subdivision to determine whether polarized voting under this chapter exists in the political subdivision. Elections conducted prior to the filing of an action pursuant to this chapter are more probative to establish the existence of polarized voting than elections conducted after the filing of an action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The election of candidates who are members of a protected class and who were elected prior to the filing of an action pursuant to this chapter shall not preclude a finding of polarized voting that results in an unequal opportunity for a protected class to elect candidates of their choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The equal opportunity to elect shall be assessed pragmatically, based on local election conditions, and may include crossover districts. No single factor is dispositive or necessary to establish a violation of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that members of a protected class are not geographically compact or concentrated to constitute a majority in a proposed or existing district-based election district shall not preclude a finding of a violation under this chapter, but may be a factor in determining a remedy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proof of intent on the part of the voters or elected officials to discriminate against a protected class is not required for a cause of action to be sustained.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other factors such as the history of discrimination, the use of electoral devices or other voting practices or procedures that may enhance the dilutive effects of at large elections, denial of access to those processes determining which groups of candidates will receive financial or other support in a given election, the extent to which members of a protected class bear the effects of past discrimination in areas such as education, employment, and health, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process, and the use of overt or subtle racial appeals in political campaigns are probative, but not necessary factors, to establish a violation of this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A class of people protected by this section may include a coalition of members of different racial, color, or language minority groups. A coalition of members of different protected classes is not required to demonstrate that each individual racial, color, or language minority group which comprises the coalition is cohesive, only that the coalition as a whole is cohesive.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>If the court orders a district-based remedy, the court must approve proposed district boundaries prior to their implementation. The court must determine that the proposed district boundaries will not violate this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementation of a district-based remedy is not precluded by the fact that members of a protected class do not constitute a numerical majority within a proposed district-based election district. If, in tailoring a remedy, the court orders the implementation of a district-based election district where the members of the protected class are not a numerical majority, the court shall do so in a manner that provides the protected class an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice. The court may also approve a district-based election system that provides the protected class the opportunity to join in a coalition of two or more protected classes to elect candidates of their choice if there is demonstrated political cohesion among the protected classes.</p>

<p>In tailoring a remedy after a finding of a violation of RCW 29A.92.030 or upon stipulation of the parties:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If the court's order providing a remedy or approving proposed districts, whichever is later, is issued during the period of time between the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November and on or before January 15th of the following year, the court shall order new elections, conducted pursuant to the remedy, to occur at the next succeeding general election. If a special filing period is required, filings for that office shall be reopened for a period of three business days, such three-day period to be fixed by the filing officer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court's order providing a remedy or approving proposed districts, whichever is later, is issued during the period of time between January 16th and on or before the first Monday of November, the next election will occur as scheduled and organized under the current electoral system, but the court shall order new elections to occur pursuant to the remedy at the general election the following calendar year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The remedy may provide for the political subdivision to hold elections for the members of its governing body at the same time as regularly scheduled elections for statewide or federal offices. All positions on the governing body must stand for election at the next election for the governing body, scheduled pursuant to this subsection (4). The governing body may subsequently choose to stagger the terms of its positions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within thirty days of the conclusion of any action filed under RCW 29A.92.100, the political subdivision must publish on the subdivision's website, the outcome and summary of the action, as well as the legal costs incurred by the subdivision. If the political subdivision does not have its own website, then it may publish on the county website.</p>

<p>No action under this chapter may be brought by any person against a political subdivision that has adopted a remedy to its electoral system after an action is filed that is approved by a court pursuant to RCW 29A.92.070 or implemented a court-ordered remedy pursuant to RCW 29A.92.110 for four years after adoption of the remedy if the political subdivision does not enact a change to or deviation from the remedy during this four-year period that would otherwise give rise to an action under this chapter. This subsection applies to violations or potential violations under section 3 of this act only if a subsequent action is based on the same election policy or practice for which the court has concluded that the political subdivision's remedy complies with this chapter.</p>
