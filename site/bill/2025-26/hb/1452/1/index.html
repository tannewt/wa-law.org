<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that auto theft has increased by 122 percent in the state of Washington from 2019 to 2023, with 54,187 incidents reported in 2023 alone. A recent study by Forbes found that Washington is the state most impacted by retail crime with a 24 percent increase in retail theft incidents between 2019 and 2022, and the Washington retail association estimates that retailers are losing approximately $3,000,000,000 a year from retail theft.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that auto and retail theft are not victimless property crimes; rather, those offenses significantly impact Washingtonians' safety and their ability to care for themselves and their families. An individual whose car is stolen is not able to get themself or others to work, school, the grocery store, medical appointments, and other essential activities. The prevalence of retail theft makes employees and customers feel unsafe in stores and parking lots due to the amount of theft occurring.</p>
<p>The legislature therefore intends to strengthen the penalties for motor vehicle theft and retail theft crimes, and to fund specialized prosecutors in counties with high incidents of motor vehicle and retail theft.</p>
