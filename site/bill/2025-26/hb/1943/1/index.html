<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes that increasing awareness of blood donation is crucial to addressing the growing need for a reliable and diverse blood supply. Just as bone marrow donation awareness has been shown to save lives, education about blood donation can empower students to become future donors, ensuring a safe and sustainable blood supply for patients in need.</p>
<p>By integrating blood donation awareness into existing instruction, students will gain knowledge about the life-saving impact of blood donation, eligibility requirements, and opportunities to participate in donation programs. The legislature intends for this instruction to complement existing health education requirements and increase opportunities for students to engage in civic and community health initiatives.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
