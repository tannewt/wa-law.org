<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Providing local governments with more options to increase residential capacity, especially in urban areas, consistent with RCW 43.21C.420, is essential to building affordable housing;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A history of racial segregation and displacement has led to disparities in access to education, living wage employment, affordable housing, and transportation, particularly for black and indigenous communities. This history has also allowed certain populations to obtain and build wealth and to access critical resources at the expense of others. Over time these factors have put pressure on, marginalized, and displaced many from these same communities; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Housing can drive economic growth within neighborhoods if developed with a focus on services, jobs, public improvements, open spaces, equity, and other elements that make housing vital and economically additive to nearby residents and the region.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to establish a land bank grant program which, using a land acquisition and deployment strategy, would produce more affordable low-income and moderate-income housing, ensuring any loss of affordable housing in areas of public infrastructure investment is exceeded by new affordable units, to enable all members of the workforce to live in the community in which they serve, including members of racial and ethnic groups disproportionately experiencing adverse housing outcomes, to make sure that the public improvement and housing investments in our state help to foster racial equity and rectify discriminatory practices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislative authority of a county may authorize an entity to serve as a land bank throughout the county.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The entity authorized as a land bank must be a public corporation established under RCW 35.21.730, a public housing authority established under chapter 35.82 RCW, or an entity exempt from taxation under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 501(c)(3) of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislative authorities of two or more contiguous counties may authorize a regional land bank to be administered in accordance with an interlocal agreement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A county authorizing a land bank must establish a land bank advisory board to provide oversight and technical assistance to the land bank. The county executive must appoint nine members to the land bank advisory board as follows:</p>

<p>A land bank may sell land to any entity for any purpose if it can clearly demonstrate that it is not financially feasible to lease the parcel, and the net proceeds are directed to subsidies for affordable housing and permanently affordable homeownership units or public improvement costs necessary for the development of affordable housing or permanently affordable homeownership.</p>

Consideration must include appraisal costs, debt service, all closing costs, and any other liabilities to the agency, municipality, or political subdivision.
