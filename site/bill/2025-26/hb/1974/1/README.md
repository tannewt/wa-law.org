# HB 1974 - Land banking authorities

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1974.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds the following:

    a. Providing local governments with more options to increase residential capacity, especially in urban areas, consistent with RCW 43.21C.420, is essential to building affordable housing;

    b. A history of racial segregation and displacement has led to disparities in access to education, living wage employment, affordable housing, and transportation, particularly for black and indigenous communities. This history has also allowed certain populations to obtain and build wealth and to access critical resources at the expense of others. Over time these factors have put pressure on, marginalized, and displaced many from these same communities; and

    c. Housing can drive economic growth within neighborhoods if developed with a focus on services, jobs, public improvements, open spaces, equity, and other elements that make housing vital and economically additive to nearby residents and the region.

2. The legislature intends to establish a land bank grant program which, using a land acquisition and deployment strategy, would produce more affordable low-income and moderate-income housing, ensuring any loss of affordable housing in areas of public infrastructure investment is exceeded by new affordable units, to enable all members of the workforce to live in the community in which they serve, including members of racial and ethnic groups disproportionately experiencing adverse housing outcomes, to make sure that the public improvement and housing investments in our state help to foster racial equity and rectify discriminatory practices.

## Section 2
1. The legislative authority of a county may authorize an entity to serve as a land bank throughout the county.

2. The entity authorized as a land bank must be a public corporation established under RCW 35.21.730, a public housing authority established under chapter 35.82 RCW, or an entity exempt from taxation under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 501(c)(3) of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended.

3. The legislative authorities of two or more contiguous counties may authorize a regional land bank to be administered in accordance with an interlocal agreement.

## Section 3
1. A county authorizing a land bank must establish a land bank advisory board to provide oversight and technical assistance to the land bank. The county executive must appoint nine members to the land bank advisory board as follows:

    a. One member with public or private real estate finance experience;

    b. One member with affordable housing development experience;

    c. One member with market rate housing development experience;

    d. One member with experience in neighborhood and community planning;

    e. One member with design and architecture experience;

    f. One member with economic development experience;

    g. One member representing advocates for affordable housing for marginalized communities;

    h. One member representing nonprofit housing developers; and

        i. One member representing renters in the region that is currently a renter.

2. The county executive must strive to make appointments that reflect the racial and ethnic makeup of the region the land banking authority will cover.

## Section 4
1. A land bank may acquire, hold, improve, fund, lease, sell, and engage in predevelopment contracting for land within the urban growth areas of the authorizing county.

2. Land acquisitions and dispositions must be consistent with any existing local, regional, or state housing plans and chapter 43.185B RCW, including the antidisplacement policies in the comprehensive plans of the authorizing county and any cities or towns within that county.

Any property conveyed to a land bank must have a clear title and address payment or forgiveness of any back taxes.

5. A land bank may lease or sell land to a housing developer at less than market rate in exchange for compliance with affordability requirements.

6. A land bank may negotiate sales with developers and is not required to sell or lease land to the highest bidder. A land bank may prioritize community needs, such as affordable housing, workforce housing, a grocery store, or expanded recreational space.

7. A land bank may sell land to any entity for any purpose if it can clearly demonstrate that it is not financially feasible to lease the parcel, and the net proceeds are directed to subsidies for affordable housing and permanently affordable homeownership units or public improvement costs necessary for the development of affordable housing or permanently affordable homeownership.

8. A land bank may lease properties for temporary uses, if more permanent options are not reasonably available.

9. A land bank must plan for and facilitate the following mix of housing:

    a. At least 33 percent affordable to extremely low-income, very low-income, and low-income households;

    b. No more than 33 percent at market rate; and

    c. Housing affordable to moderate-income households.

10. Land or property leased or sold by a land bank must include a covenant or deed restriction that the housing units developed or operated must maintain any affordability requirements for at least 99 years.

## Section 5
Each land bank must develop a land bank planning strategy that includes:

1. Land acquisition and disposition policies;

2. An equitable framework and equity goals;

3. Identification of a community vision that includes people who are most impacted by housing and transportation disparities;

4. An assessment of the current regulatory environment and identification of possible barriers to affordable housing development;

5. An assessment of displacement risk for current low-income residents and underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities;

6. A displacement mitigation plan that aligns with the city or county's antidisplacement policies;

7. Prioritization of homeownership opportunities for underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities, including first-time homeowners qualifying for the covenant homeownership program under chapter 43.181 RCW;

8. An assessment of alternate pathways to homeownership, including permanently affordable homeownership, community land trusts, and limited or shared equity cooperatives;

9. Consideration to the preservation of historical and cultural communities and investments in low-income, very low-income, extremely low-income, and moderate-income housing; and

10. Consideration of land that may be used for affordable housing.

## Section 6
1. Subject to appropriation, the housing finance commission shall develop and administer a competitive grant program for land banks. Grants may be used for:

    a. Land bank planning strategies;

    b. Public improvements; and

    c. Land acquisition.

2. Up to one percent of the grant funds may be used for the actual costs incurred by a land bank advisory board in the performance of its oversight and technical assistance duties.

3. To be eligible for a grant under this section, each county creating the land bank must:

    a. Levy a local tax dedicated to the construction, acquisition, or rehabilitation of housing affordable to households at or below 80 percent of area median income;

    b. Have removed barriers to the siting of permanent supportive housing; and

2. [Empty]

    a. The county authorizing a land bank must conduct an audit of all housing developed on land sold or leased by the land bank to ensure affordability and other conditions continue to be met. Audits must be performed on each property at least every three years.

    b. If an audit finds that an owner or manager of housing units is not in compliance with a minor or inadvertent variation of the affordability requirements, the county must direct the land bank to establish a plan to bring the owner or manager into compliance.

    c. If an audit finds that an owner or manager of housing units is not in compliance with a significant variance or variances from the affordability or other requirements, the county must provide notification of the noncompliance to any local, state, or federal agency awarding funds for the housing development.

## Section 8

Any transfer, lease, or other disposition of property authorized under this section must be consistent with existing locally adopted comprehensive plans as described in RCW 36.70A.070. The state, a municipality, or a political subdivision must prioritize the transfer of surplus land to any land bank authorized in the county in which the surplus land is located.

4. This section is deemed to provide a discretionary alternative method for the doing of the things authorized herein, and shall not be construed as imposing any additional condition upon the exercise of any other powers vested in any state agency, municipality, or political subdivision.

5. No transfer, lease, or other disposition of property for public benefit purposes made pursuant to any other provision of law prior to June 7, 2018, may be construed to be invalid solely because the parties thereto did not comply with the procedures of this section.

6. The transfer at no cost, lease, or other disposal of surplus real property for public benefit purposes is deemed a lawful purpose of any state agency, municipality, or political subdivision, for which accounts are kept on an enterprise fund or equivalent basis, regardless of the primary purpose or function of such agency.
