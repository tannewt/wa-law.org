<p>If an employee files a wage complaint with the department, the department may investigate the wage complaint. In determining which complaints will be investigated, the department must establish a written process by which wage complaints will be prioritized based on factors including, but not limited to, the harm to the affected employee, the severity of the complaint, the number of employees potentially affected, and the probability of retaliation. The department's enforcement priorities must be made publicly available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise resolved, when the department accepts a complaint, the department shall issue either a citation and notice of assessment or a determination of compliance no later than 60 days after the date on which the department accepted the wage complaint. The department may extend the time period by providing advance written notice to the employee and the employer setting forth good cause for an extension of the time period and specifying the duration of the extension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may not investigate any alleged violation of a wage payment requirement that occurred more than three years before the date that the employee filed the wage complaint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall send the citation and notice of assessment or the determination of compliance to both the employer and the employee by service of process or using a method by which the mailing can be tracked or the delivery can be confirmed to their last known addresses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During an investigation, if the department discovers information suggesting additional violations of any requirements related to compensation under this chapter, or any associated rule, the department may expand its investigation and take appropriate enforcement action to ensure compliance, without any additional complaints filed. The department may also initiate an investigation on behalf of one or more employees for a violation of any requirement related to compensation under this chapter or any associated rule, when the department has reason to believe a violation has occurred or will occur.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may conduct a consolidated investigation for any alleged violation of a requirement related to compensation under this chapter or associated rule when there are common questions of law or fact involving employees of the same employer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the department determines that an employer has violated a wage payment requirement and issues to the employer a citation and notice of assessment, the department may order the employer to pay employees all wages owed, including interest of one percent per month on all wages owed, to the employee. The wages and interest owed must be calculated from the first date wages were owed to the employee, except that the department may not order the employer to pay any wages and interest that were owed more than three years before the date the wage complaint was filed with the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the department determines that the violation of the wage payment requirement was a willful violation, the department also may order the employer to pay the department a civil penalty as specified in (a) of this subsection. The department shall assess a civil penalty against any repeat willful violator or any willful violator where the employer previously settled or otherwise resolved a wage complaint more than once in the preceding 12 months or three times in the preceding 24 months.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>A civil penalty for a willful violation of a wage payment requirement shall be not less than $1,500 or an amount equal to 10 percent of the total amount of unpaid wages, whichever is greater. Beginning in 2030, and every three years thereafter, the department shall increase the base penalty amount by the cumulative rate of inflation, rounded to the nearest 50 dollars, using the same process provided in RCW 49.46.020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall, by rule, create a matrix of criteria for the imposition of penalties. In creating the matrix, the department must consider the appropriateness of the penalty with respect to the number of affected employees of the employer subject to the penalty, the gravity of the violation, the size of the employer's business, the good faith of the employer, the source or cause of any error, the promptness of remedy, the employer's history of previous complaints and violations, including enhancements for repeat willful violations, or other factors the department considers relevant.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may not assess a civil penalty if the employer reasonably relied on: (i) A rule related to any wage payment requirement; (ii) a written order, ruling, approval, opinion, advice, determination, or interpretation of the director; or (iii) an interpretive or administrative policy issued by the department and filed with the office of the code reviser. In accordance with the department's retention schedule obligations under chapter 40.14 RCW, the department shall maintain a complete and accurate record of all written orders, rulings, approvals, opinions, advice, determinations, and interpretations for purposes of determining whether an employer is immune from civil penalties under (b)(ii) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may waive any civil penalty assessed against an employer under this section if all of the following conditions are met: The employer is not a repeat willful violator, the employer has not previously settled or otherwise resolved a wage complaint more than once in the preceding 12 months or three times in the preceding 24 months, and the director determines that the employer has provided payment to the employee of all wages and interest that the department determined that the employer owed to the employee, including interest, within 10 business days of the employer's receipt of the citation and notice of assessment from the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may  reduce at any time a civil penalty assessed under this section if the director determines that the employer paid all wages and interest owed to an employee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Until the effective date of this section, the department shall deposit civil penalties paid under this section in the supplemental pension fund established under RCW 51.44.033. Beginning on the effective date of this section, the department shall deposit all civil penalties paid under this chapter in the wage recovery account created under section 3 of this act.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon payment by an employer, and acceptance by an employee, of all wages and interest assessed by the department in a citation and notice of assessment issued to the employer, the fact of such payment by the employer, and of such acceptance by the employee, shall: (a) Constitute a full and complete satisfaction by the employer of all specific wage payment requirements addressed in the citation and notice of assessment; and (b) bar the employee from initiating or pursuing any court action or other judicial or administrative proceeding based on the specific wage payment requirements addressed in the citation and notice of assessment. The citation and notice of assessment shall include a notification and summary of the specific requirements of this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The applicable statute of limitations for civil actions is tolled for an employee's wage complaint against an employer once filed with the department. For the purposes of this subsection, a complaint filed with the department begins on the date the employee files the wage complaint with the department and ends when: (a) The wage complaint is finally determined through a final and binding citation and notice of assessment or determination of compliance;  (b) the department notifies the employer and the employee in writing that the wage complaint has been otherwise resolved or that the employee has elected to terminate the department's administrative action under RCW 49.48.085; or (c) the department notifies the worker the wage complaint will not be accepted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For all wage complaints filed on or after January 1, 2024, if the department offers the employer the option to resolve a wage complaint without a citation and notice of assessment, and the employer chooses to accept the offer, any settlement must include interest of one percent per month on all amounts owed. The employee may request a waiver or reduction of interest as part of the settlement process.</p>

<p>Subject to the availability of funds appropriated for this purpose, the wage recovery program is created and administered by the department. The purpose of the wage recovery program is to allow the department to disburse funds to unpaid low-wage employees, prior to the department issuing a citation and notice of assessment or collecting unpaid wages and interest from an employer, if the employee would otherwise experience immediate economic harm due to the nonpayment of wages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may adopt rules to administer the program.</p>

<p>Beginning July 1, 2028, or when the account created under section 3 of this act contains at least $130,000, whichever is later, an employee is eligible to recover from the wage recovery program if each of the following conditions is satisfied:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The employee has filed a wage complaint with the department under RCW 49.48.083 and the department has investigated and determined that the wage complaint has merit;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The employee requested to be considered a recipient of funds from the wage recovery program;</p>

<li>
<p>The employee's earnings during the preceding 12 months were less than the maximum amount established by the department by rule and according to the process provided by rule;</p>

<p>The employee attests that without relief from the wage recovery program, the employee will suffer immediate economic harm; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The employee, as a condition of receiving funds under the wage recovery program, has waived the ability to appeal the citation and any notice of assessment as well as any private right of action.</p>

<p>To help prevent immediate economic harm to the employee, the department should attempt to disburse funds after the department has determined the complaint has merit and at the earliest possible point in the investigation process, as determined by the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining an eligible employee's need for funds to prevent immediate economic harm, the department may identify other factors for consideration, such as resources available to the employee, the employee's current employment status, and family size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may determine the priority of payments made between eligible employees and whether to issue funds for eligible employees. Factors to consider in prioritizing applications for funds from the program should include, but are not limited to, the severity of the potential economic harm to the employee, whether the department is likely to recover the unpaid wages and interest from the employer, and availability of funds to be distributed throughout the year given the seasonality of some industries.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>An employee receiving funds from the wage recovery program may not pursue collection, or authorize another entity other than the department to pursue collection on the employee's behalf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When an employer pays the department wages and interest for a wage complaint assigned to the department, the department shall deposit into the wage recovery account created under section 3 of this act the amounts necessary to reimburse the account for the disbursements made to the employee, plus interest. The department shall pay any remaining payment of wages and interest by the employer on the claim to the employee.</p>
</li>

<p>If a driver files a complaint with the department alleging that a transportation network company failed to provide any compensation amounts due to the driver under RCW 49.46.300, the department shall investigate the complaint under this section. Unless otherwise resolved, the department shall issue either a citation and notice of assessment or a determination of compliance no later than 60 days after the date on which the department received the compensation-related complaint.

<li>
<p>If the department determines that the compensation-related violation was a willful violation, and the transportation network company fails to take corrective action, the department also may order the transportation network company to pay the department a civil penalty as specified in (a) of this subsection.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A civil penalty for a willful violation shall be not less than $1,000 or an amount equal to 10 percent of the total amount of unpaid compensation per claimant, whichever is greater.

<li>
<p>The department may not assess a civil penalty if the transportation network company reasonably relied on: (i) A rule related to any requirements in this section; (ii) a written order, ruling, approval, opinion, advice, determination, or interpretation of the director; or (iii) an interpretive or administrative policy issued by the department and filed with the office of the code reviser. In accordance with the department's retention schedule obligations under chapter 40.14 RCW, the department shall maintain a complete and accurate record of all written orders, rulings, approvals, opinions, advice, determinations, and interpretations for purposes of determining whether a transportation network company is immune from civil penalties under this subsection (3)(b).</p>
</li>

<p>Upon receipt of a notice of appeal, the director shall assign the hearing to an administrative law judge of the office of administrative hearings to conduct the hearing and issue an initial order. The hearing and review procedures shall be conducted in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW, and the standard of review by the administrative law judge of an appealed citation and notice of assessment, an appealed determination of compliance, or an appealed assessment of a civil penalty shall be de novo. Any party who seeks to challenge an initial order shall file a petition for administrative review with the director within 30 days after service of the initial order. The director shall conduct administrative review in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director shall issue all final orders after appeal of the initial order. The final order of the director is subject to judicial review in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW.</p>

<p>A driver who has filed a complaint under this section with the department may elect to terminate the department's administrative action, thereby preserving any private right of action, if any exists, by providing written notice to the department within 10 business days after the driver's receipt of the department's citation and notice of assessment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the driver elects to terminate the department's administrative action: (a) The department shall immediately discontinue its action against the transportation network company; (b) the department shall vacate a citation and notice of assessment already issued by the department to the transportation network company; and (c) the citation and notice of assessment, and any related findings of fact or conclusions of law by the department, and any payment or offer of payment by the transportation network company of the compensation, including interest, assessed by the department in the citation and notice of assessment, shall not be admissible in any court action or other judicial or administrative proceeding.</p>

<li>
<p>Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or affect: (a) The right of any driver to pursue any judicial, administrative, or other action available with respect to a transportation network company; (b) the right of the department to pursue any judicial, administrative, or other action available with respect to a driver that is identified as a result of a complaint for a violation of RCW 49.46.300; or (c) the right of the department to pursue any judicial, administrative, or other action available with respect to a transportation network company in the absence of a complaint for a violation of RCW 49.46.300. For purposes of this subsection, &quot;driver&quot; means a driver other than a driver who has filed a complaint with the department and who thereafter has elected to terminate the department's administrative action as provided in subsection (1) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a final order is issued under this section, and served as provided in subsection (1) of this section, if a transportation network company defaults in the payment of: (a) Any compensation determined by the department to be owed to a driver, including interest; or (b) any civil penalty ordered by the department under this section, the director may file with the clerk of any county within the state a warrant in the amount of the payment plus any filing fees. The clerk of the county in which the warrant is filed shall immediately designate a superior court cause number for the warrant, and the clerk shall cause to be entered in the judgment docket under the superior court cause number assigned to the warrant, the name of the transportation network company mentioned in the warrant, the amount of payment due plus any filing fees, and the date when the warrant was filed. The aggregate amount of the warrant as docketed becomes a lien upon the title to, and interest in, all real and personal property of the transportation network company against whom the warrant is issued, the same as a judgment in a civil case docketed with the superior court clerk. The sheriff shall proceed upon the warrant in all respects and with like effect as prescribed by law with respect to execution or other process issued against rights or property upon judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction. The warrant so docketed is sufficient to support the issuance of writs of garnishment in favor of the state in a manner provided by law in case of judgment, wholly or partially unsatisfied. The clerk of the court is entitled to a filing fee which will be added to the amount of the warrant. A copy of the warrant shall be served on the transportation network company, as provided in subsection (1) of this section, within three days of filing with the clerk.</p>

<p>Whenever any transportation network company quits business, sells out, exchanges, or otherwise disposes of the transportation network company's business or stock of goods, any person who becomes a successor to the business becomes liable for the full amount of any outstanding citation and notice of assessment or penalty against the transportation network company's business under this chapter if, at the time of the conveyance of the business, the successor has: (a) Actual knowledge of the fact and amount of the outstanding citation and notice of assessment; or (b) a prompt, reasonable, and effective means of accessing and verifying the fact and amount of the outstanding citation and notice of assessment from the department. If the citation and notice of assessment or penalty is not paid in full by the transportation network company within 10 days of the date of the sale, exchange, or disposal, the successor is liable for the payment of the full amount of the citation and notice of assessment or penalty, and payment thereof by the successor must, to the extent thereof, be deemed a payment upon the purchase price.

<li>
<p>It is unlawful for a transportation network company to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of any driver right provided under or in connection with RCW 49.46.300 and 49.46.210(5). This means a transportation network company may not use a driver's exercise of any of the rights provided under RCW 49.46.300 and 49.46.210(5) as a factor in any action that adversely affects the driver's use of the transportation network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is unlawful for a transportation network company to adopt or enforce any policy that counts the use of earned paid sick time for a purpose authorized under RCW 49.46.210(1) (b) and (c) as time off the platform that may lead to or result in temporary or permanent deactivation by the transportation network company against the driver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is unlawful for a transportation network company to take any adverse action against a driver because the driver has exercised their rights provided under RCW 49.46.300 and 49.46.210(5). Such rights include, but are not limited to: Filing an action, or instituting or causing to be instituted any proceeding under or related to RCW 49.46.300 and 49.46.210(5), or testifying or intending to testify in any such proceeding related to any rights provided under RCW 49.46.300 and 49.46.210(5).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adverse action means any action taken or threatened by a transportation network company against a driver for the driver's exercise of rights under RCW 49.46.300 and 49.46.210(5).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A driver who believes that he or she was subject to retaliation by a transportation network company for the exercise of any driver right under RCW 49.46.300 and 49.46.210(5) may file a complaint with the department within 180 days of the alleged retaliatory action. The department may, at its discretion, extend the 180-day period on recognized equitable principles or because of extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the department. The department may extend the 180-day period when there is a preponderance of evidence that the transportation network company has concealed or misled the driver regarding the alleged retaliatory action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a driver files a timely complaint with the department alleging retaliation, the department shall investigate the complaint and issue either a citation and notice of assessment or a determination of compliance within 90 days after the date on which the department received the complaint, unless the complaint is otherwise resolved. The department may extend the period by providing advance written notice to the driver and the transportation network company setting forth good cause for an extension of the period, and specifying the duration of the extension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may consider a complaint to be otherwise resolved when the driver and the transportation network company reach a mutual agreement to remedy any retaliatory action, or the driver voluntarily and on the driver's own initiative withdraws the complaint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the department's investigation finds that the driver's allegation of retaliation cannot be substantiated, the department shall issue a determination of compliance to the driver and the transportation network company detailing such finding.</p>

<li>
<p>If the department's investigation finds that the transportation network company retaliated against the driver, and the complaint is not otherwise resolved, the department may, at its discretion, notify the transportation network company that the department intends to issue a citation and notice of assessment, and may provide up to 30 days after the date of such notification for the transportation network company to take corrective action to remedy the retaliatory action. If the complaint is not otherwise resolved, then the department shall issue a citation and notice of assessment. The department's citation and notice of assessment may:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Order the transportation network company to make payable to the driver earnings that the driver did not receive due to the transportation network company's retaliatory action, including interest of one percent per month on all earnings owed.

</li>
<li>
<p>During an investigation of the driver's retaliation complaint, if the department discovers information suggesting alleged violations by the transportation network company of the driver's other rights under this chapter, and all applicable rules, the department may investigate and take appropriate enforcement action without requiring the driver to file a new or separate complaint. In the event the department so expands an investigation, it shall provide reasonable notice to the transportation network company that it is doing so. If the department determines that the transportation network company violated additional rights of the driver under this chapter, and all applicable rules, the transportation network company may be subject to additional enforcement actions for the violation of such rights. If the department discovers information alleging the transportation network company retaliated against or otherwise violated rights of other drivers under this chapter, and all applicable rules, the department may launch further investigation under this chapter, and all applicable rules, without requiring additional complaints to be filed.</p>

<li>
<p>The department may prioritize retaliation investigations as needed to allow for timely resolution of complaints.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section precludes a driver's right to pursue private legal action, if any exists.</p>
