<li>
<p>No person in this state may purchase or possess a firearm unless that person is:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Insured under a firearm liability policy or covered by a firearm liability bond meeting the requirements of subsection (2) of this section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Self-insured as provided in subsection (3) of this section; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Covered by a certificate of deposit meeting the requirements of subsection (4) of this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compliance with this requirement constitutes financial responsibility for the purpose of this section. Proof of financial responsibility to purchase or possess a firearm must be provided on the request of a dealer or law enforcement officer in the format specified under subsection (5) of this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Firearm Liability Policy and Bond Requirements.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A firearm liability policy or bond under this section must: (i) Be issued by an insurance company or surety company authorized to do business in this state; (ii) provide at least $25,000 of coverage per incident arising from accidental or unintentional discharge of the covered firearm causing injury, death, or property damage; and (iii) identify the specific firearm covered by the policy or bond.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Firearm liability policies and bonds must be obtained on a per-firearm basis, with a separate policy or bond required for each distinct firearm.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Self-Insurance Requirements.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Any person possessing more than 25 firearms may qualify as a self-insurer by obtaining a certificate of self-insurance issued by the department of licensing as provided in (b) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of licensing may, in its discretion, upon the application of such a person, issue a certificate of self-insurance when it is satisfied that such person is possessed and will continue to be possessed of the ability to pay a judgment obtained against such person arising from accidental or unintentional discharge of their firearms causing injury, death, or property damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon not less than five days' notice and a hearing pursuant to such notice, the department of licensing may upon reasonable grounds cancel a certificate of self-insurance. Failure to pay any judgment within 30 days after such judgment shall have become final shall constitute a reasonable ground for the cancellation of a certificate of self-insurance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certificate of Deposit Requirements.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Proof of financial responsibility may be evidenced by a certificate issued by the department of licensing establishing that the person named therein has deposited with the department $25,000 in cash, or securities such as may legally be purchased by savings banks or for trust funds of a market value of $25,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certificates of deposit must be obtained on a per-firearm basis, with a separate certificate required for each distinct firearm.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Proof of Financial Responsibility.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Whenever an insurance or surety company issues or renews a firearm liability insurance policy or bond, the company shall provide the policyholder or bondholder with an identification card as specified by the department of licensing. At the policyholder's or bondholder's request, the insurance or surety company shall provide the policyholder or bondholder a card for each firearm covered under the policy or bond. The card required by this subsection may be provided in either paper or electronic format. Acceptable electronic formats include the display of electronic images on a cellular phone or any other type of portable electronic device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of licensing shall adopt rules specifying the type, style, and content of identification cards to be used for proof of compliance with this section, including the method for issuance of such identification cards by persons or organizations providing proof of compliance through self-insurance, certificate of deposit, or bond.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever a law enforcement officer asks any person purchasing or possessing a firearm to display proof of financial responsibility, failure to display such proof creates a presumption that the person has not complied with the financial responsibility requirement of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failure to provide proof of financial responsibility to purchase or possess a firearm at the request of a dealer while purchasing a firearm, or at the request of a law enforcement officer while possessing a firearm, is a class 1 civil infraction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, when a person uses a portable electronic device to display proof of financial responsibility to a law enforcement officer, the officer may only view the proof of financial responsibility and is otherwise prohibited from viewing any other content on the portable electronic device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever a person presents a portable electronic device pursuant to this section, that person assumes all liability for any damage to the portable electronic device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a person given notice of a civil infraction for a violation of this section appears in person before the court and provides written evidence that at the time the person was given notice, he or she was in compliance with the financial responsibility requirements of this section, the notice of civil infraction shall be dismissed and the court may assess court administrative costs of $25 at the time of dismissal. In lieu of personal appearance, a person given notice of a civil infraction for a violation of this section may, before the date scheduled for the person's appearance before the court, submit by mail to the court written evidence that, at the time the person was given notice, he or she was in compliance with the financial responsibility requirements of this section, in which case the notice of civil infraction shall be dismissed without cost, except that the court may assess court administrative costs of $25 at the time of dismissal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any person who knowingly provides false evidence of financial responsibility to a dealer, law enforcement officer, or court, including an expired or canceled insurance policy, bond, or certificate of deposit, is guilty of a misdemeanor.</p>

<p>CAUTION: Although state and local laws do not differ, federal law and state law on the possession of firearms differ.
