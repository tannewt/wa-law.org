<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that delays in processing distributions from retirement accounts, including rollovers to individual retirement accounts, can cause significant financial harm to Washington consumers through lost investment opportunities and lost interest earnings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that consumers have little practical recourse when financial institutions retain funds for extended periods after a valid distribution request has been submitted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to protect consumers by establishing reasonable timelines for the transmission of retirement distribution funds and to require financial institutions to compensate consumers when delays exceed those timelines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this chapter is intended to regulate employee benefit plans governed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974, but rather to regulate the business practices of financial institutions doing business in Washington state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</p>

<p>&quot;Qualified retirement plan&quot; means a retirement plan in compliance with applicable federal law including:</p>
<ol type="a">

<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A financial institution that receives a valid distribution request shall transmit the funds to the consumer or to the receiving financial institution no later than 15 business days after the request is received.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A financial institution may request supplemental information from the consumer, but such request does not toll the 15-business day period unless the supplemental information is necessary to complete the valid distribution request and the consumer is notified in writing within three business days.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>

</li>
<li>
<p>Interest begins accruing on the 16th business day and continues until all funds are successfully transmitted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interest paid under this section must be separate from, and in addition to, the transmitted retirement account distribution amount.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A consumer harmed by a violation of this chapter may bring a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
