# HB 1535 - Dental insurance practices

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1535.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that the dental benefits system in Washington is failing both patients and dental professionals, as it primarily benefits corporate insurance companies rather than those it is meant to serve. Insurance executives, whose bonuses increase when payouts to patients decrease, dominate the system, leaving patients and providers struggling to navigate a system that prioritizes profits over care.

Therefore, the legislature seeks to reform this broken system by putting patients at the center, ensuring the system works for all stakeholders, especially those in need. The goal of this act is to bring equity, transparency, and fairness to the dental insurance market. By aligning dental insurance protections with those already established for medical insurance, it ensures patients have the same rights and protections. The focus is on making dental benefits work for people, not corporations. A key element of the reform is protecting patient choice. Patients should be able to choose a trusted dentist and receive the full benefits they pay for, regardless of network restrictions. Therefore, the legislature intends to eliminate corporate restrictions that limit care and undermine the patient-provider relationship.

Additionally, the legislature intends to mandate that at least 85 percent of premium dollars be spent directly on care, ensuring that patients get value for what they pay. The legislature further intends for patients to request an independent review of denied claims, empowering them to receive necessary care, as well as tackling additional actions by insurance companies taking advantage of patients and providers. This act addresses inequities in the dental benefits system, especially for vulnerable populations, by creating a fairer, more transparent market that improves access to care and reduces out-of-pocket costs for all Washington residents.

## Section 2
1. [Empty]

    a. A limited health care service contractor that offers coverage for dental care services shall permit a treating dentist, in consultation with the covered person, to make all decisions on dental services provided to the covered person, rather than making such decisions through contracts or agreements between the dentist and the limited health care service contractor.

    b. Consistent with (a) of this subsection, the limited health care service contractor may not:

        i. Deny coverage for services provided by the dentist based on an independent diagnosis made by the limited health care service contractor or an employee or agent of the limited health care service contractor; or
