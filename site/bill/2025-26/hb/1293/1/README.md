        ii. The court may, in addition to or in lieu of part or all of the cleanup restitution payment, order the person to pick up and remove litter from the property, with prior permission of the legal owner or, in the case of public property, of the agency managing the property.

5. It is a class 1 civil infraction as provided in RCW 7.80.120 for a person to discard, in violation of this section, potentially dangerous litter in any amount.

    c. How to reduce the most commonly littered types of litter, such as construction and demolition debris and cigarette butts; and

    d. How to reduce the cost-per-mile of litter cleanup along state roadways and the root causes of why the average amount of litter per mile far exceeds the average amount of litter per mile along roadways in other states.

4. The department of ecology must submit a status update to the appropriate committees of the legislature by January 15, 2026, and a final report consisting of the recommendations of the littering solutions task force by November 15, 2026.
