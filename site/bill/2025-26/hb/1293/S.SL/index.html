<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that litter is a persistent challenge that sullies public spaces, damages natural habitats, and pollutes the environment. Improperly disposing of trash poses significant risks to public health, our environment, and the economy.</p>
<p>The legislature also finds that single-use plastic bags are one of the most commonly found items that litter state roads, beaches, and other public spaces. Plastic bag litter is known to harm animals, particularly aquatic species, and contributes to the proliferation of microplastics, which pose significant threats to human health. Encouraging the adoption of alternatives to plastic bags, such as reusable carryout bags, reduces plastic waste. While thicker plastic bags may be more durable and reusable, initial research has demonstrated that many customers may still use them as single-use bags, and consequently, thicker plastic bags contribute to more plastic waste.</p>
<p>The legislature also finds that when specifically tailored, penalties and fees act as effective deterrents to harmful behaviors, such as littering, and can lead to the adoption of more sustainable practices.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to discourage littering and the proliferation of plastic waste by enhancing penalties for littering, delaying requirements relating to increasing the thickness of reusable plastic bags, and imposing new penalties for the sale of thicker plastic bags. The legislature also intends to direct the fees collected from the new penalties to the waste reduction, recycling, and litter control account to address the negative impacts of litter.</p>
