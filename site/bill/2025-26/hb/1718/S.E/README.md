        iii. A physician well-being program, so long as the license holder is competent to practice with reasonable skill and safety. If the license holder is not competent to practice with reasonable skill and safety, or if a patient has been harmed, the license holder shall be reported by the physician well-being program medical director or other licensee to the disciplining authority according to requirements established and adopted in rule by the Washington medical commission or, if permitted by rule, referred to a physicians health program or voluntary substance use disorder monitoring program approved under RCW 18.130.175.
