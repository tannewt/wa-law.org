# HB 1714 - Small business risk pooling

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1714.pdf)

## Section 1
This chapter is intended to provide authority for two or more small business entities to participate in a joint self-insurance program covering property or liability risks. This chapter provides small business entities with the authority to jointly self-insure property and liability risks, jointly purchase insurance or reinsurance, and contract for risk management, claims, and administrative services with other small business entities. This chapter must be liberally construed to grant small business entities maximum flexibility in jointly self-insuring to the extent the self-insurance programs are operated in a safe and sound manner. This chapter is intended to require prior approval for the establishment of every joint self-insurance program. In addition, this chapter is intended to require every joint self-insurance program for small business entities established under this chapter to notify the state of the existence of the program and to comply with the regulatory and statutory standards governing the management and operation of the programs as provided in this chapter. This chapter is not intended to authorize or regulate self-insurance of unemployment compensation under chapter 50.44 RCW or industrial insurance under chapter 51.14 RCW.

## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Program" means a joint self-insurance program authorized under section 3 of this act.

2. "Property and liability risks" includes the risk of property damage or loss sustained by a small business entity and the risk of claims arising from the tortious or negligent conduct or any error or omission of the entity, its officers, employees, agents, or volunteers as a result of a claim that may be made against the entity.

3. "Self-insurance" means a formal program of advance funding and management of entity financial exposure to a risk of loss that is not transferred through the purchase of an insurance policy or contract.

4. "Small business entity" means a corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, general cooperative association, limited cooperative association, sole proprietorship, or another type of for-profit business entity, so long as the entity has no more than 20 employees employed on average over the latest 24 calendar months, counting all employees regardless of the hours worked or temporary status of an employee, provided that if an entity has not been in business for 24 months, the average number of employees is used for each of the pay periods during which it has been in business.

5. "State risk manager" means the risk manager of the office of risk management within the department of enterprise services.

## Section 3
1. A small business entity may join or form a joint self-insurance program together with one or more other small business entities, and may jointly purchase insurance or reinsurance with one or more other small business entities for property and liability risks only as permitted under this chapter. Small business entities may contract for or hire personnel to provide risk management, claims, and administrative services in accordance with this chapter.

2. The agreement to form a program may include the organization of a separate legal or administrative entity with powers delegated to the entity. The entity may include or form another entity.

3. If provided for in the organizational documents, a program may, in conformance with this chapter:

    a. Contract or otherwise provide for risk management and loss control services;

    b. Contract or otherwise provide legal counsel for the defense of claims and other legal services;

    c. Consult with the commissioner and the state risk manager;

    d. Jointly purchase insurance and reinsurance coverage in a form and amount as provided for in the organizational documents;

    e. Obligate the program's participants to pledge funds or revenues to secure the obligations or pay the expenses of the program, including the establishment of a reserve fund for coverage, including an additional assessment if the reserve fund or the program's revenue or assets are insufficient to cover the program's liabilities; and

    f. Possess any other powers and perform all other functions reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.

4. Every program governed by this chapter must appoint the state risk manager as its attorney to receive service of, and upon whom must be served, all legal process issued against the program in this state upon causes of action arising in this state.

    a. Service upon the state risk manager as attorney constitutes service upon the program. Service upon programs subject to this chapter may only occur by service upon the state risk manager. At the time of service, the plaintiff shall pay to the state risk manager a fee to be set by the state risk manager, taxable as costs in the action.

    b. With the initial filing for approval with the state risk manager, each program must designate by name and address the person to whom the state risk manager must forward legal process that is served upon him or her. The program may change this person by filing a new designation.

    c. The appointment of the state risk manager as attorney is irrevocable, binds any successor in interest or to the assets or liabilities of the program, and remains in effect as long as there is in force in this state any contract made by the program or liabilities or duties arising from the contract.

    d. The state risk manager shall keep a record of the day and hour of service upon him or her of all legal process. A copy of the process, by registered mail with return receipt requested, must be sent by the state risk manager to the person designated to receive legal process by the program in its most recent designation filed with the state risk manager. Proceedings may not commence against the program, and the program is not required to appear, plead, or answer, until the expiration of 40 days after the date of service upon the state risk manager.

    e. For any legal process issued against the program for causes of action arising outside of this state, the program shall provide the state risk manager a copy of such claim.

## Section 4
This chapter does not apply to a small business entity that:

2. If the state risk manager denies a request for approval, the state risk manager shall specify in detail the reasons for denial and the manner in which the program fails to meet the requirements of this chapter or any rules adopted in accordance with this chapter.

If the state risk manager determines that a joint self-insurance program covering property or liability risks is in violation of this chapter or is operating in an unsafe financial condition, the state risk manager may issue and serve upon the program an order to cease and desist from the violation or practice.

    a. The state risk manager shall deliver the cease and desist order to the appropriate entity or entities directly or mail it to the appropriate entity or entities by certified mail with return receipt requested.

    b.

The state risk manager shall approve or disapprove the proposed change within 60 days of receipt of the notice. If the state risk manager denies a requested change, the state risk manager shall specify in detail the reasons for the denial and the manner in which the program would fail to meet the requirements of this chapter or any rules adopted in accordance with this chapter.

An employee or official of a participating small business entity in a program may not accept or solicit anything of value for personal benefit or for the benefit of others under circumstances in which it can be reasonably inferred that the employee's or official's independence of judgment is impaired with respect to the management and operation of the program.
