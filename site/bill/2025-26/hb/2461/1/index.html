<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature makes the following findings:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is necessary to establish a Washington state commission on boys and men to address systemic challenges facing boys, male youth, and men in Washington state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A successful society requires its institutions to recognize and respond to the distinct characteristics and needs of both males and females. Disaggregated data by sex demonstrate that sustained efforts to expand opportunity for women and girls have resulted in significant gains and have strengthened Washington state and the nation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many institutional frameworks have not sufficiently accounted for male-specific developmental, biological, and social needs, contributing to persistent disparities affecting boys and men across education, public safety, health, housing, and workforce participation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disaggregated data demonstrate significant and persistent disparities affecting boys and men in Washington state, including disproportionate involvement in the criminal and juvenile justice systems, higher rates of homelessness, substance abuse, violent victimization, and suicide;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research demonstrates a strong association between father absence and increased risks of negative outcomes for boys, including justice system involvement, educational disengagement, and substance abuse;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Addiction is a significant contributing factor to incarceration, family instability, and long-term social withdrawal, and that these outcomes impose substantial social and fiscal costs on the state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Biological and developmental differences between males and females influence behavior, learning, health, and social outcomes, and that institutions should account for these differences while minimizing bias and stereotypes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stronger outcomes for men and fathers contribute to stronger families, safer communities, and improved long-term social stability;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A commission on boys and men is necessary to assess systemic, cultural, and institutional factors contributing to these outcomes and to develop evidence-based policy recommendations to improve outcomes for boys and men; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improving outcomes for boys and men is not intended to diminish gains made by women and girls, but to strengthen opportunity, stability, and well-being for all residents of Washington state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>

</li>
<li>
<p>Workforce participation, career pathways, and economic stability, including transitions from education to employment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fatherhood, family formation, and family stability, including the effects of father absence, single parenting, and policies affecting durable family relationships;</p>
