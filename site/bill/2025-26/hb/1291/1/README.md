## Section 1
1. Except as required in subsection (2) of this section, for a health plan issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, that provides coverage for labor and delivery services, labor and delivery services are not subject to the enrollee's deductible. Any cost sharing for labor and delivery services paid by an enrollee must be applied toward the enrollee's deductible obligation.

2. For a health plan that provides coverage of labor and delivery services and is offered as a qualifying health plan for a health savings account, the health carrier shall establish the plan's deductible for the coverage of the labor and delivery services at the minimum level necessary to preserve the enrollee's ability to claim tax exempt contributions from their health savings account under internal revenue service laws and regulations.
