<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the bigleaf maple is the tallest species of maple in North America, native to the Pacific Northwest, a distinctive and attractive species of tree, and a key part of Washington's forest ecosystems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that bigleaf maple sap can be processed into maple syrup, with significant value added potential. Bigleaf maple syrup has a unique and desirable flavor profile that reflects the nuances of the trees' environment. On average, between 60 and 90 gallons of bigleaf maple sap are required to make one gallon of bigleaf maple syrup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that it is impractical to use a commercial kitchen to process maple syrup. The high volume of sap needed as an input makes it impractical to transport the sap for processing, and the large quantity of steam produced during syrup production can be problematic in a nonspecialized kitchen. For these reasons, maple syrup production is typically done in an on-site, specialized facility known as a sugar shack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that much of Washington's forestland well-suited to commercial sugaring is located in remote areas that lack utilities such as water, sewer, septic, and electrical systems and are not well-suited to the requirements of the food processor license.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that the United States food and drug administration considers the process of making maple syrup to be low risk. Maple syrup must be extensively boiled and is bottled at temperatures between 180 and 200 degrees, inherently controlling foodborne pathogens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is, therefore, the intent of the legislature to create a maple syrup processing license that responds to maple syrup's unique production circumstances, supports the production of this unique regional commodity, and provides an economic incentive for leaving land forested.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Director&quot; means the director of the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Maple sap&quot; means the sap or sweet water obtained by tapping a maple tree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Maple syrup&quot; means syrup made exclusively by the evaporation of pure maple sap. This does not include value added products such as flavored syrup, maple candies, bottling other businesses' syrup, known as co-manufacturing, or the processing of other food products where maple syrup is an added ingredient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Maple syrup processing operation&quot; means a person or business that produces maple syrup for sale, and includes the collection of maple sap, the processing of maple sap into maple syrup, and all related facilities, equipment, and employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Permeate&quot; means the clean water that is produced during the reverse osmosis process and that may be taken directly from the evaporator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Sugar shack&quot; means a structure used, in whole or in part, for the collection, storage, or processing of maple sap into maple syrup. A sugar shack does not include a domestic residence. A sugar shack need not be a permanent structure, but the permittee must be able to ensure sanitary conditions in the processing area.</p>
</li>

<p>All maple syrup processing operations must be permitted every two years by the department on forms developed by the department. All permits and permit renewals must be made on forms developed by the department and be accompanied by a fee of $250. All fees must be deposited into the food processing inspection account created in RCW 69.07.120.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the provision of any information required by the department on forms developed under subsection (1) of this section and the payment of all fees, an applicant for a permit or a permit renewal as a maple syrup processing operation must also provide documentation that all individuals involved in the preparation of maple syrup have secured appropriate food safety training, which will include a food and beverage service worker's permit under chapter 69.06 RCW or its equivalent.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The maple syrup processing operation must meet appropriate sanitation controls determined by the department both before initial permitting and thereafter at a frequency designated for low-risk food products by the department. In addition, the department may inspect the sugar shack and maple syrup processing operation at any time in response to a food complaint, foodborne outbreak, or other public health emergency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When conducting the sanitary inspection, the department shall, at a minimum, inspect for the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>That the permitted maple syrup processor understands that no person other than the permittee, or a person under the direct supervision of the permittee, may be engaged in the processing, packaging, or handling of maple syrup;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That all food contact surfaces, equipment, and utensils used for the preparation, packaging, or handling of maple sap or maple syrup are appropriately cleaned and sanitized as frequently as necessary;</p>

<p>That all food preparation and food and equipment storage areas are maintained free of contamination sources, including rodents and insects;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That all persons involved in the preparation and packaging of maple syrup:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Have obtained, at a minimum, a food and beverage service worker's permit under chapter 69.06 RCW or its equivalent;</p>
</li>
