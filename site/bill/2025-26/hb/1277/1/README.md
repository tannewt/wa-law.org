## Section 3
This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preference contained in sections 1 and 2, chapter . . ., Laws of 2025 (sections 1 and 2 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.

1. The legislature categorizes this tax preference as one intended to provide tax relief for certain businesses or individuals, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(e).

2. It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to reduce the sales and use tax burden on critical access hospitals located on an island by eliminating the payment of tax on the purchase of medical equipment and supplies used by the hospital.

3. If a review finds the actual fiscal cost of this tax preference has not exceeded the estimated cost in the fiscal note by more than five percent in any of the initial three biennia, then the legislature intends to extend the expiration date of the tax preference.

4. In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (3) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may refer to any data and relevant taxpayer information collected by the state.
