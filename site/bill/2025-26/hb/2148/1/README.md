Participants shall sign a binding contract to make contributions to the pay it forward program beginning one year following graduation or discontinuation of their graduate degree program.

    a. Provide funds to participants for tuition and fees, less any awards received through state financial aid;

    b. Deposit participant contributions into the pay it forward trust fund account created in section 3 of this act. In determining the amount and length of time participants contribute to the program, the council shall apply the following criteria:

        i. Participants who attended a state university may not be required to contribute more than five percent of their income;

        ii. Participants who attended a regional university or state college may not be required to contribute more than 3.5 percent of their income;

## Section 3

The account shall consist of funds appropriated by the legislature for the program, contributions to the pay it forward program by participants, and private contributions, including principal and interest.

Both during and after the fiscal period in which moneys were deposited in the account, the council may expend moneys in the account only for the purposes of the pay it forward program.

3. Expenditures from the account shall be used for the pay it forward program according to program rules and policies.

4. Only the executive director of the council or the executive director's designee may authorize expenditures from the account.
