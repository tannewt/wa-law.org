The medical coverage decisions of the department do not constitute a &quot;rule&quot; as used in RCW 34.05.010(16), nor are such decisions subject to the rule‑making provisions of chapter 34.05 RCW except that criteria for establishing medical coverage decisions shall be adopted by rule. The department may recommend to a victim particular health care services and providers where specialized treatment is indicated or where cost-effective payment levels or rates are obtained by the department, and the department may enter into contracts for goods and services including, but not limited to, durable medical equipment so long as statewide access to quality service is maintained for injured victims;</p>

The department shall coordinate with other state purchasers of health care services to establish as much consistency and uniformity in billing and coding practices as possible, taking into account the unique requirements and differences between programs. No service covered under this title, including services provided to victims, whether noncitizens or other victims, who are not residing in the United States at the time of receiving the services, shall be charged or paid at a rate or rates exceeding those specified in such fee schedule, and no contract providing for greater fees shall be valid as to the excess. The establishment of such a schedule, exclusive of conversion factors, does not constitute &quot;agency action&quot; as used in RCW 34.05.010(3), nor does such a fee schedule constitute a &quot;rule&quot; as used in RCW 34.05.010(16).

If sufficient funding is not provided to continue payments to not less than payments provided for comparable services under the workers' compensation program, the director shall reduce the payments under the fee schedule for the following fiscal year based on caseload estimates and available funding, except payments may not be reduced to less than seventy percent of payments for comparable services under the workers' compensation program;</p>

<li>
<p>If an unforeseeable catastrophic event results in insufficient funding to continue payments to not less than payments provided for comparable services under the workers' compensation program, the director shall reduce the payments under the fee schedule to not less than seventy percent of payments provided for comparable services under the workers' compensation program, provided that the reduction may not be more than necessary to fund benefits under the program; and</p>

<li>
<p>Once sufficient funding is provided or otherwise available, the director shall increase the payments under the fee schedule to not less than payments provided for comparable services under the workers' compensation program;</p>

<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>

<p>In order to adequately prepare our youth for their meaningful participation in our democratic institutions and processes, there must be strong educational resources aimed at teaching students and the public about the fragile nature of our constitutional rights.</p>
</li>

<p>The federal commission on wartime relocation and internment of civilians was established by congress in 1980 to review the facts and circumstances surrounding executive order 9066, issued on February 19, 1942, and the impact of the executive order on American citizens and permanent residents, and to recommend appropriate remedies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The commission on wartime relocation and internment of civilians issued a report of its findings in 1983 with the reports &quot;Personal Justice Denied&quot; and &quot;Personal Justice Denied-Part II, Recommendations.&quot; The reports were based on information gathered through twenty days of hearings in cities across the country, particularly the west coast. Testimony was heard from more than seven hundred fifty witnesses, including evacuees, former government officials, public figures, interested citizens, historians, and other professionals who have studied the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>The lessons to be learned from the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II are embodied in &quot;Personal Justice Denied-Part II, Recommendations&quot; which found that executive order 9066 was not justified by military necessity, and the decisions that followed from it were not founded upon military considerations. These decisions included the exclusion and detention of American citizens and resident noncitizens of Japanese descent. The broad historical causes that shaped these decisions were race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership. Widespread ignorance about Americans of Japanese descent contributed to a policy conceived in haste and executed in an atmosphere of fear and anger at Japan. A grave personal injustice was done to the American citizens and resident noncitizens of Japanese ancestry who, without individual review or any probative evidence against them were excluded, removed, and detained by the United States during World War II.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A grave injustice was done to both citizens and permanent residents of Japanese ancestry by the evacuation, relocation, and internment of civilians during World War II. These actions were carried out without adequate security reasons and without any documented acts of espionage or sabotage, and were motivated largely by racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political leadership. The excluded individuals of Japanese ancestry suffered enormous damages, both material and intangible, and there were incalculable losses in education and job training, all of which resulted in significant human suffering for which appropriate compensation has not been made. For these fundamental violations of the basic civil liberties and constitutional rights of these individuals of Japanese ancestry, the United States congress apologized on behalf of the nation in the federal civil liberties act of 1988.</p>

<li>
<p>The department is responsible for determining eligibility for referral for essential needs and housing support under RCW 43.185C.220. Persons eligible for a referral are persons who:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Have been determined to be eligible for the aged, blind, or disabled assistance program under RCW 74.62.030 or the pregnant women assistance program under RCW 74.62.030, or are incapacitated from gainful employment by reason of bodily or mental infirmity that will likely continue for a minimum of 90 days. The standard for incapacity in this subsection, as evidenced by the 90-day duration standard, is not intended to be as stringent as federal supplemental security income disability standards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are citizens or noncitizens lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise residing in the United States under color of law, or are victims of human trafficking as defined in RCW 74.04.005;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Have furnished the department with their social security number. If the social security number cannot be furnished because it has not been issued or is not known, an application for a number must be made prior to authorization of benefits, and the social security number must be provided to the department upon receipt;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This requirement does not apply to victims of human trafficking as defined in RCW 74.04.005 if they have not been issued a social security number;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Have countable income as described in RCW 74.04.005 that meets the standard established by the department, which shall not exceed 100 percent of the federal poverty level; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have income that meets the standard established by the department, who are eligible for the pregnant women assistance program;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not have countable resources in excess of those described in RCW 74.04.005; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are not eligible for federal aid assistance, other than basic food benefits transferred electronically and medical assistance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recipients of pregnant women assistance program benefits who meet other eligibility requirements in this section are eligible for referral for essential needs and housing support services, within funds appropriated for the department of commerce, for 24 consecutive months from the date the department determines pregnant women assistance program eligibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following persons are not eligible for a referral for essential needs and housing support:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Persons who refuse or fail to cooperate in obtaining federal aid assistance, without good cause;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persons who refuse or fail without good cause to participate in substance use treatment if an assessment by a certified substance use disorder professional indicates a need for such treatment. Good cause must be found to exist when a person's physical or mental condition, as determined by the department, prevents the person from participating in substance use treatment, when needed outpatient treatment is not available to the person in the county of their residence, when needed inpatient treatment is not available in a location that is reasonably accessible for the person, or when the person is a parent or other relative personally providing care for a minor child or an incapacitated individual living in the same home as the person, and child care or day care would be necessary for the person to participate in substance use disorder treatment, and such care is not available; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persons who are fleeing to avoid prosecution of, or to avoid custody or confinement for conviction of, a felony, or an attempt to commit a felony, under the laws of the state of Washington or the place from which the person flees; or who are violating a condition of probation, community supervision, or parole imposed under federal or state law for a felony or gross misdemeanor conviction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of determining whether a person is incapacitated from gainful employment under subsection (1) of this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The department shall adopt by rule medical criteria for incapacity determinations to ensure that eligibility decisions are consistent with statutory requirements and are based on clear, objective medical information; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process implementing the medical criteria must involve consideration of opinions of the treating or consulting physicians or health care professionals regarding incapacity, and any eligibility decision which rejects uncontroverted medical opinion must set forth clear and convincing reasons for doing so.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of reviewing a person's continuing eligibility and in order to remain eligible for the program, persons who have been found to have an incapacity from gainful employment must demonstrate that there has been no material improvement in their medical or mental health condition. The department may discontinue benefits when there was specific error in the prior determination that found the person eligible by reason of incapacitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must review the cases of all persons who have received benefits under the essential needs and housing support program for twelve consecutive months, and at least annually after the first review, to determine whether they are eligible for the aged, blind, or disabled assistance program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall share client data for individuals eligible for essential needs and housing support with the department of commerce and designated essential needs and housing support entities as required under RCW 43.185C.230.</p>

<li>
<p>An agency may file notice for the expedited adoption of rules in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section for rules meeting any one of the following criteria:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The proposed rules relate only to internal governmental operations that are not subject to violation by a person;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proposed rules adopt or incorporate by reference without material change federal statutes or regulations, Washington state statutes, rules of other Washington state agencies, shoreline master programs other than those programs governing shorelines of statewide significance, or, as referenced by Washington state law, national consensus codes that generally establish industry standards, if the material adopted or incorporated regulates the same subject matter and conduct as the adopting or incorporating rule;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proposed rules only correct typographical errors, make address or name changes, or clarify language of a rule without changing its effect, including a proposed rule described in subsection (9) of this section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The content of the proposed rules is explicitly and specifically dictated by statute;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proposed rules have been the subject of negotiated rule making, pilot rule making, or some other process that involved substantial participation by interested parties before the development of the proposed rule; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proposed rule is being amended after a review under RCW 34.05.328.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An agency may file notice for the expedited repeal of rules under the procedures set forth in this section for rules meeting any one of the following criteria:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The statute on which the rule is based has been repealed and has not been replaced by another statute providing statutory authority for the rule;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The statute on which the rule is based has been declared unconstitutional by a court with jurisdiction, there is a final judgment, and no statute has been enacted to replace the unconstitutional statute;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rule is no longer necessary because of changed circumstances; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other rules of the agency or of another agency govern the same activity as the rule, making the rule redundant.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The expedited rule-making process must follow the requirements for rule making set forth in RCW 34.05.320, except that the agency is not required to prepare a small business economic impact statement under RCW 19.85.025, a statement indicating whether the rule constitutes a significant legislative rule under RCW 34.05.328(5)(c)(iii), or a significant legislative rule analysis under RCW 34.05.328. An agency is not required to prepare statements of inquiry under RCW 34.05.310 or conduct a hearing for the expedited rule making. The notice for the expedited rule making must contain a statement in at least ten-point type, that is substantially in the following form:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>THIS RULE IS BEING PROPOSED UNDER AN EXPEDITED RULE-MAKING PROCESS THAT WILL ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR THE AGENCY TO HOLD PUBLIC HEARINGS, PREPARE A SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT, OR PROVIDE RESPONSES TO THE CRITERIA FOR A SIGNIFICANT LEGISLATIVE RULE. IF YOU OBJECT TO THIS USE OF THE EXPEDITED RULE-MAKING PROCESS, YOU MUST EXPRESS YOUR OBJECTIONS IN WRITING AND THEY MUST BE SENT TO (INSERT NAME AND ADDRESS) AND RECEIVED BY (INSERT DATE).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>The agency shall send either a copy of the notice of the proposed expedited rule making, or a summary of the information on the notice, to any person who has requested notification of proposals for expedited rule making or of regular agency rule making, as well as the joint administrative rules review committee, within three days after its publication in the Washington State Register. An agency may charge for the actual cost of providing a requesting party mailed copies of these notices. The notice of the proposed expedited rule making must be preceded by a statement substantially in the form provided in subsection (3) of this section. The notice must also include an explanation of the reasons the agency believes the expedited rule-making process is appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code reviser shall publish the text of all rules proposed for expedited adoption, and the citation and caption of all rules proposed for expedited repeal, along with the notice required in this section in a separate section of the Washington State Register. Once the notice of expedited rule making has been published in the Washington State Register, the only changes that an agency may make in the noticed materials before their final adoption or repeal are to correct typographical errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any person may file a written objection to the expedited rule making. The objection must be filed with the agency rules coordinator within forty-five days after the notice of the proposed expedited rule making has been published in the Washington State Register. A person who has filed a written objection to the expedited rule making may withdraw the objection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (9) of this section, if no written objections to the expedited rule making are filed with the agency within forty-five days after the notice of proposed expedited rule making is published, or if all objections that have been filed are withdrawn by the persons filing the objections, the agency may enter an order adopting or repealing the rule without further notice or a public hearing. The order must be published in the manner required by this chapter for any other agency order adopting, amending, or repealing a rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (9) of this section, if a written notice of objection to the expedited rule making is timely filed with the agency and is not withdrawn, the notice of proposed expedited rule making published under this section is considered a statement of inquiry for the purposes of RCW 34.05.310, and the agency may initiate further rule-making proceedings in accordance with this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proposed rules which may be filed under subsection (1)(d) of this section include any proposed rule which, pursuant to RCW 1.20.130(2), only substitutes the term &quot;alien,&quot; when used to refer to an individual who is not a citizen or national of the United States, with the term &quot;noncitizen&quot; or other context-appropriate term and which makes necessary grammatical changes and definitions resulting from the substitution, but does not change the effect of a rule. Written objections to a proposed rule meeting the criteria in this subsection may be filed as described in subsection (6) of this section, however an agency may proceed with entering an order under subsection (7) of this section notwithstanding objections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As used in this section, &quot;expedited rule making&quot; includes both the expedited adoption of rules and the expedited repeal of rules.</p>
</li>
