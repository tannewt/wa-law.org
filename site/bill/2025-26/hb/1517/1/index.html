<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the Washington state digital equity plan documents the findings in this section.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that many Washingtonians do not have access to adequate and affordable internet or internet-connected devices, making them unable to participate fully online. The legislature finds that connectivity to the internet enables residents to access school, work, job training, elder care and connections, faith programs, health care, farming resources, civic participation, and much more. The legislature finds that this digital inequity affects communities all over the state, including frontier, rural, urban, and suburban areas, and tribal lands.</p>
<p>The legislature reaffirms the findings in section 102, chapter 265, Laws of 2022, which state: &quot;Access to the internet is essential to participating in modern day society including, but not limited to, attending school and work, accessing health care, paying for basic services, connecting with family and friends, civic participation, and economic survival.&quot;</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that state agencies need funding to adapt their programs to include digital access and adoption. The legislature further finds that there is a need to fund community-based organizations and build public-private partnerships to reach customers who qualify for subsidies and digital skill building.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that barriers to digital equity stem from a range of systemic barriers that prevent certain populations from accessing and benefiting from digital technologies, including: Infrastructure gaps, broadband access, digital literacy, access to devices, transportation and housing, or personal challenges like limited English proficiency, disabilities, age, or social-economic position. These systemic and personal barriers should not limit access and opportunities to participate in our digital society.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that the aging population, projected to reach 27 percent by 2040, faces significant digital connectivity challenges, with 41 percent of those over 65 not using the internet and 53 percent lacking broadband access. Reliable internet is essential for older adults to access telehealth services and maintain their independence, underscoring the critical role of digital connectivity in their health and wellness.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that Washington is home to approximately 530,000 veterans, 62,000 active-duty military personnel, 18,000 national guard and reserve members, and 2,000,000 family members. Veterans without internet access are generally older, unmarried, have lower educational attainment, and earn less than those with access. Reliable internet is crucial for these individuals to access health care, benefits, and other essential resources.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that approximately 26.5 percent of Washington residents live in rural areas, facing challenges such as limited health care, education, and job opportunities, along with inadequate infrastructure. Addressing digital inequities in these areas requires investment in broadband infrastructure, internet affordability, and digital skills training.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that low literacy rates, affecting 16.1 percent of the population, and language barriers further complicate digital inclusion, particularly for the 1,130,000 residents born outside the United States, of whom 42 percent have limited English proficiency. Even among the nearly 560,000 naturalized citizens, 35 percent reported limited English proficiency, highlighting the need for accessible digital resources.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that approximately 10 percent of Washington residents lived below the poverty line in 2020, with notable disparities among children and Hispanic and Latinx communities. High-speed internet access is critical for low-income households to access educational programs, job opportunities, and financial assistance, thus promoting social and economic equity.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes the need to support Washington's statewide cybersecurity strategy to protect data and privacy of individuals sharing one or more of the following characteristics: Individuals who live in covered households, individuals aged 60 and over, incarcerated individuals, other than individuals who are incarcerated in a federal correctional facility, veterans, individuals with disabilities, individuals belonging to a racial and ethnic minority, individuals living in rural areas, individuals with a language barrier, children and youth in foster care, and individuals experiencing housing instability.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes the need to leverage existing workforce programs and expand community partnerships that provide increased knowledge and skills enabling populations to participate in changing workforce opportunities.</p>
