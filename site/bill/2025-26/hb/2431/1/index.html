<p>In order to qualify for an exemption under this chapter, the nonprofit organizations, associations, or corporations must satisfy the conditions in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The property must be used exclusively for the actual operation of the activity for which exemption is granted, unless otherwise provided, and does not exceed an amount reasonably necessary for that purpose. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The loan or rental of the property does not subject the property to tax if:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The rents and donations received for the use of the portion of the property are reasonable and do not exceed the maintenance and operation expenses attributable to the portion of the property loaned or rented;</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>An inadvertent use of the property in a manner inconsistent with the purpose for which exemption is granted does not subject the property to tax, if the inadvertent use is not part of a pattern of use. A pattern of use is presumed when an inadvertent use is repeated in the same assessment year or in two or more successive assessment years.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The facilities and services must be available to all regardless of race, color, national origin or ancestry.</p>
