# HB 2034 - LEOFF 1 restatement

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2034-S2.pdf)

## Section 101
The legislature finds that plan 1 of the Washington law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system (LEOFF plan 1) has been closed to new members for nearly a quarter of a century and is now comprised almost entirely of retirees and survivor beneficiaries. Similarly, employers and employees have made no contributions to the plan for nearly a quarter of a century, and over the life of the plan, over 80 percent of all funds contributed have been from the state through general fund—state appropriations.

As of January 2026, only six active members remain in the plan, as compared to 6,000 annuitants. LEOFF plan 1 has far exceeded full funding and has assets which exceed all projected future liabilities, has a surplus of more than $3,300,000,000 today, and no significant amount of additional benefits can be earned in the plan. By the date most of this act is effective, June 30, 2029, LEOFF plan 1 is projected to reach more than 200 percent of full funding.

The supreme court of the state of Washington, in the 1972 decision Weaver v. Evans, established that the firefighters and police officers, active and retired, have a constitutionally protected contractual right to a secure retirement benefit, funded on a systematic basis. The legislature recognizes that the state of Washington is the ultimate guarantor of the LEOFF plan 1 retirement benefits. While members have a constitutionally protected right to the pension benefits that are provided as part of their contract of employment, individual members and beneficiaries do not have a right to any surplus assets of the retirement plan once there has been a complete satisfaction of all liabilities under the plan.

As the plan sponsor, the state retains the inherent power to terminate a retirement plan and, upon the satisfaction of all liabilities under the plan, is entitled to a reversion of the surplus assets. The restatement of LEOFF plan 1 shall include the transfer of actuarially sufficient resources to ensure the satisfaction of all liabilities under LEOFF plan 1.

The legislature has determined that, in order to accomplish the foregoing goals and objectives, it is in the best interest of the members and beneficiaries of LEOFF plan 1 that the plan be terminated and that a restated retirement plan created. Recognizing that the assets of LEOFF plan 1 are intended for the exclusive benefit of the plan's members and beneficiaries, only after actuarially sufficient assets have been transferred to the restated law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system shall there be a reversion of any surplus assets to the state in the interest of the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the state.

It is the intent of the legislature that the LEOFF plan 1 restatement and termination be performed in accordance with the provisions of the federal internal revenue code that apply to state government pension plans and in recognition of the contract rights of the members and beneficiaries of the plan to an actuarially sound retirement program. Between the enactment of this law and the restatement and termination of LEOFF plan 1, the legislature intends to make any changes necessary to conform with federal requirements following receipt of formal guidance from the federal internal revenue service.

## Section 102
Plan 1 of the Washington law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system (LEOFF plan 1) is restated, and hereby terminated, effective June 30, 2029. During the transition between the restatement and termination of LEOFF plan 1 and the establishment of the restated law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system, all LEOFF plan 1 benefits, as they existed prior to termination and restatement, shall continue without interruption.

## Section 103
The restated law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system is hereby established as provided in this chapter. The restated law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system established by this chapter may also be referred to by statute and rule as the law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system plan 1. The restated law enforcement plan does not create benefits for members and beneficiaries different than, nor in addition to, those that existed prior to restatement and termination, with the exception of vesting benefits for nonvested members upon the creation of the restated plan in section 318 of this act.

## Section 104
1. The restated law enforcement officers' and firefighters' defined benefit retirement fund is created in the custody of the state treasurer. The fund shall consist of assets transferred from the Washington law enforcement officers' and firefighters' system plan 1 retirement fund, investment earnings, and other amounts deposited to the fund. At direction of the director of retirement systems, the state treasurer shall transfer to the restated law enforcement officers' and firefighters' defined benefit retirement fund an amount equal to 110 percent of the actuarial present value of the fully projected benefits of plan 1 of the Washington law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system. On direction of the director of retirement systems, the state treasurer shall transfer this amount through a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer, to the restated law enforcement officers' and firefighters' defined benefit retirement fund. The state actuary must determine the actuarial present value of fully projected benefits of plan 1 of the Washington law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system as of June 30, 2029, using the latest actuarial valuation available at the time of determination.

2. The pension funding council shall conduct an independent audit of the calculation of the present value amount determined by the state actuary. The transfer of these assets to the restated law enforcement officers' and firefighters' defined benefit retirement fund shall occur on the effective date of this section. From the remaining assets in the Washington law enforcement officers' and firefighters' system plan 1 retirement fund, $569,000,000 shall be deposited in the climate commitment account, and the remainder shall be deposited in the pension funding stabilization account and continue to be invested by the state investment board until otherwise directed by law.

3. Expenditures from the restated law enforcement officers' and firefighters' defined benefit retirement fund may be used only for the purposes of this chapter. Only the director of retirement systems or the director's designee may authorize expenditures from the fund. No appropriation is required for expenditures.

4. The director of retirement systems may direct the state treasurer, subsequent to the transfer of assets under sections 101 through 105 of this act, to make such additional transfers as are necessary to reconcile the amounts transferred and the requirements of sections 101 through 105 of this act.

## Section 105
1. The state investment board has the full power to invest, reinvest, manage, contract, sell, or exchange investment money in (a) the restated law enforcement officers' and firefighters' defined benefit retirement fund and (b) the pension funding stabilization account. All investment and operating costs of the state investment board and the state treasurer associated with these funds shall be paid under RCW 43.08.190, 43.33A.160, 43.79A.040, and 43.84.160. With the exception of these expenses, the earnings from the investment of the funds shall be retained by the funds.

2. All investments made by the state investment board shall be made with the exercise of that degree of judgment and care under RCW 43.33A.140 and the investment policy established by the state investment board.

3. As deemed appropriate by the state investment board, money in the funds may be commingled for investment with other qualified or eligible funds under the investment authority of the board.

## Section 106
The legislature reserves the right to make such amendments and modifications as may be necessary in the future to accomplish the goals of sections 101 through 107 of this act, without any diminution of the rights and benefits of the LEOFF plan 1 members, retirees, and surviving spouses, as they existed prior to the effective date of this section.

## Section 107
Any claim filed challenging the validity of sections 101 through 107 of this act not filed before December 31, 2027, is forever barred, if not already barred by an otherwise applicable statute of limitations. As an urgent issue of broad public importance that requires prompt and ultimate determination, any such claim is subject to direct review by the supreme court of Washington. By the effective date of this section, the department of retirement systems shall send notification of the provisions of this act and specifically of the limitations of this section, by first-class mail, to the last known address of each plan 1 active member, retiree, and spousal survivor.

## Section 108
The department of retirement systems, following the obligation to administer the retirement plans consistent with the requirements of the federal internal revenue code, shall seek appropriate guidance to ensure the continuous compliance of the LEOFF plan 1 and the restated law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system. In the event that the federal internal revenue service formally concludes that legislative changes are needed for the orderly restatement and termination of the LEOFF plan 1 by June 30, 2029, those findings and recommendations for responding to those findings shall be promptly submitted to the governor and the appropriate committees of the house of representatives and the senate. In the event that any funds have been reverted to the state, and to comply with federal internal revenue service requirements they must be reverted back to the plan, those funds must be reverted back with interest, as determined by the director of the department of retirement systems.

For the purpose of such computations, the employee's creditability of service and eligibility for service or disability retirement and survivor and all other benefits shall continue to be as provided in such prior retirement act, as if transfer of membership had not occurred. The excess, if any, of the benefits so computed, giving full value to survivor benefits, over the benefits payable under this chapter shall be paid whether or not the employee has made application under the prior act. If the employee's prior retirement system was the Washington public employees' retirement system, payment of such excess shall be made by that system; if the employee's prior retirement system was the statewide city employees' retirement system, payment of such excess shall be made by the employer which was the member's employer when his or her transfer of membership occurred: PROVIDED, That any death in line of duty lump sum benefit payment shall continue to be the obligation of that system as provided in RCW 41.44.210; in the case of all other prior retirement systems, payment of such excess shall be made by the employer which was the member's employer when his or her transfer of membership occurred.

The obligations of chapter 41.20 RCW shall continue to be paid from whatever financial sources the city has been using for this purpose.

## Section 307
By July 31, 1971, the director of retirement systems shall adopt minimum medical and health standards for membership coverage into the Washington law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system. In adopting such standards the director of retirement systems shall consider existing standards recommended by the international association of chiefs of police and the international association of firefighters, and shall adopt equal or higher standards, together with appropriate standards and procedures to ensure uniform compliance with this chapter. The standards when adopted shall be published and distributed to each employer, and each employer shall adopt certification procedures and such other procedures as are required to ensure that no law enforcement officer or firefighter receives membership coverage unless and until he or she has actually met minimum medical and health standards: PROVIDED, That an elected sheriff or an appointed chief of police, fire chief, or director of public safety shall not be required to meet the age standard. The director of retirement systems may amend the minimum medical and health standards as experience indicates, even if the standards as so amended are lower or less rigid than those recommended by the international associations mentioned above. The cost of the medical examination contemplated by this section is to be paid by the employer.

## Section 308
Nothing in sections 304, 306, and 307 of this act shall apply to any firefighters or law enforcement officers who are employed as such on or before August 1, 1971, as long as they continue in such employment; nor to promotional appointments after becoming a member in the police or fire department of any employer nor to the reemployment of a law enforcement officer or firefighter by the same or a different employer within six months after the termination of his or her employment, nor to the reinstatement of a law enforcement officer or firefighter who has been on military or disability leave, disability retirement status, or leave of absence status.

Retirement benefits shall be suspended during the period of his or her return to service and he or she shall make contributions and receive service credit. Such a member shall have the right to again retire at any time and his or her retirement allowance shall be recomputed, and paid, based upon additional service rendered and any change in final average salary.

All firefighters and law enforcement officers employed by or retired from the city are eligible for election. Each of the elected members shall serve a two year term. If there are either no firefighters or law enforcement officers under the jurisdiction of the board eligible to vote, a second eligible employee representative shall be elected by the law enforcement officers or firefighters eligible to vote.

    c. Each county shall establish a disability board having jurisdiction over all members employed by or retired from an employer within the county and not employed by a city in which a disability board is established. The county disability board so created shall be composed of five members to be chosen as follows: One member of the legislative body of the county to be appointed by the county legislative body; one member of a city or town legislative body located within the county which does not contain a city disability board established pursuant to (a) of this subsection to be chosen by a majority of the mayors of such cities and towns within the county which does not contain a city disability board; one active firefighter or retired firefighter employed by or retired from an employer within the county to be elected by the firefighters employed or retired from an employer within the county who are subject to the jurisdiction of that board; one law enforcement officer or retired law enforcement officer employed by or retired from an employer within the county to be elected by the law enforcement officers employed in or retired from an employer within the county who are subject to the jurisdiction of that board; and one member from the public at large who resides within the county but does not reside within a city in which a city disability board is established, to be appointed by the other four members designated in this subsection.

        ii. The surviving spouse or domestic partner of a firefighter or law enforcement officer subject to the jurisdiction of the board.

2. The members of both the county and city disability boards shall not receive compensation for their service upon the boards but the members shall be reimbursed by their respective county or city for all expenses incidental to such service as to the amount authorized by law.

Any member, regardless of age or years of service may be retired by the disability board, subject to approval by the director, for any disability incurred in the line of duty which has been continuous since his or her discontinuance of service and which renders the member unable to continue service. No disability retirement allowance shall be paid until the expiration of a period of six months after the discontinuance of service during which period the member, if found to be physically or mentally unfit for duty by the disability board following receipt of his or her application for disability retirement, shall be granted a disability leave by the disability board and shall receive an allowance equal to the full monthly salary and shall continue to receive all other benefits provided to active employees from the employer for such period.

Whenever any active member, or any member hereafter retired, on account of service, sickness, or disability, not caused or brought on by dissipation or abuse, of which the disability board shall be judge, is confined in any hospital or in home, and whether or not so confined, requires medical services, the employer shall pay for the active or retired member the necessary medical services not payable from some other source as provided for in subsection (2) of this section. In the case of active or retired firefighters the employer may make the payments provided for in this section from the firefighters' pension fund established pursuant to RCW 41.16.050 where the fund had been established prior to March 1, 1970.

Failure to apply for coverage if otherwise eligible under the provisions of Public Law 8997 shall not be deemed a refusal of payment of benefits thereby enabling collection of charges under the provisions of this chapter.

3. Upon making the payments provided for in subsection (1) of this section, the employer shall be subrogated to all rights of the member against any third party who may be held liable for the member's injuries or for payment of the cost of medical services in connection with a member's sickness or disability to the extent necessary to recover the amount of payments made by the employer.

4. Any employer under this chapter, either singly, or jointly with any other such employer or employers through an association thereof as provided for in chapter 48.21 RCW, may provide for all or part of one or more plans of group hospitalization and medical aid insurance to cover any of its employees who are members of the restated law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system, and/or retired former employees who were, before retirement, members of the retirement system, through contracts with regularly constituted insurance carriers, with health maintenance organizations as defined in chapter 48.46 RCW, or with health care service contractors as defined in chapter 48.44 RCW. Benefits payable under the plan or plans shall be deemed to be amounts received or eligible to be received by the active or retired member under subsection (2) of this section.

Sec. 522(b)(2), the exemptions in this section relating to retirement benefits are provided.

2. Unless otherwise provided by federal law, any money received by any citizen of the state of Washington as a pension from the government of the United States, whether the same be in the actual possession of such person or be deposited or loaned, shall be exempt from execution, attachment, garnishment, or seizure by or under any legal process whatever, and when a debtor dies, or absconds, and leaves his or her family any money exempted by this subsection, the same shall be exempt to the family as provided in this subsection. This subsection shall not apply to child support collection actions issued under chapter 26.18, 26.23, or 74.20A RCW, if otherwise permitted by federal law.

3. The right of a person to a pension, annuity, or retirement allowance or disability allowance, or death benefits, or any optional benefit, or any other right accrued or accruing to any citizen of the state of Washington under any employee benefit plan, and any fund created by such a plan or arrangement, shall be exempt from execution, attachment, garnishment, or seizure by or under any legal process whatever. This subsection shall not apply to child support collection actions issued under chapter 26.18, 26.23, or 74.20A RCW if otherwise permitted by federal law. This subsection shall permit benefits under any such plan or arrangement to be payable to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant in such plan to the extent expressly provided for in a qualified domestic relations order that meets the requirements for such orders under the plan, or, in the case of benefits payable under a plan described in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 403(b) or 408 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, or section 409 of such code as in effect before January 1, 1984, to the extent provided in any order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction that provides for maintenance or support. This subsection does not prohibit actions against an employee benefit plan, or fund for valid obligations incurred by the plan or fund for the benefit of the plan or fund.

4. For the purposes of this section, the term "employee benefit plan" means any plan or arrangement that is described in RCW 49.64.020, including any Keogh plan, whether funded by a trust or by an annuity contract, and in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 401(a) or 403(a) of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended; or that is a tax-sheltered annuity or a custodial account described in section 403(b) of such code or an individual retirement account or an individual retirement annuity described in section 408 of such code; or a Roth individual retirement account described in section 408A of such code; or a medical savings account or a health savings account described in sections 220 and 223, respectively, of such code; or a retirement bond described in section 409 of such code as in effect before January 1, 1984. The term "employee benefit plan" shall not include any employee benefit plan that is established or maintained for its employees by the government of the United States, by the state of Washington under chapter 2.10, 2.12, 41.26, 41.--- (the new chapter created in section 504 of this act), 41.32, 41.34, 41.35, 41.37, 41.40, or 43.43 RCW or RCW 41.50.770, or by any agency or instrumentality of the government of the United States.

5. An employee benefit plan shall be deemed to be a spendthrift trust, regardless of the source of funds, the relationship between the trustee or custodian of the plan and the beneficiary, or the ability of the debtor to withdraw or borrow or otherwise become entitled to benefits from the plan before retirement. This subsection shall not apply to child support collection actions issued under chapter 26.18, 26.23, or 74.20A RCW, if otherwise permitted by federal law. This subsection shall permit benefits under any such plan or arrangement to be payable to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant in such plan to the extent expressly provided for in a qualified domestic relations order that meets the requirements for such orders under the plan, or, in the case of benefits payable under a plan described in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 403(b) or 408 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, or section 409 of such code as in effect before January 1, 1984, to the extent provided in any order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction that provides for maintenance or support.

6. Unless prohibited by federal law, nothing contained in subsection (3), (4), or (5) of this section shall be construed as a termination or limitation of a spouse's community property interest in an employee benefit plan held in the name of or on account of the other spouse, who is the participant or the account holder spouse. Unless prohibited by applicable federal law, at the death of the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse, the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse may transfer or distribute the community property interest of the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse in the participant or account holder spouse's employee benefit plan to the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse's estate, testamentary trust, inter vivos trust, or other successor or successors pursuant to the last will of the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse or the law of intestate succession, and that distributee may, but shall not be required to, obtain an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, including a nonjudicial binding agreement or order entered under chapter 11.96A RCW, to confirm the distribution. For purposes of subsection (3) of this section, the distributee of the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse's community property interest in an employee benefit plan shall be considered a person entitled to the full protection of subsection (3) of this section. The nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse's consent to a beneficiary designation by the participant or account holder spouse with respect to an employee benefit plan shall not, absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, be deemed a release, gift, relinquishment, termination, limitation, or transfer of the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse's community property interest in an employee benefit plan. For purposes of this subsection, the term "nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse" means the spouse of the person who is a participant in an employee benefit plan or in whose name an individual retirement account is maintained. As used in this subsection, an order of a court of competent jurisdiction entered under chapter 11.96A RCW includes an agreement, as that term is used under RCW 11.96A.220.

## Section 403
1. Any obligee of a court order or decree establishing a spousal maintenance obligation may seek a mandatory benefits assignment order under chapter 41.50 RCW if any spousal maintenance payment is more than fifteen days past due and the total of such past due payments is equal to or greater than one hundred dollars, or if the obligor requests a withdrawal of accumulated contributions from the department of retirement systems.

2. Any court order or decree establishing a spousal maintenance obligation may state that, if any spousal maintenance payment is more than fifteen days past due and the total of such past due payments is equal to or greater than one hundred dollars, or if the obligor requests a withdrawal of accumulated contributions from the department of retirement systems, the obligee may seek a mandatory benefits assignment order under chapter 41.50 RCW without prior notice to the obligor. Any such court order or decree may also, or in the alternative, contain a provision that would allow the department to make a direct payment of all or part of a withdrawal of accumulated contributions pursuant to RCW 41.50.550(3). Failure to include this provision does not affect the validity of the court order or decree establishing the spousal maintenance, nor does such failure affect the general applicability of RCW 41.50.500 through 41.50.650 to such obligations.

3. The remedies in RCW 41.50.530 through 41.50.630 are the exclusive provisions of law enforceable against the department of retirement systems in connection with any action for enforcement of a spousal maintenance obligation ordered pursuant to a divorce, dissolution, or legal separation, and no other remedy ordered by a court under this chapter shall be enforceable against the department of retirement systems for collection of spousal maintenance.

4. [Empty]

    a. Nothing in this section regarding mandatory assignment of benefits to enforce a spousal maintenance obligation shall abridge the right of an ex spouse to receive direct payment of retirement benefits payable pursuant to: (i) A court decree of dissolution or legal separation; or (ii) any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement; or (iii) incident to any court decree of dissolution or legal separation, if such dissolution orders fully comply with RCW 41.50.670 and 41.50.700, or as applicable, RCW 2.10.180, 2.12.090, 41.04.310, 41.04.320, 41.04.330, 41.26.053, section 310 of this act, 41.32.052, 41.40.052, or 43.43.310 as those statutes existed before July 1, 1987, and as those statutes exist on and after July 28, 1991.

    b. Persons whose dissolution orders as defined in RCW 41.50.500(3) were entered between July 1, 1987, and July 28, 1991, shall be entitled to receive direct payments of retirement benefits to satisfy court-ordered property divisions if the dissolution orders filed with the department comply or are amended to comply with RCW 41.50.670 through 41.50.720 and, as applicable, RCW 2.10.180, 2.12.090, 41.26.053, section 310 of this act, 41.32.052, 41.40.052, or 43.43.310.

The funding process established by this chapter is intended to achieve the following goals:

1. To fully fund the public employees' retirement system plans 2 and 3, the teachers' retirement system plans 2 and 3, the school employees' retirement system plans 2 and 3, the public safety employees' retirement system plan 2, and the law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system plan 2 as provided by law;

To fund any unfunded actuarial accrued liability in the restated law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system with a state contribution based on a systematic actuarial funding policy that would fully amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liability over reasonable periods using reasonable assumptions and methods as determined by the state actuary;

3. To fully amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liability in the public employees' retirement system plan 1 and the teachers' retirement system plan 1 within a rolling ten-year period, using methods and assumptions that balance needs for increased benefit security, decreased contribution rate volatility, and affordability of pension contribution rates, while suspending those rates during the 2025-2027 and 2027-2029 fiscal biennia;

4. To amortize the costs of benefit improvements in the public employees' retirement system plan 1 and the teachers' retirement system plan 1 over a fixed 15-year period;

5. To establish long-term employer contribution rates which will remain a relatively predictable proportion of the future state budgets; and

6. To fund, to the extent feasible, all benefits for plan 2 and 3 members over the working lives of those members so that the cost of those benefits are paid by the taxpayers who receive the benefit of those members' service.

Such agreement may contain such provisions relating to coverage, benefits, contributions, effective date, modification and termination of the agreement, administration, and other appropriate provisions as the governor and secretary of health and human services shall agree upon, but, except as may be otherwise required by or under the social security act as to the services to be covered, such agreement shall provide in effect that:

    a. Benefits will be provided for employees whose services are covered by the agreement (and their dependents and survivors) on the same basis as though such services constituted employment within the meaning of Title II of the social security act;

    b. The state will pay to the secretary of the treasury, at such time or times as may be prescribed under the social security act, contributions with respect to wages (as defined in RCW 41.48.020), equal to the sum of the taxes which would be imposed by the federal insurance contributions act if the services covered by the agreement constituted employment within the meaning of that act;

    c. Such agreement shall be effective with respect to services in employment covered by the agreement or modification thereof performed after a date specified therein but in no event may it be effective with respect to any such services performed prior to the first day of the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which such agreement or modification of the agreement is accepted by the secretary of health and human services;

    d. All services which constitute employment as defined in RCW 41.48.020 and are performed in the employ of the state by employees of the state, shall be covered by the agreement;

4. The governor, before authorizing a referendum, shall require the following conditions to be met:

    a. The referendum shall be by secret written ballot on the question of whether service in positions covered by such retirement system shall be excluded from or included under the agreement between the governor and the secretary of health and human services provided for in subsection (1) of this section;

        ii. Coverage obtained through a divided referendum process shall extend coverage to law enforcement officers, firefighters, and employees of political subdivisions of this state, who have membership in a qualified retirement system, allowing them to obtain medicare coverage only (HI‑only).

    f. The state legislature, in the case of a referendum affecting the rights and liabilities of state employees covered under the state employees' retirement system and employees under the teachers' retirement system, and in all other cases the local legislative authority or governing body, shall have specifically approved the proposed plan and approved any necessary structural adjustment to the existing system to conform with the proposed plan;

    g. In the case of a referendum authorized under section 218(d)(6) of the social security act and (e)(ii) of this subsection, the retirement system will be divided into two parts or divisions. One part or division of the retirement system shall be composed of positions of those members of the system who desire coverage under the agreement as permitted by this section. The remaining part or division of the retirement system shall be composed of positions of those members who do not desire coverage under such an agreement. Each part or division is a separate retirement system for the purposes of section 218(d) of the social security act. The positions of individuals who become members of the system after the coverage is extended shall be included in the part or division of the system composed of members desiring the coverage, with the exception of positions that are excluded in the agreement.

5. Upon receiving satisfactory evidence that with respect to any such referendum the conditions specified in subsection (4) of this section and section 218(d)(3) of the social security act have been met, the governor shall so certify to the secretary of health and human services.

6. If the legislative body of any political subdivision of this state certifies to the governor that a referendum has been held under the terms of RCW 41.48.050(1)(i) and gives notice to the governor of termination of social security for any coverage group of the political subdivision, the governor shall give two years advance notice in writing to the federal department of health and human services of the termination of the agreement entered into under this section with respect to that coverage group.

It provides that the political subdivision will make such reports, in such form and containing such information, as the governor may from time to time require and comply with such provisions as the governor or the secretary of health, education, and welfare may from time to time find necessary to assure the correctness and verification of such reports;

    g. It authorizes the governor to terminate the plan in its entirety, in his or her discretion, if he or she finds that there has been a failure to comply substantially with any provision contained in such plan, such termination to take effect at the expiration of such notice and on such conditions as may be provided by regulations of the governor and may be consistent with the provisions of the social security act;

        i. The referendum shall be conducted under the supervision of the legislative body of the political subdivision.

        ii. Not less than sixty days' notice of such referendum shall be given to members of the coverage group.

        iii. An opportunity to vote by secret ballot in such referendum shall be given and shall be limited to all members of the coverage group.

        iv. The proposal for termination shall be approved only if a majority of the coverage group vote in favor of termination.

## Section 466
The legislature intends that public employers be prohibited from misclassifying employees, or taking other action to avoid providing or continuing to provide employment-based benefits to which employees are entitled under state law or employer policies or collective bargaining agreements applicable to the employee's correct classification.

Chapter 155, Laws of 2002 does not mandate that any public employer provide benefits to actual temporary, seasonal, or part-time employees beyond the benefits to which they are entitled under state law or employer policies or collective bargaining agreements applicable to the employee's correct classification. Public employers may determine eligibility rules for their own benefit plans and may exclude categories of workers such as "temporary" or "seasonal," so long as the definitions and eligibility rules are objective and applied on a consistent basis. Objective standards, such as control over the work and the length of the employment relationship, should determine whether a person is an employee who is entitled to employee benefits, rather than the arbitrary application of labels, such as "temporary" or "contractor." Common law standards should be used to determine whether a person is performing services as an employee, as a contractor, or as part of an agency relationship.

Chapter 155, Laws of 2002 does not modify any statute or policy regarding the employment of: Public employee retirees who are hired for postretirement employment as provided for in chapter 41.26, 41.--- (the new chapter created in section 504 of this act), 41.32, 41.35, or 41.40 RCW or who work as contractors; or enrolled students who receive employment as student employees or as part of their education or financial aid.

## Section 467

2. [Empty]

Except as provided in (b) and (c) of this subsection, the rule adopted under subsection (1) of this section shall not apply to occupational disease claims resulting from posttraumatic stress disorders of firefighters as defined in RCW 41.26.030(14) (a), (b), (c), and (e) or section 303(17) (a), (b), (c), and (h) of this act and firefighters, including supervisors, employed on a full-time, fully compensated basis as a firefighter of a private sector employer's fire department that includes over fifty such firefighters, and law enforcement officers as defined in RCW 41.26.030(16) (b), (c), and (d) or section 303(19) (b), (c), and (e) of this act, and public safety telecommunicators who receive calls for assistance and dispatch emergency services.

    b. For firefighters as defined in RCW 41.26.030(14) (a), (b), (c), and (e) or section 303(17) (a), (b), (c), and (h) of this act and firefighters, including supervisors, employed on a full-time, fully compensated basis as a firefighter of a private sector employer's fire department that includes over fifty such firefighters, and law enforcement officers as defined in RCW 41.26.030(16) (b), (c), and (d) or section 303(19) (b), (c), and (e) of this act hired after June 7, 2018, and public safety telecommunicators hired after June 11, 2020, (a) of this subsection only applies if the firefighter or law enforcement officer or public safety telecommunicators, as a condition of employment, has submitted to a psychological examination administered by a psychiatrist licensed in the state of Washington under chapter 18.71 RCW or a psychologist licensed in the state of Washington under chapter 18.83 RCW that ruled out the presence of posttraumatic stress disorder from preemployment exposures. If the employer does not provide the psychological examination, (a) of this subsection applies.

    c. Posttraumatic stress disorder for purposes of this subsection and subsection (3) of this section is not considered an occupational disease if the disorder is directly attributed to disciplinary action, work evaluation, job transfer, layoff, demotion, termination, or similar action taken in good faith by an employer.

    d. "Public safety telecommunicators" means individuals who receive and respond to telephone or other electronic requests for emergency assistance, such as law enforcement, fire, and medical services, and dispatch appropriate emergency responders.

3. [Empty]

    a. Except as provided in this subsection, the rule adopted under subsection (1) of this section shall not apply to occupational disease claims resulting from posttraumatic stress disorders of direct care registered nurses as defined in RCW 51.32.395.

    b. The limitation in subsection (2)(c) of this section also applies to this subsection (3).

    c.

The amount of such payments shall be five percent of the monthly benefits payable as a result of the worker's death for each such child but such payments shall not exceed twenty-five percent. Such payments on account of such child or children shall be subtracted from the amount to which such surviving spouse would have been entitled had such surviving spouse had legal custody of all of the children and the surviving spouse shall receive the remainder after such payments on account of such child or children have been subtracted. Such payments on account of a child or children not in the legal custody of such surviving spouse shall be apportioned equally among such children.

    c. Payments to the surviving spouse of the deceased worker shall cease at the end of the month in which remarriage occurs: PROVIDED, That a monthly payment shall be made to the child or children of the deceased worker from the month following such remarriage in a sum equal to five percent of the wages of the deceased worker for one child and a sum equal to five percent for each additional child up to a maximum of five such children. Payments to such child or children shall be apportioned equally among such children. Such sum shall be in place of any payments theretofore made for the benefit of or on account of any such child or children. If the surviving spouse does not have legal custody of any child or children of the deceased worker, or if after the death of the worker, legal custody of such child or children passes from such surviving spouse to another, any payment on account of such child or children not in the legal custody of the surviving spouse shall be made to the person or persons having legal custody of such child or children.

    d. In no event shall the monthly payments provided in this subsection (2) :

However, if the monthly payment computed under this subsection (2)(d)(ii) is greater than one hundred percent of the wages of the deceased worker as determined under RCW 51.08.178, the monthly payment due to the surviving spouse shall be equal to the greater of the monthly wages of the deceased worker or the minimum benefit set forth in this section on June 30, 2008.
