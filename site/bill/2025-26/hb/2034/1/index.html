<h2 id="section-101">Section 101 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-101">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that plan 1 of the Washington law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system (LEOFF plan 1) has been closed to new members for nearly a quarter of a century and is now comprised almost entirely of retirees and survivor beneficiaries. Similarly, employers and employees have made no contributions to the plan for nearly a quarter of a century, and over the life of the plan, over 80 percent of all funds contributed have been from the state through general fund—state appropriations.</p>
<p>As of January 2025, only four active members remain in the plan, as compared to 6,000 annuitants. LEOFF plan 1 has far exceeded full funding and has assets which exceed all projected future liabilities, has a surplus of more than $3,300,000,000 today, and no significant amount of additional benefits can be earned in the plan. By the date most of this act is effective, June 30, 2029, LEOFF plan 1 is projected to reach more than 200 percent of full funding.</p>
<p>The supreme court of the state of Washington, in the 1972 decision Weaver v. Evans, established that the firefighters and police officers, active and retired, have a constitutionally protected contractual right to a secure retirement benefit, funded on a systematic basis. The legislature recognizes that the state of Washington is the ultimate guarantor of the LEOFF plan 1 retirement benefits. While members have a constitutionally protected right to the pension benefits that are provided as part of their contract of employment, there is no such right in surplus assets which are unnecessary to the actuarial soundness of the retirement plan.</p>
<p>The state retains the inherent power to terminate a retirement plan and, upon the dedication of sufficient resources to ensure the actuarial soundness of the benefits promised, is entitled to a reversion of the surplus assets upon termination of the plan.</p>
<p>The legislature has determined that, in order to accomplish the foregoing goals and objectives, it is in the best interest of the members and beneficiaries of LEOFF plan 1 that the plan be terminated and that a restated retirement plan created. It is further determined to be in the best interest of the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the state that surplus assets remaining after adequate actuarial provision for the obligated retirement benefits revert to the state.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that the LEOFF plan 1 termination be performed in accordance with the provisions of the federal internal revenue code that apply to state government pension plans and in recognition of the contract rights of the members and beneficiaries of the plan to an actuarially sound retirement program. Between the enactment of this law and the termination and restatement of LEOFF plan 1, the legislature intends to make any changes necessary to conform with federal requirements following receipt of formal guidance from the federal internal revenue service.</p>
<h2 id="section-102">Section 102 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-102">¶</a></h2>
<p>Plan 1 of the Washington law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system (LEOFF plan 1) is hereby terminated, effective June 30, 2029. During the transition between the termination of LEOFF plan 1 and the establishment of the restated law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system, all LEOFF plan 1 benefits, as they existed prior to termination and restatement, shall continue without interruption.</p>
<h2 id="section-103">Section 103 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-103">¶</a></h2>

The restated law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system established by this chapter may also be referred to by statute and rule as the law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system plan 1. The restated law enforcement plan does not create benefits for members and beneficiaries different than, nor in addition to, those that existed prior to termination and restatement, with the exception of vesting benefits for nonvested members upon the creation of the restated plan in section 318 of this act.</p>

For purposes of this subsection, the term &quot;nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse&quot; means the spouse of the person who is a participant in an employee benefit plan or in whose name an individual retirement account is maintained.

<p>The legislature intends that public employers be prohibited from misclassifying employees, or taking other action to avoid providing or continuing to provide employment-based benefits to which employees are entitled under state law or employer policies or collective bargaining agreements applicable to the employee's correct classification.</p>
<p>Chapter 155, Laws of 2002 does not mandate that any public employer provide benefits to actual temporary, seasonal, or part-time employees beyond the benefits to which they are entitled under state law or employer policies or collective bargaining agreements applicable to the employee's correct classification. Public employers may determine eligibility rules for their own benefit plans and may exclude categories of workers such as &quot;temporary&quot; or &quot;seasonal,&quot; so long as the definitions and eligibility rules are objective and applied on a consistent basis. Objective standards, such as control over the work and the length of the employment relationship, should determine whether a person is an employee who is entitled to employee benefits, rather than the arbitrary application of labels, such as &quot;temporary&quot; or &quot;contractor.&quot; Common law standards should be used to determine whether a person is performing services as an employee, as a contractor, or as part of an agency relationship.</p>
<p>Chapter 155, Laws of 2002 does not modify any statute or policy regarding the employment of: Public employee retirees who are hired for postretirement employment as provided for in chapter 41.26, 41.--- (the new chapter created in section 504 of this act), 41.32, 41.35, or 41.40 RCW or who work as contractors; or enrolled students who receive employment as student employees or as part of their education or financial aid.</p>
