<p>A licensee may extend credit to a consumer in the form of a deferral of some or all of the licensee's fee for resolving the consumer's debts, at no additional expense to the consumer.

<li>
<p>Upon receipt of a consumer's notice of termination, a licensee shall, as soon as possible but in all instances within two business days, advise the consumer of the effect, if any, a termination of the consumer's debt resolution services program would have on previously negotiated installment resolution contracts and pending resolution negotiations. Not later than five business days following the delivery of such advice, and absent further instruction from the consumer, a licensee shall notify the dedicated account service provider of the consumer's termination and request that the dedicated account service provider communicate with the consumer regarding disposition of all funds held in the dedicated account.</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Bears the same proportional relationship to the total fee for renegotiating, resolving, reducing, or altering the terms of the entire debt balance as the individual debt amount bears to the entire debt amount. The individual debt amount and the entire debt amount are those owed at the time the debt was enrolled in the service; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is a percentage of the amount saved as a result of the renegotiation, resolution, reduction, or alteration. The percentage charged cannot change from one individual debt to another. The amount saved is the difference between the amount owed at the time the debt was enrolled in the service and the amount actually paid to satisfy the debt.</p>
