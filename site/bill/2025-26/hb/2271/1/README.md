# HB 2271 - Plastics/recycled content

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2271.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that setting minimum levels of recycled content requirements for a suite of plastic packaging and products is an effective solution to provide both environmental and economic benefits. Minimum recycled content requirements, including those already required under state law for beverage containers, household and personal care product containers, and plastic trash bags, reduce plastic waste and the harmful impacts of fossil fuel extraction used to produce virgin plastic. Such requirements support diversion from landfills as postconsumer plastic materials are kept in use to produce new products. As recycled plastic usage increases, virgin plastic usage decreases along with the significant energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions associated with its production and extraction from fossil fuels.

2. The legislature also finds that additional minimum recycled content requirements are needed to further stimulate both recycled plastics economy by increasing and stabilizing demand for recycled resins, strengthening recycled commodity values, and increasing economic growth, opportunity, and jobs creation in the plastics recycling industry. Recycled content standards support stronger community recycling programs by providing a market for recycled content within the state, region, and country. Stronger markets could expand the amount and types of plastics recycled, and can increase public trust in recycling by ensuring collected recyclables are made back into new products through local and domestic manufacturing.

2. Beginning June 1st of the year following the first year that minimum postconsumer recycled product content requirements apply to a category of PCRC product, and annually thereafter, the department shall determine the penalty for the previous calendar year based on the postconsumer recycled content requirement of the previous calendar year. The department shall calculate the amount of the penalty based upon the amounts in pounds in the aggregate of virgin plastic, postconsumer recycled content plastic, and any other plastic per category used by the producer to produce PCRC products sold or offered for sale in or into Washington state, in accordance with the following:

    a. [Empty]

        i. The annual penalty amount assessed to a producer must equal the product of both of the following: The total pounds of plastic used per category multiplied by the relevant minimum postconsumer recycled plastic target percentage, less the pounds of total plastic multiplied by the percent of postconsumer recycled plastic used; multiplied by 40 cents.

        ii. Example: [(Total pounds of plastic used x minimum postconsumer recycled plastic target percentage) – (Total pounds of plastic used x postconsumer recycled plastic percentage used)] x 40 cents.
