<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The increased frequency of behavioral health emergencies in the community results in increased 911 calls to fire, emergency medical services, and law enforcement. First responders respond to behavioral health emergencies related to drug overdoses, acute suicidal behavior, acute crises, individuals requiring involuntary treatment, and other situations in which there are concerns about medical needs or safety;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to fire, emergency medical services, and law enforcement responses to behavioral health calls, there are over 60 co-response teams currently operating across Washington to de-escalate situations, divert people from criminal justice and emergency medical systems, and bring medical and behavioral health care into the field to serve vulnerable populations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a need for high acuity first response services for people experiencing behavioral health emergencies to complement the 988 crisis line and behavioral health crisis response system. To help address this need, 911 and 988 response systems must work together to create a seamless crisis care delivery system for individuals in crisis; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First responders and co-response teams in the 911 system respond to behavioral health emergencies and other complex needs at the nexus of health and behavioral health. First responders and co-responders are critical to the provision of medical care in the field and ongoing case management and follow-up services, and they also fill gaps in behavioral health crises when there are no mobile crisis teams available.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Provide high quality training and regional collaboration for co-response service delivery to achieve better care and deliver better outcomes for patients;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equip emergency medical services personnel with the training they need to respond to behavioral health emergencies to save lives. With the proper training, first responders will be better prepared and more confident responding to behavioral health emergencies leading to reduced burnout among these professionals; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop funding strategies for first responders to better respond to behavioral health emergencies and save taxpayer money. The funding model will incentivize first responders to connect neighbors in need to the right services which will reduce the dependence on emergency departments as the default drop-off location for persons experiencing a behavioral health crisis. By connecting persons in a behavioral health crisis with therapy, counseling, rehabilitative services, pharmacies, social workers, case workers, and shelters, instead of reimbursing ambulances for trips to the emergency department, communities will see a reduction in emergency department overcrowding.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>By January 1, 2027, the department shall adopt rules related to the recognition of the behavioral health training in subsection (2) of this section as an optional module that may be incorporated into ongoing training and evaluation programs available to emergency medical technicians certified under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By July 1, 2026, the behavioral health crisis outreach response and education center at the University of Washington shall develop a nine-hour training course to instruct emergency medical services personnel, including emergency medical technicians certified under this chapter and physician's trained advanced emergency medical technicians and paramedics certified under RCW 18.71.205, on responding to behavioral health emergencies. The training must be made available statewide in a format that allows for the course to be taught completely in-person, completely online, or a hybrid format of both in-person and online instruction. The training shall be developed in a manner to allow it to be provided through ongoing training and evaluation programs over the course of a three-year period.</p>
