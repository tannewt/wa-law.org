<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The Kigali amendment to the Montreal protocol and the American innovation and manufacturing act of 2020 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 7675), establish phased reductions in hydrofluorocarbon production and consumption but leave gaps in ensuring widespread use of reclaimed refrigerants and managing refrigerants at the end of their life cycle; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State action is urgently needed to complement federal and international efforts by promoting refrigerant recovery, reclamation, and the transition to climate-friendly refrigerants with lower or no global warming potential, through regulations and market-based incentives.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Study feasible pathways to an expeditious transition of new equipment by 2035 to low global warming potential refrigerants of less than 150 carbon dioxide equivalents and ultra-low global warming potential refrigerants of less than 10 carbon dioxide equivalents;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support the development of robust refrigerant recovery infrastructure and foster public-private partnerships to promote the reclamation and reuse of refrigerants;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish a clear regulatory framework for reducing emissions from refrigerants through phased limitations on high global warming potential substances and increasing recovery and use of reclaimed refrigerants; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhance industry compliance and stakeholder collaboration through education, training, and financial incentives, ensuring alignment with national and international climate objectives.</p>
