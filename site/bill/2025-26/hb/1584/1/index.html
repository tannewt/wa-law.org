<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that while voting by mail in Washington has increased turnout in elections, this increase in turnout has come at the expense of ballot security. No longer do voters have the privacy of a voting booth or the security of a polling place, but instead they are subject to potential intimidation, electioneering, and fraud while filling out and casting a ballot.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that trust in the electoral system across the United States has declined due to credible allegations of voter fraud, ballot tampering, and foreign interference in elections. As a result, it is important to institute an electoral process that not only secures the vote from fraud, tampering, and interference, but also restores trust that the outcomes are legitimate and that the election was free and fair.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the legislature intends to ensure ballot security and restore trust in electoral outcomes by reimplementing in-person voting in Washington, while continuing to provide ballot access to those who most need it by allowing for limited absentee voting.</p>

<li>
<p>A voter's absentee ballot request must be sent to the voter's county auditor no earlier than 90 days nor later than the day before the election or primary at which the person seeks to vote. Except as otherwise provided by law, the request may be made orally in person, by telephone, electronically, or in writing. An application or request for an absentee ballot made under the authority of a federal statute or regulation will be considered and given the same effect as a request for an absentee ballot under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A voter requesting an absentee ballot for a primary may also request an absentee ballot for the following general election. A request by an overseas voter or service voter for an absentee ballot for a primary election will also be considered as a request for an absentee ballot for the following general election.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In requesting an absentee ballot, the voter must state the address to which the absentee ballot should be sent. A request for an absentee ballot from an overseas voter or service voter must include the address of the last residence in the state of Washington.</p>

<li>County auditors shall provide special absentee ballots to be used for state primary or state general elections. An auditor shall provide a special absentee ballot only to a registered voter who completes an application stating that she or he will be unable to vote and return a regular absentee ballot by normal mail delivery within the period provided for regular absentee ballots.</li>
</ol>
<p>A special absentee ballot may not be requested more than ninety days before the applicable state primary or general election. The special absentee ballot will list the offices and measures, if known, scheduled to appear on the state primary or general election ballot. The voter may use the special absentee ballot to write in the name of any eligible candidate for each office and vote on any measure.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>The county auditor shall include a listing of any candidates who have filed before the time of the application for offices that will appear on the ballot at that primary or election and a list of any issues that have been referred to the ballot before the time of the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write-in votes on special absentee ballots must be counted in the same manner provided by law for the counting of other write-in votes. The county auditor shall process and canvass the special absentee ballots provided under this section in the same manner as other ballots under this chapter and chapter 29A.60 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A voter who requests a special absentee ballot under this section may also request a regular absentee ballot. If the regular absentee ballot is properly voted and returned, the special absentee ballot is void, and the county auditor shall reject it in whole when special absentee ballots are canvassed.</p>

<li>
<p>Except where a recount or litigation is pending, the county auditor must mail absentee ballots to each voter for whom an absentee ballot request has been approved at least eighteen days before each primary or election, and as soon as possible for all subsequent absentee ballot requests and registration changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except where a recount or litigation is pending, the county auditor must mail absentee ballots to each service and overseas voter for whom an absentee ballot request has been approved at least thirty days before each special election, and at least forty‑five days before each primary or general election, or any special election that involves federal office. A request for an absentee ballot made by an overseas or service voter after that day must be processed immediately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A registered voter may obtain a replacement absentee ballot if the ballot is destroyed, spoiled, lost, or not received by the voter. The voter may obtain the replacement absentee ballot by telephone request, by mail, electronically, or in person. The county auditor shall keep a record of each request for a replacement absentee ballot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within 24 hours of mailing the absentee ballots, the county auditor shall certify to the office of the secretary of state the dates the ballots were mailed. If the absentee ballots are not mailed within timelines specified under subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the auditor must notify the secretary within 24 hours of the reason for the delay and the date the ballots will be mailed . If the county auditor has not provided such information to the secretary by the Monday 15 days before the election, the secretary must contact the county auditor to inquire about the reason for the delay and the date that the auditor expects the absentee ballots will be sent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failure to mail absentee ballots as prescribed in this section does not by itself provide a basis for an election contest or other legal challenge to the results of a primary, general election, or special election.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="section-20">Section 20 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-20">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The county auditor shall send each voter whose absentee ballot request has been approved a ballot, a security envelope in which to conceal the ballot after voting, a larger envelope in which to return the security envelope, a declaration that the voter must sign, and instructions on how to obtain information about the election, how to mark the ballot, and how to return the ballot to the county auditor. The calendar date of the election must be prominently displayed in bold type, twenty-point font or larger, on the envelope sent to the voter containing the ballot and other materials listed in this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The voter must swear under penalty of perjury that he or she meets the qualifications to vote, and has not voted in any other jurisdiction at this election. The declaration must clearly inform the voter that it is illegal to vote if he or she is not a United States citizen; it is illegal to vote if he or she is serving a sentence of total confinement under the jurisdiction of the department of corrections for a felony conviction or is currently incarcerated for a federal or out-of-state felony conviction; it is illegal to cast a ballot or sign a ballot declaration on behalf of another voter; and that the signature on the declaration will be compared to the signature in the voter's registration file. The absentee ballot materials must provide space for the voter to sign the declaration, indicate the date on which the ballot was voted, and include a telephone number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For overseas and service voters, the signed declaration constitutes the equivalent of a voter registration. Return envelopes for overseas and service voters must enable the absentee ballot to be returned postage free if mailed through the United States postal service, United States armed forces postal service, or the postal service of a United States foreign embassy under 39 U.S.C. 3406.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The voter must be instructed to either return the absentee ballot to the county auditor no later than 8:00 p.m. the day of the election or primary, or mail the absentee ballot to the county auditor with a postmark no later than the day of the election or primary. Return envelopes for all election ballots must include prepaid postage. Service and overseas voters must be provided with instructions and a privacy sheet for returning the ballot and signed declaration by fax or email. A voted ballot and signed declaration returned by fax or email must be received by 8:00 p.m. on the day of the election or primary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county auditor's name may not appear on the security envelope, the return envelope, or on any voting instructions or materials included with the absentee ballot if he or she is a candidate for office during the same year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section, &quot;prepaid postage&quot; means any method of return postage paid by the county or state.</p>

<p>County auditors must request that observers be appointed by the major political parties to be present during the processing of ballots at polling places and counting centers. County auditors have discretion to also request that observers be appointed by any campaigns or organizations. The absence of the observers will not prevent the processing of ballots if the county auditor has requested their presence. Observers may not touch any ballots, ballot materials, or election systems. Unauthorized physical contact, or access to ballots or election systems, is a crime subject to punishment under chapter 29A.84 RCW.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>All received return envelopes must be placed in secure locations from the time of delivery to the county auditor until their subsequent opening. After opening the return envelopes, the county canvassing board shall place all of the absentee ballots in secure storage until processing. Ballots may be taken from the inner envelopes and all the normal procedural steps may be performed to prepare these ballots for tabulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The canvassing board, or its designated representatives, shall examine the postmark on the return envelope and signature on the declaration before processing the absentee ballot. The ballot must either be received no later than 8:00 p.m. on the day of the primary or election, or must be postmarked no later than the day of the primary or election. All personnel assigned to verify signatures must receive training on statewide standards for signature verification. The county auditor shall publish on its website the names of all canvassing board members who received training on statewide standards for signature verification and the dates on which the training was completed. Personnel shall verify that the voter's signature on the ballot declaration is the same as the signature of that voter in the registration files of the county. Verification may be conducted by an automated verification system approved by the secretary of state. A variation between the signature of the voter on the ballot declaration and the signature of that voter in the registration files due to the substitution of initials or the use of common nicknames is permitted so long as the surname and handwriting are clearly the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the postmark is  illegible, the date on the absentee ballot declaration to which the voter has attested determines the validity, as to the time of voting, for that ballot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the postmark is missing on a ballot that is received by the county auditor after election day, the ballot may be counted only if the voter signs a declaration attesting, under penalty of perjury, that the ballot was mailed on or before election day. The county auditor must notify every such voter by first-class mail. If the voter has not responded at least three business days before the final meeting of the canvassing board, then the auditor must attempt to notify the voter by telephone, using the voter registration record information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For overseas voters and service voters, the date on the declaration to which the voter has attested determines the validity, as to the time of voting, for that ballot. Any overseas voter or service voter may return the signed declaration and voted ballot by fax or email by 8:00 p.m. on the day of the primary or election, and the county auditor must use established procedures to maintain the secrecy of the ballot.</p>

The voter must be provided information on how to ascertain whether the provisional ballot was counted and, if applicable, the reason why the vote was not counted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any voter may take printed or written material into the voting booth to assist in casting votes. The voter shall not use this material to electioneer and shall remove it when leaving the voting center.</p>

<p>On signing the precinct list of registered voters or being issued a ballot, the voter shall, without leaving the polling place, voting center, or disability access location, proceed to one of the voting booths or voting devices to cast his or her vote. When county election procedures so provide, the election officers may tear off and retain the numbered stub from the ballot before delivering it to the voter. If an election officer has not already done so, when the voter has finished, he or she shall either (a) remove the numbered stub from the ballot, place the ballot in the ballot box, and return the number to the election officers, or (b) deliver the entire ballot to the election officers, who shall remove the numbered stub from the ballot and place the ballot in the ballot box. For a partisan primary in a jurisdiction using the physically separate ballot format, the voter shall also return unvoted party ballots to the precinct election officers, who shall void the unvoted party ballots and return them to the county auditor. If poll-site ballot counting devices are used, the voter shall put the ballot in the device.</p>

As to court orders extending the time for closing the polls, this section does not apply to any voters who were present in the polling place or voting center at the statutory closing time and are permitted to vote under this chapter. This section does not, by itself, authorize any court to order that any individual be permitted to vote or to extend the time for closing the polls, but this section is intended to comply with 52 U.S.C.

<li>
<p>They must verify that the device is placed where it can be conveniently attended by the election officers and conveniently operated by the voters;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They must verify that the number or other designating mark on the device's seal agrees with the control number provided by the elections department.

</li>
<li>
<p>Before processing any ballots through a poll-site ballot counting device, a zero report must be produced. The inspector and at least one of the judges must carefully verify that zero ballots have been run through the poll-site ballot counting device and that all vote totals for each office are zero. If the totals are not zero, the inspector must either reset the device to zero or contact the elections department to reset the device and allow voting to continue using the auxiliary or emergency device.</p>

<p>Whenever poll-site ballot counting devices are used, the devices may either be included with the supplies required in this chapter or they may be delivered to the polling place or voting center separately. All poll-site ballot counting devices must be sealed with a unique numbered seal at the time of final preparation and logic and accuracy testing. A log must be made of all seal numbers and device numbers used.</p>
<h2 id="section-83">Section 83 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-83">¶</a></h2>
<p>The programmed memory pack for each poll-site ballot counting device must be sealed into the device during final preparation and logic and accuracy testing. Except in the case of a device breakdown, the memory pack must remain sealed in the device until after the polls have closed and all reports and telephonic or electronic transfer of results are completed. After all reporting is complete, the precinct election officers responsible for transferring the sealed voted ballots under RCW 29A.60.110 must ensure that the memory pack is returned to the elections department. If the entire poll-site ballot counting device is returned, the memory pack must remain sealed in the device. If the poll-site ballot counting device is to remain at the polling place or voting center, the precinct election officer shall break the seal on the device and remove the memory pack and seal and return it along with the irregularly voted ballots and special ballots to the elections department on election day.</p>

Such precinct election officers, whenever possible, should be residents of the precinct in which they serve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county auditor may delete from the lists of names submitted to the auditor by the chairpersons of the county central committees:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The names of those persons who indicate to the auditor that they cannot or do not wish to serve as precinct election officers for the primary or election or who otherwise cannot so serve; and</p>

The chair may, within five business days of being notified by the auditor, add to the party's nomination list the names of additional persons belonging to that political party who are qualified to serve on the election boards. To the extent that, following this procedure, the number of persons whose names appear on the official nomination lists of the political parties is insufficient to provide the number of election inspectors and judges required for a primary or election, the auditor may appoint a properly trained person whose name does not appear on such a list as an inspector or judge of election for a precinct.</p>
