## Section 1
The legislature recognizes that many children and students struggle with mental health, substance use, and behavioral health challenges that impact their ability to engage in learning and develop pathways to wellness and success. The mental and behavioral health crisis for children and youth in the United States has reached a critical point. The legislature also recognizes that behavioral health and wellness supports for K-12 students in Washington are fragmented, with roles and responsibilities assigned across several local and state agencies. The department of health, the Washington state health care authority, and the office of the superintendent of public instruction all play significant but distinct roles, as do regional educational service districts, local school districts, and community partners. Nonetheless, schools are often community hubs making them a natural setting for prevention, early intervention, and service delivery related to mental and behavioral health so that students can fully access their right to a basic education.

The legislature also recognizes the investments made to support student behavioral health and well-being and that despite those investments, school districts lack the dedicated funding and coordinated supports necessary to deploy comprehensive supports and direct services across the behavioral health continuum for their students.

Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to create a connected statewide network for student mental and behavioral health to maintain, expand, and provide oversight to Washington's school-based mental and behavioral health system for children and adolescents across the state.

## Section 2
1. Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the office of the superintendent of public instruction, in collaboration with local education agencies, the Washington association of educational service districts, and other state agencies as applicable, including the health care authority, the department of health, and the department of children, youth, and families, shall (a) establish strategic direction and goals for statewide programming to strengthen the capacity of local education agencies to meet the recognition, initial screening, and response requirements outlined in RCW 28A.320.127 and (b) provide state-level coordination to help schools better promote mental well-being as well as identify and connect students to behavioral health supports in school and interconnected community settings.

2. At a minimum, the state-level coordination and strategic direction and goals mandated in subsection (1) of this section must include:

    a. In alignment with the Washington integrated student supports protocol, tools, guidance, and supports for school districts to offer coordinated student supports related to behavioral health, including prevention and awareness, student engagement, and student access to the full continuum of school-based behavioral health services;

    b. Guidance and streamline processes to maximize access to state and federal resources;

    c. Coordination with training and technical assistance entities who support local education agencies in designing, funding, and implementing comprehensive student behavioral health supports based on the tools, guidance, and supports established in (a) of this subsection;

        i. A review process for continuous improvement of services and monitoring of the impact and alignment of statewide efforts related to student behavioral health, including the regional school safety centers established in RCW 28A.310.510 and the regional school-based mental and behavioral health student assistance program established in section 3 of this act.

The purpose of the program is to support the office of the superintendent of public instruction through increased regional deployment of behavioral and mental health supports, including substance abuse prevention and intervention services in communities with limited access to behavioral and mental health services across Washington state. The Washington association of educational service districts shall provide overall coordination of the program across the regions.

2. At a minimum, each regional program must:

    a. Work in conjunction with the office of the superintendent of public instruction as prescribed in section 2 of this act and permitted under RCW 28A.310.470 to form a statewide network for student mental and behavioral health;

    b. Provide aligned student behavioral health assistance prevention and intervention services in schools by:

        iv. Providing individual and group intervention services using evidence-based practices;

    e. Support behavioral health career pathways through hiring new nonlicensed staff who receive training, supervision, and internship opportunities to explore career pathways in behavioral health. For educational service districts that are licensed as behavioral health agencies this may include hiring licensure candidates and licensed staff that would like to pursue a career in school-based behavioral health.

3. Educational service districts that are licensed as behavioral health agencies may pilot the integration of telehealth services and provide in-person treatment services to support students in need of more focused mental health treatment support.

4. The Washington association of education service districts shall support the regional programs by:

    a. Establishing consistent criteria for school participation in the program;

    b. Establishing an overall evaluation and reporting of program outcomes from across the regions;

    c. Engaging with regional programs and providers in the administration of validated capacity assessments to measure action plans for the ability to sustain implementation efforts;

    d. Supporting the office of the superintendent of public instruction in coordinating statewide data collection and progress monitoring; and
