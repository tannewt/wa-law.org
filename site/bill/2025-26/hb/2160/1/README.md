    b. While school employees' benefits board members are carrying out their powers and duties under this chapter, if the service of any certificated or classified employee results in a need for a school employees' benefits board organization to employ a substitute for such certificated or classified employee during such service, payment for such a substitute may be made by the authority from funds appropriated by the legislature for the school employees' benefits board program. If such substitute is paid by the authority, no deduction shall be made from the salary of the certificated or classified employee. In no event shall a school employees' benefits board organization deduct from the salary of a certificated or classified employee serving on the school employees' benefits board more than the amount paid the substitute employed by the school employees' benefits board organization.

5. The director of the authority or his or her designee shall be the chair and another member shall be selected by the school employees' benefits board as vice chair. The chair shall conduct meetings of the school employees' benefits board. The vice chair shall preside over meetings in the absence of the chair.

    a. Study all matters connected with the provision of health care coverage, life insurance, liability insurance, accidental death and dismemberment, and disability insurance, or any of, or combination of, the enumerated types of insurance for eligible school employees and their dependents on the best basis possible with relation both to the welfare of the school employees and the state. However, liability insurance should not be made available to dependents;

    b. Develop school employee benefit plans that include comprehensive, evidence-based health care benefits for school employees. In developing these plans, the school employees' benefits board shall consider the following elements:

    d. Determine the terms and conditions of school employee and dependent eligibility criteria, enrollment policies, and scope of coverage. Employer groups obtaining benefits through contractual agreement with the authority for school employees defined in RCW 41.05.011(6)(b)(iv) may contractually agree with the authority to benefits eligibility criteria which differs from that determined by the school employees' benefits board.

        iii. That benefits eligibility is presumed at the start of a school year if the school employee worked at least 630 hours in the prior school year and returns to the same type of position with any employer; and

        iv. Coverage for dependents, including criteria for legal spouses; children up to age twenty-six; children of any age with disabilities, mental illness, or intellectual or other developmental disabilities; and state registered domestic partners, as defined in RCW 26.60.020, and others authorized by the legislature;

    e. Establish terms and conditions for a school employees' benefits board organization to have the ability to locally negotiate eligibility criteria for a school employee who is anticipated to work less than six hundred thirty hours in a school year.

    f. Establish penalties to be imposed when a school employees' benefits board organization fails to comply with established participation criteria; and

    g.
