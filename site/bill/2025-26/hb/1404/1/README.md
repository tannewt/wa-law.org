# HB 1404 - Free school meals

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1404.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that providing all public school students with access to meals served without charge each school day will support academic success and promote student well-being. The legislature, in support of students, families, and productive learning environments, and in recognition of financial challenges that can create barriers to academic achievement, declares that no student should ever experience hunger or food insecurity within a public school.

The legislature, therefore, intends to provide all requesting students with access to school meals that are served without charge.

## Section 2
The purpose of this section is to provide for the allocation of state funding that the legislature deems necessary to support school districts in offering the minimum instructional program of basic education under RCW 28A.150.220. The allocation shall be determined as follows:

## Section 3

    a. Except as provided otherwise by this section and RCW 28A.235.160, beginning with the 2026-27 school year, each school district shall provide breakfast and lunch each school day to any student who requests a breakfast, lunch, or both. The school district must provide the meals at no charge to the student and without consideration of the student's eligibility for a federally reimbursed free or reduced-price meal. Meals provided under this section must be nutritiously adequate and qualify for federal reimbursement under the school lunch program or the school breakfast program, and students are not eligible for more than one meal in a meal service period.

    b. The requirements in (a) of this subsection

, for purposes of having schools participating in the United States department of agriculture's community eligibility provision under RCW 28A.235.300 complete the duration of the provision's four-year cycle, do not apply to schools participating in the  community eligibility provision  that have not completed the duration of the provision's four-year cycle.

2. The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall reimburse school districts, subject to the requirements of subsection (1) of this section, on a per meal reimbursement basis for meals that are not  reimbursed at the United States department of agriculture's free rate. The additional state reimbursement amount must be the difference between the United States department of agriculture's free rate and the United States department of agriculture's paid rate, plus an additional amount of $0.05 per meal or a higher amount if authorized in the omnibus appropriations act.

3. School districts, in accordance with RCW 28A.235.160, may be exempted from the requirements of this section.

4. To maximize federal funding, school districts must continue collecting free and reduced-price meal eligibility applications where applicable and run direct certification at least monthly in accordance with RCW 28A.235.280. School districts shall also annually monitor data for eligibility in the United States department of agriculture community eligibility provision and apply where eligible as required in RCW 28A.235.300.

5. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:

    a. "Public school" has the same meaning as in RCW 28A.150.010.

7. The requirements in this section shall lapse if the federal reimbursement for  school breakfasts or lunches is eliminated.

## Section 4
1. For the purposes of this section:

    a. "Free or reduced-price lunch" means a lunch served by a school district participating in the national school lunch program to a student qualifying for national school lunch program benefits based on family size-income criteria.

    b.

"School breakfast program" means a program meeting federal requirements defined in 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1773.

    c. "School lunch program" means a meal program meeting the requirements defined in Title 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1751 et seq.

    d. "Summer food service program" means a meal or snack program meeting the requirements defined by the superintendent of public instruction under subsection (3) of this section.

2. School districts shall implement a school lunch program and school breakfast program in each public school in the district in which educational services are provided to students. In accordance with RCW 28A.235.135, school districts shall provide meals at no charge to all requesting students at public schools . In developing and implementing its school lunch program and school breakfast program, each school district may consult with an advisory committee including school staff, community members, and others appointed by the board of directors of the district.

3.

Each school district shall implement a summer food service program in each public school in the district in which a summer program of academic, enrichment, or remedial services is provided and in which 50 percent or more of the children enrolled in the school meet federal eligibility requirements for free or reduced-price lunch. However, the superintendent of public instruction shall develop rules establishing criteria to permit an exemption for a school that can demonstrate availability of an adequate alternative summer feeding program. Sites providing meals should be open to all children in the area, unless a compelling case can be made to limit access to the program. The superintendent of public instruction shall adopt a definition of compelling case and a schedule for implementation as follows:

    a. Beginning the summer of 2005 if the school currently offers a school breakfast or lunch program; or

    b. Beginning the summer following the school year during which a school implements a school lunch program under this section.

4. Schools not offering a summer food service program may meet the meal service requirements of subsection (3) of this section through any of the following:

    a. Preparing the meals on-site;

    b. Receiving the meals from another school that participates in a United States department of agriculture child nutrition program; or

    c. Contracting with a nonschool entity that is a licensed food service establishment under RCW 69.07.010.

5. The legislature does not intend to include school lunch, breakfast, or summer food service programs, or the requirements of RCW 28A.235.135, within the state's obligation for basic education funding under Article IX of the state Constitution.

6. The requirements in this section shall lapse if the federal reimbursement for  school breakfasts, lunches, or summer food service programs is eliminated.

7. School districts may be exempted from the requirements of this section and RCW 28A.235.135 by showing good cause why they cannot comply with the office of the superintendent of public instruction to the extent that such exemption is not in conflict with federal or state law. The process and criteria by which school districts may be exempted shall be developed by rule and revised if necessary by the office of the superintendent of public instruction in consultation with representatives of school directors, school food service, community-based organizations, and a state organization of parents and teachers.
