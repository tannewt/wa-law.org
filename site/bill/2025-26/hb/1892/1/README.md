## Section 1
1. Any person injured by an individual who was previously arrested for a violent offense, and subsequently released from custody before trial for such offense or not reasonably criminally prosecuted for such offense as a result of a state law that makes it easier for the individual to obtain pretrial release or evade reasonable criminal prosecution than it would be in the absence of such law, has a cause of action against any state legislator that voted in favor of such law in committee or on the floor of the Washington house of representatives or senate, if: (a) The individual caused the injury after being released from custody; and (b) the state legislator failed to adequately consider the risk of public harm that could result from the individual being released from custody.

2. For the purposes of this section, "state legislator" means all members of the Washington house of representatives and senate.

3. For the purposes of this section, "violent offense" has the same meaning as defined in RCW 9.94A.030.

4. For the purposes of this section, adequate consideration requires:

    a. A written and published assessment that analyzes:

        i. All known evidence about the risks of future criminal misconduct by individuals who have been accused of or arrested for a violent crime and are then subsequently released before trial or not reasonably criminally prosecuted;

        ii. The vulnerability and rights of crime victims; and

        iii. The adequacy of alternatives to pretrial detention and reasonable criminal prosecution; and

    b. Consideration of all relevant and reasonably available evidence, including public records, and the testimony of law enforcement officials and experts and crime victims and crime victim advocates.

5. No form of legislative immunity may be raised as an immunity or defense to any action brought under this section, including without limitation any immunity or defense premised on the argument that a legislator or government has absolute immunity for purely legislative acts, or that immunity is warranted or necessary to avoid rendering the legislative process inoperable.

6. In an action brought under this section, the court shall award to a prevailing plaintiff actual damages as determined by the trier of fact, and shall make an award of at least nominal damages. The court may also award to a prevailing plaintiff costs and reasonable attorneys' fees. The court may grant declaratory and injunctive relief as it deems appropriate.

7. [Empty]

    a. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, nothing in this section is intended to limit the right of an elected or appointed official to have a legal defense provided at the expense of the state or a political subdivision of the state, or to have any judgment under this section satisfied by the state or a political subdivision of the state under chapter 4.92 or 4.96 RCW.

    b. Whenever a claim is brought under this section, if the trier of fact finds by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly disregarded the risk of public harm when the defendant voted in favor of a state law making it easier for an individual accused of a crime to obtain pretrial release or evade reasonable criminal prosecution, then:

        i. The defendant shall be personally liable for all costs of defense and judgment;

        ii. The state and any political subdivision of the state must not pay any of the defendant's subsequent costs of defense or judgment; and

        iii. Any costs of defense the state or any political subdivision of the state has previously paid must be repaid by the defendant within one year of entry of judgment.

8. A cause of action under this section must be commenced within three years after the cause of action accrues. For the purpose of this section, a cause of action accrues when the plaintiff discovers, or in the reasonable exercise of diligence should discover, the elements of the cause of action.

9. This section must be liberally construed to effect its beneficial and remedial purposes.

10. Nothing in this section affects any other common law or statutory right of action available to a plaintiff.

11. This section applies only to causes of action arising on or after the effective date of this section.

The expenses paid by the local governmental entity may include costs associated with an appeal of the decision rendered by the superior court concerning the sufficiency of the recall charge.

4. Except as provided in section 1(7) of this act, when an officer, employee, or volunteer of the local governmental entity has been represented at the expense of the local governmental entity under subsection (1) of this section and the court hearing the action has found that the officer, employee, or volunteer was acting within the scope of his or her official duties, and a judgment has been entered against the officer, employee, or volunteer under chapter 4.96 RCW or 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981 et seq., thereafter the judgment creditor shall seek satisfaction for nonpunitive damages only from the local governmental entity, and judgment for nonpunitive damages shall not become a lien upon any property of such officer, employee, or volunteer.
