<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that health insurance carriers, health plans, and managed care organizations are the decision makers for the type and level of care covered for an enrollee's health care benefits and are not responsible for determining or altering an enrollee's diagnosis or treatment plan. It is not always transparent who the decision maker is or how decisions are made in determining enrollee coverage for treatment, prescription drugs, or services. Artificial intelligence is being increasingly utilized by carriers, health plans, and managed care organizations to make or aid in decisions about medical necessity and coverage of provider-recommended treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to increase transparency in the prior authorization process for health care coverage decisions and to ensure licensed physicians and licensed health professionals remain responsible for making determinations about coverage for treatment, prescription drugs, and services that are medically necessary. If artificial intelligence tools are used to aid in the decision-making process, standards must be put in place to ensure these tools are not used to make inappropriate determinations that could impact the health of an enrollee.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Each carrier offering a health plan issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2024, shall comply with the following standards related to prior authorization for health care services and prescription drugs:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The carrier shall meet the following time frames for prior authorization determinations and notifications to a participating provider or facility that submits the prior authorization request through an electronic prior authorization process, as designated by each carrier:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>For electronic standard prior authorization requests, the carrier shall make a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of the decision within three calendar days, excluding holidays, of submission of an electronic prior authorization request by the provider or facility that contains the necessary information to make a determination. If insufficient information has been provided to the carrier to make a decision, the carrier shall request any additional information from the provider or facility within one calendar day of submission of the electronic prior authorization request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For electronic expedited prior authorization requests, the carrier shall make a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of the decision within one calendar day of submission of an electronic prior authorization request by the provider or facility that contains the necessary information to make a determination. If insufficient information has been provided to the carrier to make a decision, the carrier shall request any additional information from the provider or facility within one calendar day of submission of the electronic prior authorization request.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The carrier shall meet the following time frames for prior authorization determinations and notifications to a participating provider or facility that submits the prior authorization request through a process other than an electronic prior authorization process:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>For nonelectronic standard prior authorization requests, the carrier shall make a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of the decision within five calendar days of submission of a nonelectronic prior authorization request by the provider or facility that contains the necessary information to make a determination. If insufficient information has been provided to the carrier to make a decision, the carrier shall request any additional information from the provider or facility within five calendar days of submission of the nonelectronic prior authorization request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For nonelectronic expedited prior authorization requests, the carrier shall make a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of the decision within two calendar days of submission of a nonelectronic prior authorization request by the provider or facility that contains the necessary information to make a determination. If insufficient information has been provided to the carrier to make a decision, the carrier shall request any additional information from the provider or facility within one calendar day of submission of the nonelectronic prior authorization request.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In any instance in which a carrier has determined that a provider or facility has not provided sufficient information for making a determination under (a) and (b) of this subsection, a carrier may establish a specific reasonable time frame for submission of the additional information. This time frame must be communicated to the provider and enrollee with a carrier's request for additional information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The carrier's prior authorization requirements must be described in detail and written in easily understandable language. The carrier shall make its most current prior authorization requirements and restrictions, including the written clinical review criteria, available to providers and facilities in an electronic format upon request. The prior authorization requirements must be based on peer-reviewed clinical review criteria. The clinical review criteria must be evidence-based criteria and must accommodate new and emerging information related to the appropriateness of clinical criteria with respect to black and indigenous people, other people of color, gender, and underserved populations. The clinical review criteria must be evaluated and updated, if necessary, at least annually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When issuing a notification for a prior authorization determination, the carrier and any contracted health care benefit manager shall include a unique identifier for the individual who initially reviewed and made the determination. The carrier must also include the national provider identification number of the physician who had clinical oversight for the determination as well as the physician's credentials, board certifications, and areas of specialty expertise and training in any notification sent to the health plan enrollee and provider requesting or referring the service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of an adverse benefit determination, a carrier shall make available to the requesting provider a peer-to-peer review discussion. The peer reviewer provided by the carrier must possess a current and valid nonrestricted license to practice medicine in Washington state and must be knowledgeable of and have experience providing the same or similar service as the health care service under review, and must have authority to modify or overturn the care determination decision.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carriers maintain the ability to make adjustments to policies and procedures that impact the applicability of their prior authorization requirements. Beginning August 1, 2025, these adjustments can only be made once annually and go into effect January 1st of any given calendar year. Notification of policy changes must be provided to all in-network providers at least four months prior to the January 1st effective date. The notification must be provided independent to other policy changes or provider notification publications and be easily accessible in electronic provider and enrollee portals.</p>

<p>A determination of medical necessity shall be made only by a licensed physician or a licensed health professional working within their scope of practice. The licensed physician or licensed health professional shall evaluate the specific clinical issues involved in the health care services requested by the requesting provider by reviewing and considering the requesting provider's recommendation, the enrollee's medical or other clinical history, as applicable, and individual clinical circumstances. An artificial intelligence, algorithm, or related software tool shall not be the sole means used to deny, delay, or modify health care services.</p>

<pre><code>    ii. The artificial intelligence, algorithm, or other software tool does not base its determination solely on a group data set;

    iii. The artificial intelligence, algorithm, or other software tool's criteria and guidelines complies with this chapter and applicable state and federal law;

    iv. The use of the artificial intelligence, algorithm, or other software tool does not discriminate, directly or indirectly, against an enrollee in violation of state or federal law;

v. The artificial intelligence, algorithm, or other software tool is fairly and equitably applied, including in accordance with any applicable regulations and guidance issued by the federal department of health and human services;

vi. The policies and procedures for using the artificial intelligence, algorithm, or other software tool is open to audit by the office of the insurance commissioner;

vii. The artificial intelligence, algorithm, or other software tool's performance, use, and outcomes are periodically reviewed to maximize accuracy and reliability; and

viii. Patient data is not used beyond its intended and stated purpose, consistent with chapter 70.02 RCW and the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1320d et al., as applicable.

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The health plan shall meet the following time frames for prior authorization determinations and notifications to a participating provider or facility that submits the prior authorization request through an electronic prior authorization process:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>For electronic standard prior authorization requests, the health plan shall make a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of the decision within three calendar days, excluding holidays, of submission of an electronic prior authorization request by the provider or facility that contains the necessary information to make a determination. If insufficient information has been provided to the health plan to make a decision, the health plan shall request any additional information from the provider or facility within one calendar day of submission of the electronic prior authorization request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For electronic expedited prior authorization requests, the health plan shall make a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of the decision within one calendar day of submission of an electronic prior authorization request by the provider or facility that contains the necessary information to make a determination.

<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>For nonelectronic standard prior authorization requests, the health plan shall make a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of the decision within five calendar days of submission of a nonelectronic prior authorization request by the provider or facility that contains the necessary information to make a determination. If insufficient information has been provided to the health plan to make a decision, the health plan shall request any additional information from the provider or facility within five calendar days of submission of the nonelectronic prior authorization request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For nonelectronic expedited prior authorization requests, the health plan shall make a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of the decision within two calendar days of submission of a nonelectronic prior authorization request by the provider or facility that contains the necessary information to make a determination. If insufficient information has been provided to the health plan to make a decision, the health plan shall request any additional information from the provider or facility within one calendar day of submission of the nonelectronic prior authorization request.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In any instance in which the health plan has determined that a provider or facility has not provided sufficient information for making a determination under (a) and (b) of this subsection, the health plan may establish a specific reasonable time frame for submission of the additional information. This time frame must be communicated to the provider and enrollee with the health plan's request for additional information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The prior authorization requirements of the health plan must be described in detail and written in easily understandable language. The health plan shall make its most current prior authorization requirements and restrictions, including the written clinical review criteria, available to providers and facilities in an electronic format upon request. The prior authorization requirements must be based on peer-reviewed clinical review criteria. The clinical review criteria must be evidence-based criteria and must accommodate new and emerging information related to the appropriateness of clinical criteria with respect to black and indigenous people, other people of color, gender, and underserved populations. The clinical review criteria must be evaluated and updated, if necessary, at least annually.</p>
