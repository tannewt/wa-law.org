<li>
<p>A local government may enter into a development agreement with a person having ownership or control of real property within its jurisdiction. A city may enter into a development agreement for real property outside its boundaries as part of a proposed annexation or a service agreement. A development agreement must set forth the development standards and other provisions that shall apply to and govern and vest the development, use, and mitigation of the development of the real property for the duration specified in the agreement. A development agreement shall be consistent with applicable development regulations adopted by a local government planning under chapter 36.70A RCW, except that a development agreement with a regional transit authority created under chapter 81.112 RCW may set forth development standards that vary from otherwise applicable development regulations not involving compliance with the Americans with disabilities act in order to accommodate development of the facilities of the regional transit authority.</p>
</li>
<li>
