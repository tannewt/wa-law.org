A health care entity where primary care services are provided may comply with this subsection by:

    b. Incorporating a prompt for hepatitis B screening tests and hepatitis C screening tests for the recommended populations into the health care entity's electronic health record system; or

    c. Sending routine mailers or electronic communications to the health care entity's primary care patients that meet the recommended screening indications informing patients of the availability and importance of hepatitis B screening tests and hepatitis C screening tests.

2. A hepatitis B screening test and a hepatitis C screening test are not required to be offered by the health care entity if:

    a. The patient is being treated for a life-threatening emergency;

    c. The patient lacks capacity to consent to a hepatitis B screening test or a hepatitis C screening test, or both.

3. [Empty]

    a. If the patient accepts the offer of the hepatitis B screening test and the test is hepatitis B surface antigen positive, the health care provider within the health care entity shall offer the patient follow-up health care or refer the patient to another health care provider who can provide follow-up health care.

    b. If a patient accepts the offer of the hepatitis C screening test and the test is positive, the health care provider within the health care entity shall offer the patient follow-up health care or refer the patient to another health care provider who can provide follow-up health care.

6. This section does not affect the scope of practice of any health care provider or diminish any authority or legal or professional obligation of any health care provider to offer a hepatitis B screening test, hepatitis C screening test, or both, or a hepatitis C diagnostic test, or to provide services or care for the patient of a hepatitis B screening test, hepatitis C screening test, or both, or a hepatitis C diagnostic test.

7. A health care provider or health care entity where primary care services are provided that fails to comply with the requirements of this section shall not be subject to any actions related to their licensure or certification, or to any civil or criminal liability, because of the health care entity's failure to comply with the requirements of this section.
