## Section 1
(1) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, there shall be in effect in all counties and cities the state building code which shall consist of the following model codes which are hereby adopted by reference:

## Section 2
1. Upon the completion of a statewide wildfire hazard map and a base-level wildfire risk map for each county of the state, per RCW 43.30.580, the state building code council shall, by November 1, 2029, adopt by rule the International Wildland Urban Interface Code, published by the International Code Council, Inc.,

or portions thereof adopted pursuant to RCW 19.27.031, shall be implemented. The state building code council shall collaborate with other relevant state agencies and entities, including the department of natural resources and regional fire defense boards pursuant to RCW 43.43.962, and local governments, including, but not limited to, building officials and urban forestry specialists to consider up-to-date wildfire science and create regionally appropriate building codes. Prior to final approval of the statewide maps developed pursuant to RCW 43.30.580, the department of natural resources shall coordinate with the regional fire defense boards established in RCW 43.43.963 for a review of the proposed statewide maps.

2. Until 90 days after the completion of an optional code pursuant to subsection (4) of this section, all counties, cities, and towns may adopt the International Wildland Urban Interface Code, published by the International Code Council, Inc., in whole or any portion thereof.

3.

All counties, cities, and towns may complete their own wildfire hazard and base-level wildfire risk map for use in applying the code enumerated in subsections (1) and (2) of this section. Counties, cities, and towns may continue to use locally adopted wildfire risk maps until completion of a statewide wildfire hazard map and base-level wildfire risk map for each county of the state per RCW 43.30.580. Six months after the statewide wildfire hazard map and base-level wildfire risk map is complete, any map adopted by counties, cities, and towns must utilize the same or substantially similar criteria as the map required by subsection (1) of this section.

4. The state building code council may adopt by rule technical provisions of the International Wildland Urban Interface Code as an optional code to be used by cities and counties that have completed wildfire hazard maps and base-level wildfire risk maps pursuant to subsection (3) of this section for implementation. Upon the completion of a statewide wildfire hazard map and a base-level wildfire risk map for each county as required in RCW 43.30.580, the adoption of an optional code as provided in this subsection (4) shall no longer apply.

5. All counties, cities, and towns issuing commercial and residential building permits for parcels in areas identified as high hazard and very high hazard on the map required by subsection (1) of this section or adopted according to subsection (3) of this section shall apply the code enumerated in subsections (1) or (2) of this section.

6. When developing defensible space requirements under the International Wildland Urban Interface Code, the state building code council must coordinate with the department of ecology, the department of fish and wildlife, the department of commerce, and local governments to ensure that such defensible space requirements align with the requirements of the growth management act, shoreline master programs, and other applicable environmental regulations adopted by the state.

7. All counties and cities, with the approval of the local fire marshal, may adopt local amendments to the International Wildland Urban Interface Code as needed to meet local conditions or constraints. Amendments affecting single-family or multifamily residential buildings shall not be effective unless the amendment is approved by the building code council pursuant to RCW 19.27.074(1)(b).

## Section 3
1. The department shall, to the extent practical within existing resources, establish a program of technical assistance to counties, cities, and towns for the development of findings of fact and maps establishing the wildland urban interface areas of jurisdictions in accordance with the requirements of the International Wildland Urban Interface Code as adopted by reference in RCW 19.27.560.

2. The department shall develop and administer a grant program, subject to funding provided for this purpose, to provide direct financial assistance to counties, cities, and towns for the development of findings of fact and maps establishing wildland urban interface areas. Applications for grant funds must be submitted by counties, cities, and towns in accordance with regulations adopted by the department. The department is authorized to make and administer grants on the basis of applications, within appropriations authorized by the legislature, to any county, city, or town for the purpose of developing findings of fact and maps establishing wildland urban interface areas.

3. The department shall establish and maintain a statewide wildfire hazard map and a base-level wildfire risk map for each county of the state based upon criteria established in coordination with the state fire marshal office. Prior to final approval of the statewide wildfire hazard map and base-level wildfire risk map, the department of natural resources shall coordinate with the regional fire defense boards established in RCW 43.43.963 to review and receive input on the proposed statewide maps. The hazard map shall be made available on the department's website and shall designate areas as low, moderate, high, and very high wildfire hazard. The risk map shall be made available on the department's website and designate vulnerable resources or assets based on their exposure and susceptibility to a wildfire hazard. The department shall establish a method by which local governments may update the wildfire hazard map and wildfire risk map based on local assessments and approved by the jurisdiction's fire marshal. The department shall make publicly available the criteria and analysis utilized in assessing the wildfire hazard and risk.
