<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that data centers are emerging large energy use facilities that have the potential to significantly affect Washington's energy affordability and reliability, local communities, jobs, environment, and economy.</p>
<p>Data centers are projected to grow rapidly over the next several years, making up the largest source of expected electricity load growth in the Pacific Northwest. The legislature established tax incentives for data centers starting in 2010. However, since that time, the data center industry has undergone major changes. Data centers are growing larger to support artificial intelligence, and there is high uncertainty about many aspects of the future of this rapidly evolving, emerging industry.</p>
<p>The development of data centers has brought benefits including construction jobs and significant new tax revenues to Washington, especially to rural communities. Data centers are also major users of electricity, water, and refrigerant chemicals, though information about data center resource use and environmental impacts is difficult if not impossible for the public to access.</p>
<p>The legislature intends to enact policies governing these emerging large energy use facilities. For these emerging large energy use facilities, the legislature's policy priorities are affordability, grid reliability, transparency, and environmental protection. The legislature intends to protect energy affordability for consumers; ensure that data center energy demands do not harm the reliability of the electric grid; require transparency about energy, water, and refrigerant use; and require the use of 100 percent clean energy over time.</p>
<p>The technology industry plays an important role in Washingtonians' lives and in the state's economy. The legislature intends to require data centers to meet a high standard for performance, building on the industry's ability to innovate and lead, while protecting and delivering benefits to Washington consumers, workers, communities, and environment.</p>

<li>
<p>The benefits of all allowances consigned to auction under this section must be used by consumer-owned and investor-owned electric utilities for the benefit of ratepayers, with the first priority the mitigation of any rate impacts to low-income customers. Starting for no-cost allowances provided for calendar year 2027, the benefits of allowances consigned to auction under this section may not be used by consumer-owned and investor-owned electric utilities for the primary benefit of emerging large energy use facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an entity is identified by the department as an emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industry under RCW 70A.65.110, unless allowances have been otherwise allocated for electricity-related emissions to the entity under RCW 70A.65.110 or to a consumer-owned utility under this section, the department shall allocate allowances at no cost to the electric utility or power marketing administration that is providing electricity to the entity in an amount equal to the forecasted emissions for electricity consumption for the entity for the compliance period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall allow for allowances to be transferred between a power marketing administration and electric utilities and used for direct compliance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rules establishing the allocation of allowances to consumer-owned utilities and investor-owned utilities must consider, in a manner consistent with subsection (1) of this section, the impact of electrification of buildings, transportation, and industry on the electricity sector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section affects the requirements of chapter 19.405 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A consumer-owned utility that is party to a contract that meets the following conditions must be issued allowances under this section for emissions associated with imported electricity, in order to prevent impairment of the value of the contract to either party:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The contract does not address compliance costs imposed upon the consumer-owned utility by the program created in this chapter; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The contract was in effect as of July 25, 2021, and expires no later than the end of the first compliance period.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>By July 31st each year, starting in calendar year 2026, each utility must provide to the department a list of existing and forecast retail customers that are emerging large energy use facilities to enable the department to provide allowance allocation consistent with subsection (1) of this section. For each facility the utility must indicate the forecast maximum delivery of power to the facility for the following four years, forecast annual retail load in megawatt-hours for the following four years, customer name, and facility type. The department may update these reporting requirements by rule.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-8">Section 8 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-8">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Beginning July 1, 2026, each emerging large energy use facility must pay a fee to the department of revenue. The emerging large energy use facility fee is due annually each July 1st.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fee is $0.005 per kilowatt hour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fee is to be paid in the manner and form prescribed by the department of revenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proceeds of this fee must be deposited into the emerging large energy use facility account created in section 9 of this act.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-9">Section 9 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9">¶</a></h2>
<p>The emerging large energy use facility account is created in the state treasury. All receipts from emerging large energy use facilities as authorized in section 8 of this act must be deposited in the account. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Sixty percent of the expenditures from the account must be used for energy assistance, weatherization, low-income home electrification, and related readiness upgrade purposes, which may include the following programs administered by the department of commerce: The low-income residential weatherization program as described in chapter 70A.35 RCW, the state home energy assistance program, and the low-income home rehabilitation grant program as described in chapter 43.330 RCW. It is the intent of the legislature for these funds to add to rather than supplant or reduce other state investments for these purposes. Forty percent of the expenditures from the account must be appropriated to the student achievement council to distribute to public institutions of higher education as defined in chapter 28B.10 RCW for the following higher education purposes: Career services, quantum computing education, and artificial intelligence education for educators.</p>
<h2 id="section-10">Section 10 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-10">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For any behind the meter energy system project, owned by an emerging large energy use facility, the facility receiving power from the system must ensure that any work associated with such a project will be performed by a prime contractor and its subcontractors in a way that includes community workforce agreements or project labor agreements, and the payment of area standard prevailing wages and apprenticeship utilization requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community workforce agreements and project labor agreements are self-contained, stand-alone agreements, and that by virtue of having become bound to such an agreement or agreements, neither the prime contractor nor the subcontractors are obligated to sign any other local, area, or national agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section supersedes RCW 19.28.091 or 19.28.261.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Project labor agreement&quot; and &quot;community workforce agreement&quot; means a prehire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. Sec. 158(f).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project&quot; means the project labor agreement or community workforce agreement is a single agreement covering all labor organizations representing the building and construction employees involved in the project and covering all contractors and subcontractors working on the project.</p>
