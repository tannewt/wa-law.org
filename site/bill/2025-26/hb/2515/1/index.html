<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that data centers are emerging large energy use facilities that have the potential to significantly affect Washington's energy affordability and reliability, local communities, jobs, environment, and economy.</p>
<p>Data centers are projected to grow rapidly over the next several years, making up the largest source of expected electricity load growth in the Pacific Northwest. The legislature established tax incentives for data centers starting in 2010. However, since that time, the data center industry has undergone major changes. Data centers are growing larger to support artificial intelligence, and there is high uncertainty about many aspects of the future of this rapidly evolving, emerging industry.</p>
<p>The development of data centers has brought benefits including construction jobs and significant new tax revenues to Washington, especially to rural communities. Data centers are also major users of electricity, water, and refrigerant chemicals, though information about data center resource use and environmental impacts is difficult if not impossible for the public to access.</p>
<p>The legislature intends to enact policies governing these emerging large energy use facilities, currently defined as data centers and cryptocurrency facilities, while recognizing that other such industries may emerge in the future with their facilities requiring similar policies.</p>
<p>For emerging large energy use facilities, the legislature's policy priorities are affordability, grid reliability, transparency, and environmental protection. The legislature intends to protect energy affordability for consumers; ensure that data center energy demands do not harm the reliability of the electric grid; require transparency about energy, water, and refrigerant use; and require the use of 100 percent clean energy over time.</p>
<p>The technology industry plays an important role in Washingtonians' lives and in the state's economy. The legislature intends to require data centers to meet a high standard for performance, building on the industry's ability to innovate and lead, while protecting and delivering benefits to Washington consumers, workers, communities, and environment.</p>

<p>The emerging large energy use facility account is created in the state treasury. All receipts from emerging large energy use facilities as authorized in section 8 of this act must be deposited in the account. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Sixty percent of the expenditures from the account must be used for energy assistance, weatherization, low-income home electrification, and related readiness upgrade purposes, which may include the following programs administered by the department of commerce: The low-income residential weatherization program as described in chapter 70A.35 RCW, the state home energy assistance program, and the low-income home rehabilitation grant program as described in chapter 43.330 RCW. It is the intent of the legislature for these funds to add to rather than supplant or reduce other state investments for these purposes. Forty percent of the expenditures from the account must be appropriated to the student achievement council to distribute to public institutions of higher education as defined in chapter 28B.10 RCW for the following higher education purposes: Career services, quantum computing education, and artificial intelligence education for educators.</p>
