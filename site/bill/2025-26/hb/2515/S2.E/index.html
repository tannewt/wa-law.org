<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that data centers are emerging large energy use facilities that have the potential to significantly affect Washington's energy affordability and reliability, local communities, jobs, environment, and economy.</p>
<p>Data centers are projected to grow rapidly over the next several years, making up the largest source of expected electricity load growth in the Pacific Northwest. The legislature established tax incentives for data centers in 2010 and updated these incentives in 2022. However, since that time, the data center industry has undergone major changes. Data centers are growing larger to support artificial intelligence, and there is high uncertainty about many aspects of the future of this rapidly evolving, emerging industry.</p>
<p>The development of data centers has brought benefits including construction jobs and significant new tax revenues to Washington, especially to rural communities. Data centers are also major users of electricity, water, and refrigerant chemicals.</p>
<p>The legislature intends to enact policies governing these emerging large energy use facilities. For these emerging large energy use facilities, the legislature's policy priorities are affordability, grid reliability, transparency, and environmental protection. The legislature intends to protect energy affordability for consumers; ensure that data center energy demands do not harm the reliability of the electric grid; require transparency about energy, water, and refrigerant use; and require the use of 100 percent clean energy over time.</p>
<p>The technology industry plays an important role in Washingtonians' lives and in the state's economy. The legislature intends to require data centers to meet a high standard for performance, building on the industry's ability to innovate and lead, while protecting and delivering benefits to Washington consumers, workers, communities, and environment.</p>

This allocation must be consistent with a forecast, that is approved by the appropriate governing board or the utilities and transportation commission, of each utility's supply and demand, and the cost burden resulting from the inclusion of the covered entities in the compliance periods. The rule developed under this subsection (2)(d) may prescribe an amount of allowances allocated at no cost that must be consigned to auction by consumer-owned and investor-owned electric utilities. However, utilities may use allowances for compliance equal to their covered emissions in any calendar year they were not subject to potential penalty under RCW 19.405.090. Under no circumstances may utilities receive any free allowances after 2045.</p>

<li>
<p>By October 1, 2026, the department, in consultation with the department of commerce and the utilities and transportation commission, must adopt rules governing the amount of allowances allocated at no cost under subsection (2)(c) of this section that must be consigned to auction.

<p>The benefits of all allowances consigned to auction under this section must be used by consumer-owned and investor-owned electric utilities for the benefit of ratepayers, with the first priority the mitigation of any rate impacts to low-income customers.

<p>The department shall allow for allowances to be transferred between a power marketing administration and electric utilities and used for direct compliance.</p>

<p>A consumer-owned utility that is party to a contract that meets the following conditions must be issued allowances under this section for emissions associated with imported electricity, in order to prevent impairment of the value of the contract to either party:</p>

<li>
<p>The contract does not address compliance costs imposed upon the consumer-owned utility by the program created in this chapter; and</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>By July 31st each year, starting in calendar year 2026, each utility must provide to the department a list of existing and forecast retail customers that are emerging large energy use facilities to enable the department to provide allowance allocation consistent with subsection (1) of this section. For each facility the utility must indicate the forecast maximum delivery of power to the facility for the following four years, forecast annual retail load in megawatt-hours for the following four years, customer name, and facility type.

<p>(A) Thirty-five family wage employment positions; or, if lower</p>
<p>(B) Three family wage employment positions for each 20,000 square feet of space or less that is newly dedicated to housing working servers at the eligible computer data center. For qualifying tenants, the number of family wage employment positions that must be increased under this subsection (3)(a)(i)(B) is based only on the space occupied by the qualifying tenant in the eligible computer data center.</p>
<pre><code>    ii. After the minimum number of family wage employment positions as required under (a)(i) of this subsection (3) is established, a qualifying business or a qualifying tenant must maintain the minimum family wage employment positions required under (a)(i) of this subsection (3) while the exemption certificate is valid.

b. In calculating the net increase in family wage employment positions:

    i. The owner of an eligible computer data center, in addition to its own net increase in family wage employment positions, may include:

<p>(B) The portion of the net increase in family wage employment positions to be counted under (b)(ii) of this subsection (3) by each qualifying tenant is equal to the net increase in family wage employment positions assigned to an eligible computer data center as described in (b)(ii)(A)(I) and (II) of this subsection (3), multiplied by the percentage of total space within the eligible computer data center occupied by the qualifying tenant.

<p>(C) In the instance of an existing data center facility that was ineligible, regardless of the date of commencement of construction, that later obtains an exemption certificate under this section, the data center may count the existing employment positions that are dedicated to the data center toward the new family wage employment position requirements if the employment positions meet the requirements of a family wage employment position, as described in (c)(i)(A) of this subsection (3), other than the requirement that the position did not exist or had not previously been filled as of the date that the department issued an exemption certificate.</p>

The per capita personal income to be used to determine qualification for any year is the amount that was established for the immediate prior year.</p>
<p>(II) An employment position may not be counted as a family wage employment position unless the employment position is entitled to health insurance coverage provided by the employer of the employment position.</p>
<p>(B) &quot;New permanent employment position&quot; means an employment position that did not exist or that had not previously been filled as of the date that the department issued an exemption certificate to the qualifying business or qualifying tenant of an eligible computer data center, as the case may be, except as provided in (b)(ii)(C) of this subsection (3).</p>
<pre><code>    ii.(A) Family wage employment positions include positions filled by employees of the qualifying business and by employees of qualifying tenants.

<p>(B) Family wage employment positions also include individuals performing work at an eligible computer data center as an independent contractor hired by the owner of the eligible computer data center or as an employee of an independent contractor hired by the owner of the eligible computer data center, if the work is necessary for the operation of the computer data center, such as security and building maintenance, and provided that all of the applicable requirements in (c) of this subsection (3) are met.</p>

    ii. The department of labor and industries must, at the request of the department, assist in determining whether the requirements of this subsection (3) have been met.

    iii. If the department, with the assistance of the department of labor and industries, finds that a failure to meet the requirements of this subsection (3) is due to circumstances beyond the control of the qualifying business or qualifying tenant including, but not limited to, a declaration of an economic recession, pandemic, or natural disaster affecting data center operations, the department may provide exceptions or extensions to the requirements of this subsection (3).

    iv. Any repayment of taxes triggered by the failure of a qualifying business or qualifying tenant to meet the requirements of this subsection (3) must be calculated in proportion to the duration of time for which any applicable requirement was not met.
