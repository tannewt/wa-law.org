<p>The aged, blind, or disabled assistance program shall provide financial grants to persons in need who:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Are not eligible to receive supplemental security income, refugee cash assistance, temporary assistance for needy families, or state family assistance benefits;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meet the eligibility requirements of subsection (3) of this section; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are aged, blind, or disabled. For purposes of determining eligibility for assistance for the aged, blind, or disabled assistance program, the following definitions apply:</p>
</li>
</ol>

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) &quot;Aged&quot; means age 65 or older.</p>
<p>(B) &quot;Blind&quot; means statutorily blind as defined for the purpose of determining eligibility for the federal supplemental security income program.</p>
<p>(C) &quot;Disabled&quot; means likely to meet the federal supplemental security income disability standard. In making this determination, the department should give full consideration to the cumulative impact of an applicant's multiple impairments, an applicant's age, and vocational and educational history.</p>
<p>In determining whether a person is disabled, the department may rely on, but is not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>(I) A previous disability determination by the social security administration or the disability determination service entity within the department; or</p>
<p>(II) A determination that an individual is eligible to receive optional categorically needy medicaid as a disabled person under the federal regulations at 42 C.F.R. Parts 435, Secs. 201(a)(3) and 210.</p>
<pre><code>b. The following persons are not eligible for the aged, blind, or disabled assistance program:

    i. Persons who are not able to engage in gainful employment due primarily to a substance use disorder. These persons shall be referred to appropriate assessment, treatment, or shelter services. Referrals shall be made at the time of application or at the time of eligibility review. This subsection may not be construed to prohibit the department from granting aged, blind, or disabled assistance benefits to persons with a substance use disorder who are incapacitated due to other physical or mental conditions that meet the eligibility criteria for the aged, blind, or disabled assistance program; or

    ii. Persons for whom there has been a final determination of ineligibility based on age, blindness, or disability for federal supplemental security income benefits.

c. Persons may receive aged, blind, or disabled assistance benefits and essential needs and housing program support under RCW 43.185C.220 concurrently while pending application for federal supplemental security income benefits. Effective October 1, 2028, a person's receipt of supplemental security income received for the same period as aged, blind, or disabled program assistance as described in this section shall not be considered a debt due to the state and is not subject to recovery. However, the monetary value of aged, blind, or disabled cash assistance paid prior to October 1, 2028, that is duplicated by the person's receipt of supplemental security income for the same period shall be considered a debt due to the state and shall by operation of law be subject to recovery through all available legal remedies.
