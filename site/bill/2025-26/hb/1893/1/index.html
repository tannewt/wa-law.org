<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Any person injured by an individual who was previously arrested for a violent offense, and subsequently released from custody before trial for such offense as a result of a superior, district, or municipal court judge declining to impose reasonable bail as a condition of release, has a cause of action against such judge if: (a) The individual caused the injury after being released from custody; and (b) the judge failed to adequately consider the risk of public harm that could result from the individual's release before trial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;violent offense&quot; has the same meaning as defined in RCW 9.94A.030.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, adequate consideration requires:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A written and published assessment that analyzes:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>All known evidence about the individual's alleged violent offense, criminal record, and risk of engaging in further violence;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vulnerability of anyone the individual has previously victimized or is likely to victimize in the future; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The adequacy of alternatives to pretrial detention for mitigating the risk the individual may cause harm to others if he or she is released before trial; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consideration of all relevant and reasonably available evidence, including public records, and the testimony of law enforcement officials and experts and crime victims and crime victim advocates.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, whether the bail imposed was reasonable is a question of fact and requires consideration of the totality of the circumstances known to the judge who imposed the bail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No form of judicial immunity may be raised as an immunity or defense to any action brought under this section, including without limitation any immunity or defense premised on the argument that a judge has absolute immunity from suits in tort that arise from acts performed within their judicial capacity or jurisdiction, or that immunity is warranted or necessary to protect the administration of justice or independent and impartial decision making.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In an action brought under this section, the court shall award to a prevailing plaintiff actual damages as determined by the trier of fact, and shall make an award of at least nominal damages. The court may also award to a prevailing plaintiff costs and reasonable attorneys' fees. The court may grant declaratory and injunctive relief as it deems appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, nothing in this section is intended to limit the right of an elected or appointed official to have a legal defense provided at the expense of the state or a political subdivision of the state, or to have any judgment under this section satisfied by the state or a political subdivision of the state under chapter 4.92 or 4.96 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever a claim is brought under this section, if the trier of fact finds by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly disregarded the risk of public harm when the defendant declined to impose reasonable bail, then:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The defendant shall be personally liable for all costs of defense and judgment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state and any political subdivision of the state must not pay any of the defendant's subsequent costs of defense or judgment; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any costs of defense the state or any political subdivision of the state has previously paid must be repaid by the defendant within one year of entry of judgment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A cause of action under this section must be commenced within three years after the cause of action accrues. For the purpose of this section, a cause of action accrues when the plaintiff discovers, or in the reasonable exercise of diligence should discover, the elements of the cause of action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section must be liberally construed to effect its beneficial and remedial purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section affects any other common law or statutory right of action available to a plaintiff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section applies only to causes of action arising on or after the effective date of this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
