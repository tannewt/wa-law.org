<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that affordable employer-specific worker training not only helps businesses but also improves the quality of life for workers and communities. The legislature also finds that 75 percent of participating businesses completed customized training under the program created in RCW 28B.67.020 and repaid the customized employment training program training allowance, a performance threshold identified by the 67th legislature as satisfactory to extend the expiration date of the tax credit established in RCW 82.04.449. It is the intent of the legislature to aid in attracting and retaining jobs in Washington by extending the expiration of the customized employment training program tax credit to July 1, 2031.</p>
