# HB 1607 - Recycling & waste reduction

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1607-S3.pdf)

## Section 101
The legislature finds that Washington's current recycling system does not collect and recycle the majority of the 3,800,000,000 glass, plastic, and metal beverage containers put onto the market each year to their highest and best use in order to optimize the economic and environmental benefits of recycling for Washington residents.

The legislature recognizes improved recycling for beverage containers will help the state to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce litter and specifically plastic pollution, expand opportunities for reusable containers, and support state and regional businesses to build a circular economy. Higher-quality materials always hold greater economic value and offer more diverse end markets. The recent struggles of regional end markets expose critical weaknesses in Washington's fragmented recycling system and underscore the urgent need for comprehensive reforms to divert recyclable materials, like glass, from landfills and ensure they are transformed into valuable new products. Recycling refund programs provide a proven solution by delivering high quality, source separated glass, plastic, and metal containers that will revitalize end markets and support robust local recycling infrastructure.

The legislature finds that by enacting a recycling refund program for glass, plastic, and metal beverage containers within an extended producer responsibility framework has been shown to be the most effective method for the recovery, reuse, and recycling of beverage containers and all packaging waste. By increasing recovery rates for beverage containers, these systems will help companies who manufacture these products meet recycled content goals and reduce their environmental footprint.

Recycling refund programs in other states have proven to drive up recycling rates by providing a direct financial incentive for residents to return used containers. In addition, these systems also have proven to reduce litter. Packaging pollution remains a significant issue in Washington, with over 2,000,000,000 pounds of packaging materials being landfilled, 11,600,000 pounds of litter entering public parks annually, and more than 26,000,000 pounds of litter accumulating along roadsides. Despite spending $12,000,000 annually on cleanup efforts, only a fraction of the problem is addressed. In contrast, states with recycling refund programs have reported reductions in beverage container litter by up to 84 percent, while achieving recovery rates for plastic bottles that are 3.5 times higher than states without such programs, an essential step in preventing ocean plastics and other environmental harm.

The legislature intends for recycling refunds to play a pivotal role in contributing to cleaner communities, a healthier recycling ecosystem, and stronger domestic manufacturing and circular economy.

## Section 201
1. The legislature finds that, as of 2025:

    a. Washington's statewide waste recovery rate has been generally static since 2011 and Washington is not meeting the statewide goal of 50 percent recycling established in 1989; and

    b. Many residents, particularly those who live in rural areas and in multifamily residences, do not have access to convenient or affordable curbside recycling, and must rely on taking recyclables to drop box locations, and that extended producer responsibility programs could make curbside recycling available and affordable for most people in the state.

2. [Empty]

    a. It is the intent of the legislature to require extended producer responsibility programs for consumer packaging and paper products to be implemented in a manner that involves producers in material management from design concept to end of life.

    b. It is intended that these programs be responsibly planned and funded in a manner that minimizes negative impacts to the environment and minimizes risks to public health and worker health and safety. It is also intended that these programs build and expand on the existing waste and recycling system's infrastructure and reliance on the authority of local governments and the utilities and transportation commission in solid waste management.

    c. It is the intent of the legislature that Washington should maintain the successful public-private partnership between state, local government, and solid waste and recycling service providers. The legislature does not intend to diminish or displace the primary role of the utilities and transportation commission and local governments in regulating or contracting directly with service providers for the curbside collection of residential recyclables. Local governments maintain their existing authority to collect, contract for collection with solid waste and recycling service providers, or defer to solid waste collection services regulated by the utilities and transportation commission.

3. It is the intent of the legislature for the 2029 legislature to consider the draft plans submitted by producer responsibility organizations to the department of ecology in October 2028, prior to the approval of such plans by the department of ecology taking effect. It is the intent of the legislature for the 2029 legislature to consider the draft plans submitted in October 2028 and the independent analysis carried out by January 2029, of those submitted draft plans, in order for the 2029 legislature to determine whether to amend the requirements of this chapter, to make other recycling policy changes , or to allow that the proposed plan and program under this chapter be implemented in full.

## Section 202
1. The advisory council is established to review all activities conducted by producer responsibility organizations under this chapter and to advise the department and producer responsibility organizations regarding the implementation of this chapter.

2. By January 1, 2026, the department must establish and appoint the initial membership of the advisory council. The membership of the advisory council must consist of the following:
