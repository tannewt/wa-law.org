    c. A political subdivision where, for members of a protected class consisting of at least 6,000 citizens of voting age or whose members comprise at least 15 percent of the citizen voting age population of the political subdivision, at any point during the previous 10 years, the combined misdemeanor and felony arrest rate of that protected class is more than two times that of the whole population of the political subdivision;

## Section 2
1. [Empty]

    a. Prior to adopting or administering a covered practice as defined in section 1 of this act, the governing body of a covered jurisdiction shall:

        i. Institute an action in Thurston county superior court or, if the jurisdiction is located within Thurston county, institute an action in King county superior court, for a declaratory judgment certifying that the covered practice meets the standard in (b) of this subsection; or

        ii. Submit such covered practice to the attorney general for issuance of a certification of no objection to the proposed covered practice.

    b. The superior court shall issue the declaratory judgment or, if applicable, the attorney general shall issue a certification of no objection, only if the proposed covered practice:

        i. Will not diminish the ability of the protected class or classes that are the basis for the political subdivision's designation as a covered jurisdiction to participate in the political process or to elect their preferred candidates to office; and

        ii. Does not violate chapter 29A.92 RCW, the federal voting rights act, 52 U.S.C. Sec. 10301 et seq., or other provisions of state or federal law.

2. No covered practice is effective until the superior court has entered a declaratory judgment certifying that the covered practice meets the standard in subsection (1)(b) of this section or the attorney general has issued a certification of no objection.

3. [Empty]

    a. A certification of no objection may be deemed to have been issued if:

        i. After submitting a covered policy for a certification with the attorney general, the attorney general does not issue an objection within 60 days of the governing body's submission of the covered policy, except when the timeline is extended pursuant to (b) of this subsection; or

        ii. The attorney general affirmatively indicates that no such objection will be made, upon a showing of good cause to facilitate an expedited approval within 60 days of the governing body's submission.

    b. The attorney general may, no more than twice, extend the number of days to issue an objection under (a) of this subsection by 90 days for each extension.

    c. If the attorney general affirmatively indicates that no objection will be made within the 60-day period following the receipt of the governing body's submission, the attorney general may reserve the right to reexamine the submission if the attorney general discovers additional information during the remainder of the 60-day period that would otherwise require an objection in accordance with this section. Upon reexamination, the attorney general may extend the number of days to issue an objection in accordance with (b) of this subsection.

    d. An affirmative indication by the attorney general that no objection will be made, the attorney general's failure to object, or a declaratory judgment entered by the superior court certifying that the covered practice meets the standard in subsection (1)(b) of this section does not bar a subsequent action to enjoin enforcement of the covered practice.

4. Except as provided under section 5 of this act, the attorney general may institute an action in superior court of the county in which the relevant political subdivision is located or in the Thurston county superior court to enjoin a covered jurisdiction from implementing a covered practice and to compel the governing body of the covered jurisdiction to comply with the requirements under subsection (1) of this section.

5. If the attorney general objects to a covered practice submitted by a covered jurisdiction, the covered jurisdiction may appeal the objection in superior court of the county in which the relevant political subdivision is located or in the Thurston county superior court. No other parties may file an action to appeal an objection by the attorney general to a covered practice nor intervene in any such action brought by the covered jurisdiction. Due to the frequency and urgency of elections, actions brought pursuant to this section shall be subject to expedited proceedings.

6. In any action under this section, the court has discretion to stay the implementation of the covered practice until it issues its final order or determination. An action under this subdivision does not preclude, bar, or limit any other actions that may be brought regarding the covered policy in any way, including actions brought under other sections of chapter 29A.92 RCW.

## Section 3
1. Except as provided under section 5 of this act, an action may be filed by any aggrieved party in any of the following circumstances:

    a. The attorney general has issued a certification of no objection to a covered policy in violation of section 2 of this act;

    b. The secretary of state has identified a list of covered jurisdictions that is inconsistent with the criteria under section 1 of this act, including the failure to designate a covered jurisdiction that meets the criteria under section 1 of this act; or

    c. To compel the governing body of the covered jurisdiction to institute an action for a declaratory judgment or to seek issuance of a certification of no objection from the attorney general prior to adopting or implementing the covered practice.

2. An action to appeal the attorney general's certificate of no objection must be filed in superior court of the county in which the relevant political subdivision is located or in the Thurston county superior court.

3. In any claim under this section, the court has discretion to stay the implementation of the covered practice until it issues its final order or determination. A claim under this subdivision does not preclude, bar, or limit any other claims that may be brought regarding the covered policy in any way, including claims brought under other sections of chapter 29A.92 RCW. Review of the attorney general's determination under subsection (1)(a) of this section is de novo.

4. For purposes of this section, an "aggrieved person" may include any organization whose:

    a. Membership includes individuals aggrieved by a violation of this section; or

    b. Mission would be frustrated by a violation of this section, including but not limited to an entity who would expend or divert resources to fulfill its mission as a result of such violation.

5. An organization described under subsection (4) of this section may not be compelled to disclose the identity of any specific member to pursue a claim on behalf of its members.

## Section 4
1. No later than July 1st of each even-numbered year, the secretary of state shall by rule and in consultation with the attorney general, the office of financial management, and other relevant agencies, designate those political subdivisions which qualify as covered jurisdictions pursuant to section 1 of this act based on the best available data from the United States census bureau, the most recent American community survey, or other data of comparable quality collected by a federal, state, or local agency. The secretary of state shall provide written notice to the covered jurisdiction of the designation. A determination made pursuant to this subsection is effective on the date that the written notice is sent.

2. The office of the attorney general shall maintain a publicly accessible website containing the following information:

    a. A list of all covered jurisdictions, to be updated biannually;

    b. All submissions for a certificate of no objection and actions filed in superior court for a declaratory judgment certifying that the covered practice meets the standard in section 2 of this act, including any supporting documents submitted by the covered entity; and

    c. The status and disposition of each submission under (b) of this subsection.

## Section 5
Once a covered practice is approved by the attorney general or a court pursuant to section 2 of this act, an action against the political subdivision based on the same covered practice may not be brought within four years of the approval of that covered practice so long as the political subdivision does not enact a change to or deviation from the approved covered practice during the four-year period that would otherwise give rise to an action under this chapter or chapter 29A.92 RCW.
