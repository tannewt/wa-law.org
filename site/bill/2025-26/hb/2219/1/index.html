<li>
<p>Rely on the standards established in the early achievers program to address quality issues in participating early childhood programs;</p>

<p>Take into account the separate needs of family care providers, outdoor nature-based child care providers, and child care centers; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote the continued safety of child care settings.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In establishing the maximum group sizes and staff-to-child ratios for child care centers, the licensing standards established and implemented by the department must allow for the following periods of mixed-ratio time in which children of different age groups may be combined, provided the staff-to-child ratio and group size designated for the youngest child in the mixed group are maintained:</p>

<p>Private schools that operate early learning programs and do not receive state subsidy payments shall be subject to the minimum health and safety standards as defined in RCW 43.216.395(2)(b), the health and safety requirements under chapter 28A.195 RCW, and the requirements necessary to assure a sufficient early childhood education to meet usual requirements needed for transition into elementary school.
