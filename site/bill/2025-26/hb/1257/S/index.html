<p>The legislature finds that, with some exceptions, a state receiving federal funding under the federal individuals with disabilities education act is obligated to provide a free appropriate public education to children with disabilities &quot;between the ages of 3 and 21, inclusive.&quot; However, the state is not obligated to serve youth with disabilities aged 18-21 if it would be inconsistent with state law or practice, or the order of any court, regarding the provision of public education to youth in that age range.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature observes that, under Washington law in effect in 2024, children with disabilities must be provided a free appropriate public education &quot;between the ages of 3 and 21.&quot; When the 21st birthday of an individual with disabilities occurs during the school year, state administrative rule requires that special education services continue until the end of the school year.</p>

<li>
<p>The legislature acknowledges that, on November 22, 2024, the United States district court for the western district of Washington issued an order in the case of N.D. v. Reykdal. This class action lawsuit alleged that Washington's law violates the federal individuals with disabilities education act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The plaintiff students successfully argued that, because Washington offers adult education programs to 21 year olds and waives the $25 tuition fee for those who cannot pay, the state provides &quot;free public education&quot; to nondisabled students through age 21, which makes the federal individuals with disabilities education act's exception inapplicable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court issued a declaratory judgment that Washington's policy of aging students out of special education at the end of the school year in which they turn 21 years old presently violates the federal individuals with disabilities education act and will continue to violate the federal individuals with disabilities education act absent a substantial change in the state's policies for charging and waiving tuition for its adult secondary education programs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that providing services through the school year in which the student turns 22 years old is vital to maximize educational gains, provide transitional supports, and for planning purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For these reasons, when the 22nd birthday of an individual with disabilities occurs during the school year, the legislature intends to continue the provision of special education services until the end of the school year. The legislature does not intend for this extension of special education services to reduce or supplant any other services an individual with disabilities is eligible for.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>By October 30, 2026, the office of the superintendent of public instruction, the department of social and health services, the department of services for the blind, and any other state agency working with individuals with disabilities must collaborate to update the implementation plan for improving transition planning activities for students likely to become eligible for services from the developmental disabilities administration as outlined in section 501(3)(c), chapter 357, Laws of 2020. The updated implementation plan should include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The provision of coordinated transition services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Examples of how coordinated transition services can be provided to students between the ages of 16 and 22 to ensure a seamless transition from school to postschool life; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How transition services are provided in a way that supplements and not supplants state special education funding.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In updating the implementation plan, the state agencies referenced in subsection (1) of this section must consult with nonprofit providers of high school transition services and advocates for students with individualized education programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section expires August 1, 2027.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<p>There is established in the office of the superintendent of public instruction an administrative section or unit for the education of children with disabilities who require special education.</p>
<p>Students with disabilities are those children whether enrolled in school or not who through an evaluation process are determined eligible for special education due to a disability.</p>
<p>In accordance with part B of the federal individuals with disabilities education improvement act and any other federal or state laws relating to the provision of special education services, the superintendent of public instruction shall require each school district in the state to insure an appropriate educational opportunity for all students with disabilities beginning at three years of age and concluding at the end of the school year in which the student turns 22 years of age. The superintendent of public instruction, by rule, shall establish for the purpose of excess cost funding, as provided in RCW 28A.150.390, 28A.160.030, and 28A.155.010 through 28A.155.160, functional definitions of special education, the various types of disabling conditions, and eligibility criteria for special education programs for children with disabilities, including referral procedures, use of positive behavior interventions, the education curriculum and statewide or district‑wide assessments, parent and district requests for special education due process hearings, and procedural safeguards. For the purposes of RCW 28A.155.010 through 28A.155.160, an appropriate education is defined as an education directed to the unique needs, abilities, and limitations of the children with disabilities who are enrolled either full time or part time in a school district. School districts are strongly encouraged to provide parental training in the care and education of the children and to involve parents in the classroom.</p>
<p>Nothing in this section shall prohibit the establishment or continuation of existing cooperative programs between school districts or contracts with other agencies approved by the superintendent of public instruction, which can meet the obligations of school districts to provide education for children with disabilities, or prohibit the continuation of needed related services to school districts by the department of social and health services.</p>
<p>This section shall not be construed as in any way limiting the powers of local school districts set forth in RCW 28A.155.070.</p>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In order for students to have the opportunity to develop the basic education knowledge and skills under RCW 28A.150.210, school districts must provide instruction of sufficient quantity and quality and give students the opportunity to complete graduation requirements that are intended to prepare them for postsecondary education, gainful employment, and citizenship. The program established under this section shall be the minimum instructional program of basic education offered by school districts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each school district shall make available to students the following minimum instructional offering each school year:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>For students enrolled in grades one through 12, at least a district-wide annual average of 1,000 hours, which shall be increased beginning in the 2015-16 school year to at least 1,080 instructional hours for students enrolled in grades nine through 12 and at least 1,000 instructional hours for students in grades one through eight, all of which may be calculated by a school district using a district-wide annual average of instructional hours over grades one through 12; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For students enrolled in kindergarten, at least 450 instructional hours, which shall be increased to at least 1,000 instructional hours according to the implementation schedule under RCW 28A.150.315.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The instructional program of basic education provided by each school district shall include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Instruction in the state learning standards under RCW 28A.655.070;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instruction that provides students the opportunity to complete 24 credits for high school graduation. Course distribution requirements may be established by the state board of education under RCW 28A.230.090;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the state learning standards include a requirement of languages other than English, the requirement may be met by students receiving instruction in one or more American Indian languages;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supplemental instruction and services for students who are not meeting academic standards through the learning assistance program under RCW 28A.165.005 through 28A.165.065;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supplemental instruction and services for eligible and enrolled students and exited students whose primary language is other than English through the transitional bilingual instruction program under RCW 28A.180.010 through 28A.180.080;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The opportunity for an appropriate education at public expense as defined by RCW 28A.155.020 for all eligible students with disabilities as defined in RCW 28A.155.020; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Programs for highly capable students under RCW 28A.185.010 through 28A.185.030.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Except as provided for students with disabilities under RCW 28A.155.020, each school district's kindergarten through 12th grade basic educational program shall be accessible to all students who are five years of age, as provided by RCW 28A.225.160, and less than 21 years of age and shall consist of a minimum of 180 school days per school year in such grades as are conducted by a school district, and 180 half-days of instruction, or equivalent, in kindergarten, to be increased to a minimum of 180 school days per school year according to the implementation schedule under RCW 28A.150.315.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Schools administering the Washington kindergarten inventory of developing skills may use up to three school days at the beginning of the school year to meet with parents and families as required in the parent involvement component of the inventory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of students who are graduating from high school, a school district may schedule the last five school days of the 180-day school year for noninstructional purposes including, but not limited to, the observance of graduation and early release from school upon the request of a student. All such students may be claimed as a full‑time equivalent student to the extent they could otherwise have been so claimed for the purposes of RCW 28A.150.250 and 28A.150.260. Any hours scheduled by a school district for noninstructional purposes during the last five school days for such students shall count toward the instructional hours requirement in subsection (2)(a) of this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to RCW 28A.150.276, nothing in this section precludes a school district from enriching the instructional program of basic education, such as offering additional instruction or providing additional services, programs, or activities that the school district determines to be appropriate for the education of the school district's students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state board of education shall adopt rules to implement and ensure compliance with the program requirements imposed by this section, RCW 28A.150.250 and 28A.150.260, and such related supplemental program approval requirements as the state board may establish.</p>

<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Each school district that operates a high school shall establish a policy and procedures that permit any student who is receiving special education or related services under an individualized education program pursuant to state and federal law  to participate in the graduation ceremony and activities after four years of high school attendance with his or her age-appropriate peers and receive a certificate of attendance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participation in a graduation ceremony and receipt of a certificate of attendance under this section does not preclude a student from continuing to receive special education and related services under an individualized education program beyond the graduation ceremony.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A student's participation in a graduation ceremony and receipt of a certificate of attendance under this section shall not be construed as the student's receipt of a high school diploma pursuant to RCW 28A.230.120.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-6">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction must establish interagency agreements with the department of social and health services, the department of services for the blind, and any other state agency that provides high school transition services for special education students. Such interagency agreements shall not interfere with existing individualized education programs, nor override any individualized education program team's decision-making power. The purpose of the interagency agreements is to foster effective collaboration among the multiple agencies providing transition services for individualized education program-eligible special education students from the beginning of transition planning, as soon as educationally and developmentally appropriate, through the end of the school year in which the student turns 22 years of age, or through high school graduation, whichever occurs first. Interagency agreements are also intended to streamline services and programs, promote efficiencies, and establish a uniform focus on improved outcomes related to self-sufficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>When educationally and developmentally appropriate, the interagency responsibilities and linkages with transition services under subsection (1) of this section must be addressed in a transition plan to a postsecondary setting in the individualized education program of a student with disabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transition planning shall be based upon educationally and developmentally appropriate transition assessments that outline the student's individual needs, strengths, preferences, and interests. Transition assessments may include observations, interviews, inventories, situational assessments, formal and informal assessments, as well as academic assessments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The transition services that the transition plan must address include activities needed to assist the student in reaching postsecondary goals and courses of study to support postsecondary goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transition activities that the transition plan may address include instruction, related services, community experience, employment and other adult living objectives, daily living skills, and functional vocational evaluation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When educationally and developmentally appropriate, a discussion must take place with the student and parents, and others as needed, to determine the postsecondary goals or postschool vision for the student. This discussion may be included as part of an annual individualized education program review, high school and beyond plan meeting, or any other meeting that includes parents, students, and educators. The postsecondary goals included in the transition plan shall be goals that are measurable and must be based on appropriate transition assessments related to training, education, employment, and independent living skills, when necessary. The goals must also be based on the student's needs, while considering the strengths, preferences, and interests of the student.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the student gets older, changes in the transition plan may be noted in the annual update of the student's individualized education program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A transition plan required under this subsection (2) must be aligned with a student's high school and beyond plan.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the extent that data is available through data-sharing agreements established by the education data center under RCW 43.41.400, the education data center must monitor the following outcomes for individualized education program-eligible special education students after high school graduation:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The number of students who, within one year of high school graduation:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Enter integrated employment paid at the greater of minimum wage or competitive wage for the type of employment, with access to related employment and health benefits; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter a postsecondary education or training program focused on leading to integrated employment;</p>

<p>The impact of employment on any state and federal benefits for individuals with disabilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indicators of the types of settings in which students who previously received transition services primarily reside;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indicators of improved economic status and self-sufficiency;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data on those students for whom a postsecondary or integrated employment outcome does not occur within one year of high school graduation, including:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Information on the reasons that the desired outcome has not occurred;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of months the student has not achieved the desired outcome; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The efforts made to ensure the student achieves the desired outcome.</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the extent that the data elements in subsection (3) of this section are available to the education data center through data-sharing agreements, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must prepare an annual report using existing resources and submit the report to the legislature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To minimize gaps in services through the transition process, no later than three years before students receiving special education services leave the school system, the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall transmit a list of potentially eligible students to the department of social and health services, the counties, the department of services for the blind, and any other state agency working with individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall ensure that consent be obtained prior to the release of this information as required in accordance with state and federal requirements.</p>

Except as otherwise provided by law or rules adopted by the superintendent of public instruction, districts may establish uniform entry qualifications, including but not limited to requirements, for admission to kindergarten and first grade programs of the common schools. Such rules may provide for individualized exceptions based upon the ability, or the need, or both, of an individual student.
