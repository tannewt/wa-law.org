<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this act is to protect students from the physically harmful and emotionally traumatic practices of chemical restraint, mechanical restraint, and physical restraint that interfere with breathing or blood flow. By 2031, it is the legislature's intent to improve the safety and well-being of staff members and students in prekindergarten through 12th grade by banning isolation practices, providing technical assistance, implementing a trauma-informed professional development program on evidence-informed alternatives to restraint and isolation, and enhancing the public accountability of school districts and other providers of public educational services.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>1.</p>
<p>The provisions of this section apply to all staff members of school districts and other providers of public educational services, except for staff members who are licensed or certified health professionals of an inpatient health care facility. However, nothing in this section prohibits a school resource officer as defined in RCW 28A.320.124 from carrying out the lawful duties of a commissioned law enforcement officer.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>The provisions of this section apply to all students, including those who have an individualized education program or plan developed under section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973. The provisions of this section apply only to incidents of restraint or isolation that occur while a student is participating in school-sponsored instruction or activities.</p>

<li>
<p>An individualized education program or plan developed under section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 must not include the use of restraint or isolation as a planned behavior intervention except as provided in this subsection (3)(a)(i). Restraint may be included in such program or plan only if the student's individual needs require more specific advanced educational planning, and the student's parent or guardian requests the inclusion of restraint. In all cases in which restraint is included as a planned behavior intervention, a licensed health care provider must document in writing that the intervention is medically necessary, and the parent or guardian must provide informed, voluntary written consent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All other plans may refer to the  policy developed under (b) of this subsection (3).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in (c) of this subsection (3), restraint or isolation of any student is permitted only when reasonably necessary to control spontaneous behavior that poses an imminent likelihood of serious harmto the student or to another person, such as another student or staff member. Restraint or isolation must be closely monitored to prevent harm to the student, and must be discontinued as soon as the likelihood of serious harm has dissipated. Each school district and other provider of public educational services shall adopt a policy providing for the least amount of restraint or isolation appropriate to protect the safety of students and staff members under such circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Staff members of any school district or other provider of public educational services are prohibited from using any of the following restraints on any student: Mechanical restraint; chemical restraint; or physical restraint or physical escort that is life-threatening, restricts breathing, or restricts blood flow to the brain, including prone, supine, and wall restraints.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following the release of a student from the use of restraint or isolation, the school district or other provider of public educational services must implement follow-up procedures. These procedures must include: (a) Reviewing the incident with the student and the parent or guardian to address the behavior that precipitated the restraint or isolation and the appropriateness of the response; and (b) reviewing the incident with the staff member who administered the restraint or isolation to discuss whether proper procedures were followed and what training or support the staff member needs to help the student avoid similar incidents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any staff member who uses isolation or restraint on a student during school-sponsored instruction or activities must inform the building administrator or building administrator's designee as soon as possible, and within two business days submit a written report of the incident to the  office of the school district superintendent or other chief administrator of the provider of public educational services. The written report must include, at a minimum, the following information:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The date and time of the incident;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The name and job title of the staff member who administered the restraint or isolation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A description of the activity that led to the restraint or isolation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The type of restraint or isolation used on the student, including the duration;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the student or staff members were physically injured during the restraint or isolation incident and any medical care provided; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any recommendations for changing the nature or amount of resources available to the student and staff members in order to avoid similar incidents.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The principal , other building administrator, or designee must make a reasonable effort to verbally inform the student's parent or guardian within 24 hours of the incident, and must send written notification as soon as practical but postmarked no later than five business days after the restraint or isolation occurred. If the  school district or other provider of public educational services customarily provides the parent or guardian with school-related information in a language other than English, the written report under this section must be provided to the parent or guardian in that language.</p>

<li>
<p>Annually by January 1st , each school district and other provider of public educational services shall summarize the written reports received under subsection (5) of this section and submit the summaries to the office of the superintendent of public instruction. For each school, the school district or other provider of public educational services shall include the number of individual incidents of restraint and isolation, the number of students involved in the incidents, the number of injuries to students and staff members, and the types of restraint or isolation used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No later than 90 days after receipt, the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall publish to its website the data received under (a) of this subsection (7). The data must be published in a format that enables trend analysis, including comparisons of incident rates and types between school districts and authorized entities as defined in RCW 28A.300.690.
