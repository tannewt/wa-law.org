# HB 1079 - Remote testing

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1079-S.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that students enrolled in online school programs are required to travel to designated testing sites for state assessments. This travel can impose significant burdens on students and families, including requiring parents or guardians to take time off from work, travel long distances, and incur costs for accommodations and meals.

As a result of these burdens, some parents have chosen to excuse their students from taking state assessments. These choices, however, impact the ability of educators and the state to measure the academic progress of these students.

The legislature finds that to ensure equitable access to state assessments and to uphold their integrity, the state must permit remote testing options for students enrolled in online school programs that align with the students' online instruction environments.

The legislature, therefore, intends to expressly permit school districts to offer remote testing options for students enrolled in online education programs to reduce barriers to assessment participation, and maintain fairness, equity, and security in the assessment process.

## Section 2
1. Beginning in the 2027-28 school year, school districts with online school programs may provide all students within those programs with the ability to complete statewide assessments remotely.
