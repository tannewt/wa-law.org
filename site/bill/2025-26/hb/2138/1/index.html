<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that a significant number of Washington's students are struggling to meet grade-level standards in core academic areas. As of 2025, 60 percent of Washington's students are failing to meet grade-level standards in math and 50 percent are failing in English language arts. This persistent underperformance poses a critical challenge to the academic success and future opportunities of Washington's students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that literacy is the foundation upon which all other academic success is built. Yet, concerningly, 36 percent of third grade students and 40 percent of fourth grade students read at below grade level. Learning to read and write is a core element of the state's statutory program of basic education, and these foundational skills are necessary for success in all other subjects. Around the fourth grade, students must transition from &quot;learning to read&quot; to &quot;reading to learn,&quot; where they rely on reading skills to access information in subjects like science and social studies. If students do not achieve strong literacy skills by this critical stage, their ability to succeed academically in all subjects will be severely compromised.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Given these alarming statistics and the importance of early literacy and mathematics skills, the legislature intends to take comprehensive and evidence-based actions to improve student outcomes in reading and math.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In an effort to improve early literacy, the legislature intends to require all students to enter the fourth grade equipped with the reading skills needed to excel in all aspects of their learning. This is a critical juncture in a student's education with far-reaching effects on the student's future academic success. Washington public schools have the potential to significantly improve both academic performance and students' lives, similar to states like Mississippi which, despite having one of the highest populations of low-income students, has achieved remarkable success in reading outcomes by ensuring that students are proficient in reading before advancing to fourth grade. The legislature plans to provide multiple pathways for students to demonstrate proficiency in order to enter fourth grade and intends to allow for good cause exemptions for specific students. However, the legislature believes that, in order to succeed, students must not move to the fourth grade prematurely.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To assist schools in meeting this challenge, the legislature intends to provide for the hiring of reading coaches in elementary schools, ensuring students receive expert guidance in building essential literacy skills. Additionally, by the 2028-29 school year, the legislature intends to require public schools to implement a structured literacy program that aligns with the science of reading, an approach that research shows has an effectiveness rate of at least 95 percent. This program incorporates the five pillars of reading: Phonology and phonemic awareness; orthographic knowledge or phonics; reading and writing fluency; vocabulary or oral language knowledge and proficiency; and semantics or comprehension of written language. The legislature intends to prohibit ineffective methods of instruction and implement programs that are evidence-based, systemic, sequential, and cumulative, ensuring high quality, explicit, and rigorous instruction that meets the diverse needs of all students. To that end, the legislature also intends to provide further resources for teachers to support students with reading difficulties, particularly dyslexia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to require the office of the superintendent of public instruction to monitor school district literacy programs to ensure compliance with these new requirements, facilitating continuous improvement across schools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, the legislature intends to update teacher endorsement standards for reading and literacy. Teacher preparation programs will be required to include these updated standards. To support teachers in the field, the office of the superintendent of public instruction will regularly update training programs and offer refresher courses focused on evidence-based professional development. This training is intended to address the science of reading and the implementation of effective literacy instruction for students in kindergarten through fourth grade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, the legislature intends to call for a review of the state's mathematics standards, specifically including a comparison to Singapore math, to assess whether updating the state's standards could improve outcomes for Washington students in this critical subject area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through these actions, the legislature seeks to ensure that every student in Washington has the foundational skills in literacy and mathematics needed to succeed academically and beyond. These measures align with the state's commitment to providing high quality basic education, addressing the urgent need for intervention and improvement in reading, writing, and mathematics.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall publish longitudinal data on its website regarding public school and school district performance across various student measures. The most recent 10 years of student measures data must be published for the following student measures, at a minimum: Assessment proficiency, graduation rates, assessment growth, enrollment, and discipline. If student measures data is unavailable or lacks sufficient quality for publication, the office must provide an explanation on the relevant webpage.</p>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall consider how the state learning standards in mathematics compare to the mathematics method developed in the country of Singapore that uses a three-step approach, referred to as concrete-pictorial-abstract in order to help students learn math concepts. By December 31, 2026, and in compliance with RCW 43.01.036, the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall report to the appropriate committees of the legislature with a recommendation of whether the state should update its standards to implement the Singapore mathematics method.</p>

If screening tools and resources indicate that, after receiving the initial tier of student support, a student requires interventions, the school district may provide the interventions in either the general education classroom or a learning assistance program setting. If after receiving interventions, further screening tools and resources indicate that a student continues to have indications of, or areas of weakness associated with, dyslexia, the school district must recommend to the student's parents and family that the student be evaluated for dyslexia or a specific learning disability.</p>

<p>For a student who shows indications of, or areas of weakness associated with, dyslexia, each school district must notify the student's parents and family of the identified indicators and areas of weakness, as well as the plan for using a multitiered system of supports to provide supports and interventions. The initial notice must also include the dyslexia handbook developed by the superintendent of public instruction under RCW 28A.300.570. The school district must regularly update the student's parents and family of the student's progress.</p>
