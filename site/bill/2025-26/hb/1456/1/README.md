[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1456.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that Washington state has the lowest number of law enforcement officers per capita in the country with a rate of 1.35 officers per one thousand residents in 2023, down from 1.51 in 2019 and the national average is 2.31 officers per thousand residents. The legislature also finds that during the same time frame of 2019 to 2023, crimes against persons have increased nine percent, property crimes have increased 14 percent, and the number of law enforcement officers assaulted has increased 21 percent. Therefore, the legislature intends to support law enforcement officers and encourage more individuals to be law enforcement officers by restoring reasonable protections from civil liability when performing job duties in accordance with their training, experience, and agency policies, directing the Washington traffic safety commission to coordinate a law enforcement appreciation media campaign, and authorizing law enforcement officers to receive honoraria when giving presentations before higher education classes on criminal justice or forensic science.

## Section 2
It is a complete defense to any action for damages for personal injury or wrongful death that the person injured or killed was engaged in the commission of a felony at the time of the occurrence causing the injury or death and the felony was a proximate cause of the injury or death.

However, nothing in this section shall affect a right of action under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983.

## Section 3

## Section 4
The traffic safety commission using funds appropriated for this specific purpose must develop and implement a law enforcement appreciation media campaign in coordination with a statewide association representing police officers and sheriffs and in consultation with the Washington state patrol. This media campaign is to educate and focus public attention on police officers that have been heroes in their communities, standing between violence and people that would harm others. The goal of the campaign is to let the public know more about how police officers keep people safe in their communities.

## Section 5
1. The legislature finds that involvement by certified law enforcement officers in college programs can help improve the image of law enforcement within the community, create positive interactions with potential recruits, and inspire individuals to consider a career in law enforcement. A law enforcement officer's duties do not include any obligation to interact with college programs in such a manner.

2. An institution of higher education, as defined in RCW 28B.10.016, may engage a general authority Washington peace officer, as defined in RCW 10.93.020, or an officer employed by the state parks and recreation commission, to do a presentation as part of a criminal justice associate, law enforcement, police science, financial forensics and fraud, or forensic science and technology course and pay an honorarium. Such payment is only appropriate when the presentation occurs outside of his or her official duties.

## Section 6
Sheriffs and deputy sheriffs may make presentations and receive honorarium in accordance with section 5 of this act.

## Section 7
1. Washington state patrol officers may engage in private law enforcement off-duty employment, in uniform or in plainclothes for private benefit, subject to guidelines adopted by the chief of the Washington state patrol. These guidelines must ensure that the integrity and professionalism of the Washington state patrol is preserved. Use of Washington state patrol officer's uniforms shall be considered de minimis use of state property.
