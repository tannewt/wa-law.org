<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that high quality early learning is the best way to ensure children have the social-emotional skills and other skills they need to enter kindergarten ready to learn. Unfortunately, too many children across the state do not have access to high quality early learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that the early childhood education and assistance program, the state's preschool program, is expanding and will become an entitlement for eligible children in the year 2026. The fair start for kids act, enacted in 2021, is helping to expand access to more affordable, high quality child care; and early learning and federal early learning programs serve thousands of families across the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, the legislature finds that these early learning programs do not yet reach all families in need. As a result, there are children about to enter kindergarten who need an opportunity for high quality preschool in order to be successful kindergarten students in the following school year. The legislature recognizes that school districts, especially those in communities with early learning deserts, can and do reach children who need these opportunities. Some school districts and charter schools have attempted to address this gap by creating programs referred to as transitional kindergarten using allocations appropriated for the state's program of basic education. These extrastatutory programs are established by school districts and charter schools on an ad hoc basis and not all of the programs referred to as transitional kindergarten meet the high quality age-appropriate early learning standards that other state-funded early learning programs are required to meet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to establish a transition to kindergarten program that meets early learning standards in lieu of transitional kindergarten programs and to help fill in gaps in access to high quality early learning for eligible children, especially in early learning deserts. School district transitional kindergarten programs in operation in 2025 will be converted to school district transition to kindergarten programs for eligible students by August 31, 2026, provided that the standards set forth in this act are met. The legislature intends to provide state funding, which is separate from and in addition to the state basic education allocation, for the transition to kindergarten program so that it can be offered at no charge to eligible students, and to prohibit the use of state basic education allocations for this program. The legislature further intends to clarify that these transition to kindergarten programs, which are offered at the school district's option, are not part of the state's required minimum instructional program of basic education and do not constitute enrollments for purposes of generating state basic education funding allocations. The legislature also intends to: Require that the early learning ecosystem work together; promote coordinated systems of comprehensive early learning services; maximize efficient use of state, federal, and local resources; and ensure that children and families get the early learning services they need in the most appropriate setting.</p>

<li>
<p>Establishment.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The transition to kindergarten program is established to assist eligible children in need of additional preparation to be successful kindergarten students in the following school year. The transition to kindergarten program is not part of the state's instructional program of basic education under RCW 28A.150.220.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall administer the transition to kindergarten program as required by this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authorizations and approvals. The office of the superintendent of public instruction may authorize school districts to offer a transition to kindergarten program, approve transition to kindergarten program sites at one or more of an authorized school district's schools, and cap eligible child enrollment for each authorized school district as required by this subsection (2). The office of the superintendent of public instruction must authorize any school district offering a program referred to as transitional kindergarten during the 2025-26 school year that is converting to a transition to kindergarten program under the conversion plan adopted by the office of the superintendent of public instruction under section 3 of this act, provided the school district meets the requirements of subsection (3) of this section by September 1, 2026, or earlier if required by the office.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>By December 31, 2025, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must develop and begin implementing a process for school districts to apply to operate or expand a transition to kindergarten program. At a minimum, the application must:</p>
<ol type="i">

<p>Specify the number of transition to kindergarten program sites the school district is applying for and the intended number of eligible children to be enrolled at each site;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe the screening process or other instruments that the school district will use to individually determine whether an eligible child has a developmental delay or otherwise needs additional preparation to be successful in kindergarten in the following school year. Eligible children who are on the waitlist for early childhood education and assistance program sites are not required to be screened; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outline the school district's plan for coordinated recruitment and enrollment with other early learning program providers, including its proposed memoranda of understanding.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>

<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>In order to distribute high quality early learning programs across communities in an equitable and effective manner, the following activities must be coordinated with the department of children, youth, and families, in consideration of the items listed in (b)(ii) of this subsection (2): Authorization of school districts to offer a transition to kindergarten program; approval of transition to kindergarten program sites at one or more of an authorized school district's schools; and capping eligible child enrollment. In addition, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must limit the number of authorized school districts, approved transition to kindergarten program sites, and enrolled eligible children as required by the omnibus operating appropriations act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The activities listed in (b)(i) of this subsection (2) must be conducted in consideration of: The existing availability of the early childhood education and assistance programs, head start programs, and licensed child care providers; planned expansion of early childhood education and assistance program sites and eligibility criteria; and the state-funded early childhood education and assistance program entitlement required in RCW 43.216.556.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operations. Authorized school districts operating a transition to kindergarten program must meet the requirements in this subsection (3).</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Except for school districts offering a program referred to as transitional kindergarten during the 2025-26 school year that are converting to a transition to kindergarten program under the conversion plan adopted by the office of the superintendent of public instruction under section 3 of this act, authorized school districts must engage in a planning year before operating a transition to kindergarten program site, during which it must prepare for compliance with applicable rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authorized school districts may not charge tuition or other fees to state-funded eligible children for enrollment in a transition to kindergarten program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authorized school districts must avoid adversely impacting enrollment in other high quality early learning programs by using a coordinated recruitment and enrollment plan to prioritize eligible children for enrollment in the transition to kindergarten program in the following order:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Eligible children on the waitlist for, but not scheduled for enrollment in, an early childhood education and assistance program site; then</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eligible children who have been individually determined through a screening process or other instruments to have a developmental delay or otherwise need additional preparation to be successful in kindergarten in the following school year with priority to the eldest children and the children with the lowest household incomes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authorized school districts must participate in the early achievers program established under RCW 43.216.085.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authorized school districts must require that transition to kindergarten program sites use developmentally appropriate curricula and implement the following elements in alignment with early childhood education and assistance program performance standards: Classroom environment; pedagogical approach; and safety measures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each transition to kindergarten program classroom must be staffed with a teacher who holds a valid Washington teacher certificate and who either:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Holds an early childhood education endorsement or an early childhood special education endorsement; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holds an elementary education endorsement and, within five years of initial assignment to the transition to kindergarten program, completes at least 24 college credits, or 60 clock hours, related to the state early childhood education core competencies established by the department of children, youth, and families.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authorized school districts are prohibited from establishing a policy of excluding an eligible child due only to the presence of a disability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authorized school districts must work in collaboration with early learning partners to promote coordinated systems of comprehensive early childhood services.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>Nothing in this section prohibits authorized school districts from blending or colocating early learning programs, such as the transition to kindergarten program, the early childhood education and assistance program, the federal head start program, or private pay programs.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Funding.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction must distribute to authorized school districts an amount per eligible child enrolled in a transition to kindergarten program that is equivalent to the amount per child enrolled in a school day class of an early childhood education and assistance program, divided by 1.091, and multiplied by the school district's regionalization factor under RCW 28A.150.412 identified in the omnibus appropriations act, excluding the experience factor. The distributed amount must be prorated to account for enrollment in a transition to kindergarten program that is less than a full school day or a full school year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction must submit to the legislature by each December 1st a report that includes the following data: (i) The number of state-funded eligible children enrolled in transition to kindergarten programs operated by authorized school districts in the current school year; and (ii) the estimated number of eligible children that authorized school districts intend to enroll in the following school year.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reapprovals and reauthorizations. The office of the superintendent of public instruction must establish processes to reapprove transition to kindergarten program sites and reauthorize school districts, periodically and, at a minimum, as required in the omnibus operating appropriations act. If an authorized school district or approved transition to kindergarten program site will be discontinued or otherwise not provided with state funding, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must provide the authorized school district with at least one year of notice. If an authorized school district is required to complete remedial activities under section 9 of this act, the initiation of the remedial period serves as the one year of notice that the authorized school district or approved transition to kindergarten program site will be discontinued or otherwise not provided with state funding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resources. The office of the superintendent of public instruction must collaborate with the department of children, youth, and families to develop, and make publicly available, a model memorandum of understanding between authorized school districts and other early learning program providers. The model language must include a process for resolving local concerns between early learning program providers, including school districts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rules. The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall adopt rules under chapter 34.05 RCW for the authorization of, the administration of, and the allocation of state funding for the transition to kindergarten program.

<ol>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section and otherwise provided by law, it is the general policy of the state that the common schools shall be open to the admission of all persons who are five years of age and less than 21 years residing in that school district. Except as otherwise provided by law or rules adopted by the superintendent of public instruction, districts may establish uniform entry qualifications, including but not limited to birthdate requirements, for admission to kindergarten and first grade programs of the common schools. Such rules may provide for individualized exceptions based upon the ability, or the need, or both, of an individual student. Nothing in this section authorizes school districts, public schools, or the superintendent of public instruction to create state-funded programs based on entry qualification exceptions except as otherwise expressly provided by law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purpose of complying with any rule adopted by the superintendent of public instruction that authorizes a preadmission screening process as a prerequisite to granting individualized exceptions to the uniform entry qualifications, a school district may collect fees to cover expenses incurred in the administration of any preadmission screening process: PROVIDED, That in so establishing such fee or fees, the district shall adopt rules for waiving and reducing such fees in the cases of those persons whose families, by reason of their low income, would have difficulty in paying the entire amount of such fees. Beginning with the 2026-27 school year, rules providing for exceptions to the uniform entry qualifications for kindergarten must limit early kindergarten admission to children deemed by the local educational service district, using multiple objective criteria, to be &quot;likely to be successful in kindergarten.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A student who meets the definition of a child of a military family in transition under Article II of RCW 28A.705.010 shall be permitted to continue enrollment at the grade level in the common schools commensurate with the grade level of the student when attending school in the sending state as defined in Article II of RCW 28A.705.010, regardless of age or birthdate requirements.</p>
