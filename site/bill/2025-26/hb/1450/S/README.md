# HB 1450 - Transition to kindergarten

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1450-S.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature intends to support eligible four year old children who either need additional preparation for kindergarten or who are living in extreme child care access deserts and, despite qualifying, do not have access to state or federal early learning or child care programs by establishing a state transition to kindergarten policy that supports students, families, and communities.

In 2023, the legislature attempted to manage an exception to the uniform entry qualifications for kindergarten that had been turned into a basic education program referred to as the transitional kindergarten program by: Continuing and renaming the program as the transition to kindergarten program; using nonbasic education allocations to fund the program; and directing the office of the superintendent of public instruction to adopt rules for school districts, charter schools, and state-tribal education compact schools operating a program.

The legislature now finds that the public policy interest of supporting a thriving early learning ecosystem requires the state to reestablish a policy of individual exceptions to early enrollment in the public school system. The legislature intends for the reestablished state transition to kindergarten policy to strengthen coordination between early learning and child care programs by directing closer collaboration between the office of the superintendent of public instruction and the department of children, youth, and families. The legislature recognizes that, to prevent disruption of regional child care and early learning systems, the state transition to kindergarten policy must include additional collaboration between operators and proposed operators of the state transition to kindergarten policy and other early learning and child care programs. The legislature intends for the increased agency oversight and modified requirements on operators enrolling children under the state transition to kindergarten policy to minimize adverse impacts on nonpublic school early learning and child care programs.

## Section 2
