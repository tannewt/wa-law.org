## Section 1
1. Subject to the conditions and requirements of this section, the legislative authority of any county may impose an excise tax on the privilege of engaging in business as a utility. The tax is equal to the gross income of the utility derived from providing service to consumers within the county multiplied by the rate imposed by the legislative authority.

2. A county may not impose a rate of tax that exceeds three percent.

3. A utility subject to tax under this section must add the tax to the rates or charges it makes for utility services and separately state the amount of tax on billings.

4. A county may initially impose the tax authorized under this section only on the first day of a calendar quarter and no sooner than 75 days from the date the county adopts the ordinance or resolution imposing the tax.

5. A county may provide exemptions for sales by utilities to business customers, such as manufacturing facilities, aircraft repair facilities, industrial parks, industrial facilities, farm businesses, and computer data centers. A county may not provide a general exemption for sales by utilities to residential customers unless business customers are also exempt.

6. A county must allow a credit against the tax imposed under the authority of this section for the amount of any similar utility tax imposed by a city or town on the same taxable event. The credit required by this subsection may not exceed the amount of tax otherwise due.
