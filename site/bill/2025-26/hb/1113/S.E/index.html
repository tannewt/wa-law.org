<p>This act shall be known and may be cited as the public supporting accountability and fast, effective treatment act, or public SAFE-T act.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In a court of limited jurisdiction, the court may, upon the motion of either party, agree to dismiss a defendant's simple misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor charge pursuant to the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The court may continue a case pursuant to a defendant's agreement to waive speedy trial in anticipation of dismissal following court-ordered conditions for a period of no less than six months, up to a maximum of 12 months, and order the defendant to comply with terms, conditions, or programs that are connected to the underlying charge and reasonably related to supporting the defendant's rehabilitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining which terms, conditions, or programs are appropriate to order, the court shall consider the defendant's specific circumstances affecting the underlying charge, including but not limited to whether the underlying charge is the result of or caused by a behavioral health disorder as defined in RCW 71.05.020, lack of access to stable housing or employment, or a combination of such factors, and whether the defendant has previously been identified as needing competency restoration treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court shall consider ordering the defendant to participate in a recovery navigator program established under RCW 71.24.115, arrest and jail alternative program established under RCW 36.28A.450, law enforcement assisted diversion program established under RCW 71.24.589, Trueblood high utilizer program, or local diversion program, or a combination of such programs, to the extent such programs are available in the jurisdiction and are appropriate for the defendant's specific circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court shall hear from both parties and rule on the motion in open court.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>If the defendant has substantially complied with the imposed terms and conditions, the court shall dismiss the charges pending against the defendant at the end of the continuance period. The court must make written findings that provide an explanation for its decision to grant the dismissal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full restitution must be a required condition for the dismissal of charges. However, a defendant's inability to pay restitution due to indigence may not be grounds for denial of this dismissal following progress towards complying with court-ordered conditions or as a basis for finding that the defendant has failed to substantially comply with the court's conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court shall order the defendant to not commit any new criminal law violations for the entire continuance period as a condition for the dismissal of charges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mandatory conditions described under (b)(ii) and (iii) of this subsection must not be the only conditions ordered by the court.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to dismissing the charges pending against the defendant, the court shall provide an opportunity for victims and survivors of victims to present a statement personally or by representation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it appears to the prosecuting attorney that the defendant is not substantially complying with the terms and conditions, after providing the defendant with written notice of the alleged violations and disclosure of all evidence to be offered against the defendant, the court shall hold a hearing to determine whether the defendant has, by a preponderance of the evidence, willfully failed to substantially comply with the terms and conditions set by the court. At that hearing:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The rules of evidence do not apply, but the defendant must be afforded the due process rights required for the revocation of probation, including the right to confront and cross-examine all witnesses;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The defendant must have the opportunity to be heard in person and to present evidence; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant has failed to comply with the terms and conditions, the court may either continue the hearing to provide additional time for substantial compliance or end the period of continuance pending dismissal and set a new commencement date.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court agrees to dismiss a defendant's simple misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor charge, any written confirmation of completion of an assessment or statement indicating the defendant's enrollment or referral to a specific service or program, or any written updates regarding treatment or services, must be considered a treatment evaluation or compliance form ordered by the court for purposes of Washington state rules of court, General Rule GR 22.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Admissions made by the defendant in the course of receiving treatment or services pursuant to the agreement to dismiss may not be used against the defendant in the prosecution's case-in-chief.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
