<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>In November 1999, various leaders of American Indian nations and the state met at the tribal and state leaders' summit to strengthen the government-to-government relationship and cooperation on issues of mutual concern. As a product of that meeting, the leaders developed the new millennium agreement wherein they made various commitments in the spirit and mutual respect of the 1989 centennial accord, including a commitment to encourage the legislature to establish a structure to address issues of mutual concern to the state and tribes. The purpose of this act is to carry out that commitment by establishing a new legislative office on Indian affairs to provide educational and informational resources to the legislature to further support the vision of the centennial accord to achieve complete institutionalization of the government-to-government relationship.</p>
<p>It is not the legislature's intent to replace the work of the governor's office of Indian affairs, but rather to complement that work by adding a legislative resource for the senate, the house of representatives, and professional legislative staff.</p>
<p>The legislature does not intend this new office to act as a liaison between the legislature and tribal leaders or organizations. However, in recognition of the new millennium agreement's acknowledgment that intertribal organizations and associations serve as an additional vehicle to advance the principles and objectives contained in the centennial accord, it is the legislature's intent that the legislative office on Indian affairs communicate with intertribal organizations for the purpose of being well-informed of developments and issues of mutual concern.</p>
