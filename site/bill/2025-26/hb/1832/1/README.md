# HB 1832 - Improving student performance and success.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1832.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that a significant number of students in Washington are struggling to meet grade-level standards in core academic areas, with 60 percent of students failing to meet grade-level standards in math and 50 percent failing in English language arts. Specifically in reading, 36 percent of third grade students and 40 percent of fourth grade students are below grade level. On national assessments, 72 percent of Washington eighth graders are not proficient in math. This persistent underperformance poses a critical challenge to the academic success and future opportunities of Washington's students.

2. The legislature further finds that literacy is the foundation upon which all other academic success is built. Learning to read and write is a core element of the state's statutory program of basic education, and these foundational skills are necessary for success in all other subjects. By around the fourth grade, students must transition from "learning to read" to "reading to learn," where they rely on reading skills to access information in subjects like science and social studies. If students do not achieve strong literacy skills by this critical stage, their ability to succeed in these subjects and beyond will be severely compromised.

3. Given these alarming statistics and the importance of early literacy and mathematics skills, the legislature intends to take comprehensive and evidence-based actions to improve student outcomes. The legislature intends to provide additional funding for school districts to target support for students who are not meeting grade-level standards in math and English language arts. The legislature also intends to provide bonuses to educators whose efforts directly lead to improved student performance on assessments, incentivizing excellence in teaching.

4. In an effort to improve early literacy, and set high expectations, the legislature intends to require all students to enter the fourth grade equipped with the reading skills needed to continue their learning. The legislature plans to provide multiple pathways for students to demonstrate proficiency in order to enter fourth grade and intends to allow for good cause exemptions for specific students. However, the legislature believes students must not move to the fourth grade prematurely. This is a critical juncture in a student's education with far-reaching effects on the student's future. Washington public schools have the potential to significantly improve both academic performance and students' lives, similar to states like Mississippi, which, despite having one of the highest populations of low-income students, has achieved remarkable success in reading outcomes.

5. In order to aid schools in meeting this challenge, the legislature intends to provide for the hiring of reading coaches in elementary schools, ensuring students receive expert guidance in building essential literacy skills. Additionally, by the 2027-28 school year, the legislature intends to require public schools to implement a structured literacy program that aligns with the science of reading, an approach that research shows has an effectiveness rate of at least 95 percent. This program incorporates the five pillars of reading: Phonology and phonemic awareness; orthographic knowledge or phonics; reading and writing fluency; vocabulary or oral language knowledge and proficiency; and semantics or comprehension of written language. The legislature intends for these programs to be evidence-based, systemic, sequential, and cumulative, ensuring high quality, explicit, and rigorous instruction that meets the diverse needs of all students. To that end, the legislature also intends to provide further resources for teachers to support students with dyslexia.

6. To improve the quality of reading instruction, the legislature also intends to prohibit ineffective methods that encourage students to guess words. The legislature intends to require the office of the superintendent of public instruction to monitor school district literacy programs to ensure compliance with these new requirements, facilitating continuous improvement across schools.

7. Furthermore, the legislature intends to update teacher endorsement standards for reading and literacy. Teacher preparation programs will be required to include these updated standards. To support teachers in the field, the office of the superintendent of public instruction will regularly update training programs and offer refresher courses focused on evidence-based professional development. This training is intended to address the science of reading and the implementation of effective literacy instruction for students in kindergarten through grade four.

8. Finally, the legislature intends to call for a review of the state's mathematics standards, including a comparison to Singapore math, to assess whether updating the state's standards could improve outcomes for Washington students in this critical subject area.

9. Through these actions, the legislature seeks to ensure that every student in Washington has the foundational skills in literacy and mathematics needed to succeed academically and beyond. These measures align with the state's commitment to providing high quality basic education, addressing the urgent need for intervention and improvement in reading, writing, and mathematics.

## Section 2
1. Beginning September 1, 2025, according to the schedule established under RCW 28A.510.250, in addition to the amounts provided in RCW 28A.150.260(10), the superintendent of public instruction must allocate up to $250 per eligible student to each school district, increased for inflation from the 2025-26 school year, to establish supplemental supports for students who are not meeting academic standards. The allocation must be calculated as follows:
