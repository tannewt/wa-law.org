The statute of limitations on actions not subject to RCW 4.16.160 that are brought under this chapter by the director is five years.

However, the director may reinstate suspended licenses or issue new licenses to a licensee whose license or licenses have been revoked if the director finds that the licensee meets all the requirements of this chapter.
