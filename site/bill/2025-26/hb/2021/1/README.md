# HB 2021 - Public works board bonds

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2021.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that there exists in the state of Washington over four billion dollars worth of critical projects for the planning, acquisition, construction, repair, replacement, rehabilitation, or improvement of streets and roads, bridges, water systems, and storm and sanitary sewage systems. The December, 1983 Washington state public works report prepared by the planning and community affairs agency documented that local governments expect to be capable of financing over two billion dollars worth of the costs of those critical projects but will not be able to fund nearly half of the documented needs.

The legislature further finds that Washington's local governments have unmet financial needs for solid waste disposal, including recycling, and encourages the board to make an equitable geographic distribution of the funds.

It is the policy of the state of Washington to encourage self-reliance by local governments in meeting their public works needs and to assist in the financing of critical public works projects by authorizing the public works board, without using public funds or lending the credit of the state or local government, to issue nonrecourse revenue bonds and to participate in federal, state, and local public works infrastructure programs and thereby make additional funds available at affordable rates to help provide public works infrastructure improvements throughout the state.

## Section 9
1. The board shall adopt written policies to provide for the selection of bond counsel. The policies shall provide for the creation and maintenance of a roster of attorneys whom the board believes possess the requisite special expertise and professional standing to provide bond counsel opinions which would be accepted by the underwriters, bondholders, and other members of the financial community, and which would be in furtherance of the public interest in obtaining the lowest possible interest rates on the bonds issued by the board. Any attorney may apply to have the attorney's name placed on the roster, but may not be placed on the roster unless the attorney demonstrates to the board's satisfaction that the attorney would issue the kind of opinions required by this section.

2. Prior to selecting an attorney or attorneys to provide bond counsel services, the board shall provide all attorneys on the roster with a notice of its intentions to select bond counsel and shall invite each of them to submit to the board the attorney's schedule for providing bond counsel services. The board shall have wide discretion in selecting the attorney or attorneys it considers to be most appropriate to provide the services, but in the exercise of this discretion the board shall consider all submitted fee schedules and the public interest in achieving both savings in bond counsel fees and issuance of bonds on terms most favorable to the board. At least once every two calendar years, the board shall select anew an attorney or attorneys to serve as bond counsel. However, the board may retain an attorney for longer than two years when necessary to complete work on a particular bond issue.

Any underwriter may apply to have its name placed on the roster, but may not be placed on the roster unless it demonstrates to the board's satisfaction that it meets the requirements of this section.

2. Whenever the board decides that it needs the services of an underwriter, it shall provide all underwriters on the roster with a notice of its intentions and shall invite each of them to submit to the board an itemization of its fees and other charges for providing underwriting services on the issue. The itemization shall be by categories designed by the board. The board shall have wide discretion in selecting the underwriter it considers to be most appropriate to provide the services, but in the exercise of this discretion the board shall consider the underwriter's fees and other charges and the public interest in achieving both savings in the total costs of underwriting services and issuance of bonds on terms most favorable to the board.

## Section 11
The board shall submit the initial policies adopted under sections 9 and 10 of this act to the chief clerk of the house of representatives and the secretary of the senate for transmittal to and review by the appropriate standing committees and the joint administrative rules review committee.

Execution of the bonds may be by manual or facsimile signature.

2. The bonds of the board shall be subject to such terms, conditions, covenants, and protective provisions as are found necessary or desirable by the board including, but not limited to, pledges of the board's assets, setting aside of reserves, limitations on additional forms of indebtedness, and the mortgaging of all or any part of the board's real or personal property, then owned or thereafter acquired, and other provisions the board finds are necessary or desirable for the security of bondholders.

3. Any security interest created in the unexpended bond proceeds and in the special funds created by the board shall be immediately valid and binding against such moneys and any securities in which such moneys may be invested without board or trustee possession thereof, and the security interest shall be prior to any party having any competing claim in such moneys or securities, without filing or recording pursuant to chapter 62A.9A RCW and regardless of whether the party has notice of the security interest.

4. When issuing bonds, the board may provide for the future issuance of additional bonds or parity debt on a parity with outstanding bonds, and the terms and conditions of their issuance.

2. Bonds issued under this chapter shall contain a recital on their face to the effect that payment of the principal of, interest on, and prepayment premium, if any, on the bonds, shall be a valid claim only as against the special fund or funds relating thereto, that neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the state or any municipal corporation, subdivision, or agency of the state, other than the board as set forth in this chapter, is pledged to the payment of the principal of, interest on, and prepayment premium, if any, on the bonds.

3. Contracts entered into by the board shall be entered into in the name of the board and not in the name of the state of Washington. The obligations of the board under the contracts shall be obligations only of the board and are not in any way obligations of the state of Washington.

Such fund or funds shall at all times be segregated and set apart from all other funds and held in trust for the purposes for which such bonds were issued as determined by the board. Money other than bond sale proceeds received by the board for these same purposes, such as private contributions or grants from the federal government, may be deposited in such fund or funds. Proceeds received from the sale of the bonds may also be used to defray the expenses of the board in connection with and incidental to the issuance and sale of bonds, as well as expenses for studies, surveys, estimates, plans, inspections, and examinations of or incidental to the purposes for which the bonds were issued, and other costs advanced therefor by third parties or by the board. In lieu of the board receiving and handling these moneys in the manner outlined in this section, the board may appoint trustees, depositaries, paying agents, and other financial institutions within or without the state to perform the functions outlined and to receive, hold, disburse, invest, and reinvest such funds on its behalf and for the protection of the bondholders.

## Section 17
Any owner of bonds of the board issued under this chapter, and the trustee under any trust agreement or indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceeding, protect and enforce any of their respective rights, and may become the purchaser at any foreclosure sale if the person is the highest bidder, except to the extent the rights given are restricted by the board in any bond resolution or trust agreement or indenture authorizing the issuance of the bonds.

Rules adopted under this act must meet federal requirements that are a necessary condition to the receipt of federal funds by the state.
