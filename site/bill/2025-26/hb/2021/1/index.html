<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that there exists in the state of Washington over four billion dollars worth of critical projects for the planning, acquisition, construction, repair, replacement, rehabilitation, or improvement of streets and roads, bridges, water systems, and storm and sanitary sewage systems. The December, 1983 Washington state public works report prepared by the planning and community affairs agency documented that local governments expect to be capable of financing over two billion dollars worth of the costs of those critical projects but will not be able to fund nearly half of the documented needs.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that Washington's local governments have unmet financial needs for solid waste disposal, including recycling, and encourages the board to make an equitable geographic distribution of the funds.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the state of Washington to encourage self-reliance by local governments in meeting their public works needs and to assist in the financing of critical public works projects by authorizing the public works board, without using public funds or lending the credit of the state or local government, to issue nonrecourse revenue bonds and to participate in federal, state, and local public works infrastructure programs and thereby make additional funds available at affordable rates to help provide public works infrastructure improvements throughout the state.</p>

<ol type="a">

<p>Make loans or grants to local governments from the public works assistance account or other funds and accounts for the purpose of assisting local governments in financing public works projects. Money received from local governments in repayment of loans made under this section from the public works assistance account shall be paid into the public works assistance account for uses consistent with this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pledge money in the public works assistance account, or money to be received by the public works assistance account, to the repayment of all or a portion of the principal of or interest on obligations issued by local governments to finance public works projects. The board shall not pledge any amount greater than the sum of money in the public works assistance account plus money to be received from the payment of the debt service on loans made from that account, nor shall the board pledge the faith and credit or the taxing power of the state or any agency or subdivision thereof to the repayment of obligations issued by any local government.</p>

<li>
<p>Provide a method for the allocation of loans, grants, and financing guarantees and the provision of technical assistance under this chapter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>When establishing interest rates for loan programs authorized in this chapter for projects which are supported by a rate base of at least 50,000 equivalent residential units, the board must base interest rates on the average daily market interest rate for tax-exempt municipal bonds as published in the bond buyer's index for the period from 60 to 30 days before the start of the application cycle.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>For projects with a repayment period between five and 20 years, the rate must be 50 percent of the market rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For projects with a repayment period under five years, the rate must be 25 percent of the market rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For any year in which the average daily market interest rate for tax-exempt municipal bonds for the period from 60 to 30 days before the start of an application cycle is nine percent or greater, the board may cap interest rates at four percent for projects with a repayment period between five and 20 years and at two percent for projects with a repayment period under five years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board may also provide reduced interest rates, extended repayment periods, or grants for projects that meet financial hardship criteria as measured by the affordability index or similar standard measure of financial hardship. The board may provide reduced interest rates, extended repayment periods, or grants for projects that are supported by a rate base of less than 50,000 equivalent residential units.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>All local public works projects aided in whole or in part under the provisions of this chapter shall be put out for competitive bids, except for emergency public works under RCW 43.155.065 for which the recipient jurisdiction shall comply with this requirement to the extent feasible and practicable.

<li>
<p>Prior to selecting an attorney or attorneys to provide bond counsel services, the board shall provide all attorneys on the roster with a notice of its intentions to select bond counsel and shall invite each of them to submit to the board the attorney's schedule for providing bond counsel services.
