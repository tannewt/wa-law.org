# HB 1445 - Washington health trust

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1445.pdf)

## Section 101
Based on input from the department of health and the universal health care commission, the legislature finds that healthy Washingtonians contribute to the economic well-being of their families but suffer from the greatest economic crisis since the great depression made worse by a public health crisis. Skyrocketing unemployment rates have exposed the inequalities of the current private employer-based health care system while causing unsustainable strain to the state's medicaid system. These disparities disproportionately affect already marginalized communities. With the intent to provide stable coverage from time of birth and maintained as a legal guarantee to all residents, the Washington legislature shall create a single unified nonprofit financing entity called the Washington health trust to provide reimbursements for all medical expenditures covered under the program. Multiple economic analyses find that removing means testing in favor of universal eligibility under a single comprehensive coverage package and standardizing reimbursement rates will simplify health financing, eliminate administrative waste, create more equitable outcomes across the state, and guarantee all residents coverage across a comprehensive set of essential health benefits without the burden of premiums, deductibles, copayments, or medical bills regardless of skin color, cultural identity, level of income, or other socioeconomic status.

1. All residents of the state of Washington are eligible for coverage through this chapter.

2. Individuals enrolled for essential health benefits under this chapter may obtain health services from any participating institution, agency, or individual qualified to provide the service including participating providers outside the state.

3. Residents may obtain coverage for health care benefits in excess of those available under the trust, including additional benefits that an employer may provide to employees and their dependents and spouses or to former employees and their dependents and spouses.

4. No person shall, on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, disability, immigration status, or sex, including sex stereotyping, gender identity, sexual orientation, body size, and pregnancy and related medical or preexisting conditions, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination by any participating provider or any entity conducting, administering, or funding a health program or activity, including contracts of insurance, under this chapter.

5. Participating providers may not be denied reimbursement by the Washington health trust for any essential health benefit that is within the scope of their practice, consistent with the accepted standard of care as described in RCW 7.70.040.

6. A participating health care provider is not required to furnish any health care service that is outside the scope of their practice or, in the health care provider's reasonable clinical judgment, not consistent with the accepted standard of care as described in RCW 7.70.040.

7. Participating providers may receive payments from sources other than the trust. However, any provider who does accept payment from the trust for a service must accept that payment, along with applicable copayments, as payment in full.

8. Any provider, institution, agency, or individual that is qualified to provide a health care service covered under this chapter is entitled to participate and receive reimbursement as described in section 109 of this act.

9. Nothing in this chapter is intended to interfere with tribal sovereignty over any federal or state funding set aside for tribal health or Indian health services, including those provided by chapter 43.71B RCW.

2. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter or RCW 82.32.080, taxpayers owing tax under this chapter must file, on forms prescribed by the department, a return with the department on or before the date the taxpayer's federal income tax return for the taxable year is required to be filed along with all schedules and supporting documentation.

The taxpayer must pay any additional tax due resulting from the finally determined internal revenue service adjustment or a taxpayer adjustment without notice and assessment. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter or any other title to the contrary, the period of limitation for the collection of the additional tax, interest, and penalty due as a result of such an adjustment by the taxpayer or a finally determined internal revenue service adjustment must begin at the later of 30 days following the final determination of the adjustment or the date of the filing of the corrected return.

4. If a taxpayer required to file a return under this section has obtained an extension of time for filing the federal tax return for the taxable year, the taxpayer is entitled to the same extension of time for filing the return required under this section if the taxpayer provides the department, before the due date provided in subsection (1) of this section, the extension confirmation number or other evidence satisfactory to the department confirming the federal extension. An extension under this subsection for the filing of a return under this chapter is not an extension of time to pay the tax due under this chapter.

5. If any return due on long-term capital gains under subsection (1) of this section, along with a copy of the federal tax return, is not filed with the department by the due date or any extension granted by the department, the department must assess a penalty in the amount of five percent of the tax due for the taxable year covered by the return for each month or portion of a month that the return remains unfiled. The total penalty assessed under this subsection may not exceed 25 percent of the tax due for the taxable year covered by the delinquent return.

    a. The penalty under this subsection is in addition to any penalties assessed for the late payment of any tax due on the return.

    b. The department must waive or cancel the penalty imposed under this subsection if:

        i. The department is persuaded that the taxpayer's failure to file the return by the due date was due to circumstances beyond the taxpayer's control; or

        ii. The taxpayer has not been delinquent in filing any return due under this section during the preceding five calendar years.

## Section 311
1. If the federal income tax liabilities of both spouses are determined on a joint federal return for the taxable year, they must file a joint return under this chapter.

2. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if the federal income tax liability of either spouse is determined on a separate federal return for the taxable year, they must file separate returns under this chapter. State registered domestic partners may file a joint return under this chapter even if they filed separate federal returns for the taxable year.

3. In any case in which a joint return is filed under this section, the liability of each spouse or state registered domestic partner is joint and several, unless:

    a. The spouse is relieved of liability for federal tax purposes as provided under Title 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6015 of the internal revenue code; or

    b. The department determines that the domestic partner qualifies for relief as provided by rule of the department. Such rule, to the extent possible without being inconsistent with this chapter, must follow Title 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6015.
