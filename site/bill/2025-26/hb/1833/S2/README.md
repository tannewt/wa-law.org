## Section 1
The legislature recognizes that fostering technological innovation is essential for Washington state's economic growth and long-term competitiveness. By investing in emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, the state can access new sources of revenue, create high paying jobs, and position itself as a national leader in cutting-edge industries. Artificial intelligence-driven solutions have the potential to address critical statewide challenges, such as predicting and managing wildfires, improving the effectiveness of cybersecurity, and improving public health responses. Supporting the development of these technologies will not only strengthen Washington's economy, but also enhance public safety and government efficiency.

Therefore, the legislature intends to authorize the establishment of an innovation grant program to support organizations that create transformative new technologies. These grants will provide critical funding to startups, research institutions, and companies working on advancements with broad public benefits, ensuring that Washington remains at the forefront of technological progress. By encouraging innovation, this act will drive economic expansion, attract private investment, and equip the state with cutting-edge tools to address its most pressing challenges.

## Section 2
1. The department is authorized to establish the spark act grant program to promote the economic development of innovative uses of artificial intelligence.

2. The department may solicit input from the artificial intelligence task force, created in chapter 163, Laws of 2024, no less than once per year through 2027, to identify state priorities to form the basis of the grants. When the department evaluates applications, it shall prioritize:

    a. An applicant that has committed to ethical uses of artificial intelligence;

    b. An applicant that has analyzed the risks associated with its product;

3. The department may award grants on an annual basis or more frequently.

4. The department may take all appropriate steps to seek and apply for federal funds, and other grants, and accept donations, and must deposit these funds in the spark act grant program account created in section 3 of this act.

5. Eligible applicants shall apply for the grant program in a manner to be determined by the department. To be eligible, an applicant's proposal must include technology that will be shared with the state and provide a state benefit, such as wildfire tracking, cybersecurity, or health care advancements.

7. For the purposes of this section, "artificial intelligence" means the use of machine learning and related technologies that use data to train statistical models for the purpose of enabling computer systems to perform tasks normally associated with human intelligence or perception, such as computer vision, speech or natural language processing, and content generation.

8. The department may adopt rules to implement this section.

## Section 3
The spark act grant program account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. All receipts from federal funds and gifts, grants, and donations must be deposited into the account.

Only the director of the department or the director's designee may authorize expenditures from the account. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures.
