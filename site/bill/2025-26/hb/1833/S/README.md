## Section 1
The legislature recognizes that fostering technological innovation is essential for Washington state's economic growth and long-term competitiveness. By investing in emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, the state can access new sources of revenue, create high paying jobs, and position itself as a national leader in cutting-edge industries. Artificial intelligence-driven solutions have the potential to address critical statewide challenges, such as predicting and managing wildfires, improving the effectiveness of cybersecurity, and improving public health responses. Supporting the development of these technologies will not only strengthen Washington's economy, but also enhance public safety and government efficiency.

Therefore, the legislature intends to establish an innovation grant program to support organizations that create transformative new technologies. These grants will provide critical funding to startups, research institutions, and companies working on advancements with broad public benefits, ensuring that Washington remains at the forefront of technological progress. By encouraging innovation, this act will drive economic expansion, attract private investment, and equip the state with cutting-edge tools to address its most pressing challenges.
