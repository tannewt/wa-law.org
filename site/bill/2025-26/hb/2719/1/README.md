# HB 2719 - Foster care/scholarships

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2719.pdf)

## Section 1
1. Article IX, section 1 of the state Constitution makes clear that it is the paramount duty of the state to make ample provision for the education of all children residing within its borders, without distinction or preference on account of race, color, caste, or sex. The legislature finds that among the most vulnerable populations in our state are children in the foster care system. Students who are the subject of a dependency proceeding face unique educational challenges and barriers that require specialized support and flexibility. Research consistently shows that students in foster care experience higher rates of school mobility, disrupted educational services, lower academic achievement, and reduced graduation rates compared to their peers.

2. The legislature recognizes that foster care students often face circumstances that make traditional public school settings challenging, including frequent placement changes, trauma, special education needs, and the need for therapeutic services. While the public school system strives to meet these needs, not every foster care student thrives in a traditional public school environment. Parents, foster parents, and caregivers should have access to educational options that best meet the unique needs of the foster care students in their care.

3. Students in foster care are among the most disadvantaged students in Washington's education system. According to the office of the superintendent of public instruction, foster care students consistently perform below state averages on standardized assessments and have significantly lower graduation rates. These students deserve every opportunity and resource to succeed academically and reach their full potential. Providing educational choice through education savings accounts specifically targeted to foster care students offers a pathway to individualized education that can address their unique circumstances and trauma-informed needs.

4. The legislature acknowledges that the circumstances of foster care students are particularly unstable and challenging. Students may be removed from their homes with little notice, placed in multiple foster homes during their time in care, and face uncertainty about their future. This instability profoundly impacts their education. Allowing funding to follow foster care students ensures continuity of educational services regardless of placement changes and gives foster parents and caregivers the tools they need to provide stability in at least one aspect of these students' lives.

5. The legislature understands that some families may choose religious private schools for foster care students. However, the United States supreme court has made it clear through two recent cases, Carson v. Makin, 596 U.S. 767 (2022) and Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, 591 U.S. 464 (2020), that if the government creates a program, it cannot then discriminate against religious institutions' participation. This is not a new concept for Washington state. This state has a history of providing education funding support in private religious institutions, specifically for postsecondary education programs.

6. The legislature finds that focusing educational choice programs on the most vulnerable students, such as those in foster care, represents sound public policy. These students have already experienced trauma and instability in their lives, and the state has a particular responsibility as parens patriae to ensure they receive educational opportunities suited to their unique needs. This targeted approach ensures limited resources are directed to students with the greatest need while allowing the system to assess outcomes before considering broader expansion.

7. Therefore, the legislature intends to allow the money invested in foster care students to follow the student by establishing the empowerED scholarship program for foster care students. The program will fund education savings accounts for students who are in foster care or who have aged out of foster care. Parents, foster parents, and caregivers who apply for the scholarship on behalf of eligible students are legally required to only use the funds for education-related expenses. The legislature intends to make the funds accessible with the use of a debit card managed by the state with oversight capability so that the system can be audited. The fund is intended to receive revenue from the legislature, as well as a business and occupation tax credit, so businesses can provide direct support to students. This measure will empower those caring for foster care students to do what is best for these vulnerable children while also meeting the state's moral and constitutional obligation to put our most vulnerable students first.

    q. What school does the student's sibling attend?

    s. Would the availability of the empowerED scholarship program established in section 4 of this act make private school or another alternative to traditional public school the best option for the student?

5. The student must remain in the student's school of origin while a best interest determination is made and while disputes are resolved in order to minimize disruption and reduce the number of school transfers.

6. School districts are encouraged to use any:

    a. Best interest determination guide developed by the office of the superintendent of public instruction during the discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of keeping the student in the school of origin or transferring the student to a new school; and
