<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the combustion of liquid fuels used by vessels transiting waters near Washington releases particulate matter that is harmful to human health on ship and on shore, and to the environment. Some technologies designed to reduce air pollution generated by vessel fuel combustion produce different harms to the environment. The legislature further finds that lower-sulfur fuels have fewer harmful emissions associated with their combustion, and do not require the use of onboard technologies that have harmful environmental impacts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to protect the public health and environment of Washington residents by requiring ocean-going vessels to use low-sulfur fuels when approaching Washington shores.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, noncompliance fees paid by a person under this section must be paid to the port or ports at which the vessel is conducting a port visit. Funds received by ports under this section may only be used for port electrification or other criteria pollutant emission reduction activities associated with port operations, under an enforceable agreement between the port and the department. A port may not use fees received under this section to fund projects on vessels from which noncompliance fees were paid.</p>

<p>A person violating a requirement of this chapter, a rule adopted under this chapter, or an order issued under this chapter, is subject to a civil penalty in an amount of $10,000 per day for each violation. Each violation is a separate and distinct offense. The penalty amount must be set in consideration of the previous history of the violator and the severity of the violation's impact on public health, the environment, or both, in addition to other factors deemed relevant by the department. Penalties are appealable to the pollution control hearings board, and collected penalties must be deposited in the natural climate solutions account created in RCW 70A.65.270.</p>
</li>
