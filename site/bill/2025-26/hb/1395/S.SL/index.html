<li>
<p>Where the department is required to screen a long-term care worker, contracted provider, or licensee through a background check to determine whether the person has a history that would disqualify the person from having unsupervised access to, working with, or providing supervision, care, or treatment to vulnerable adults or children, the department may not automatically disqualify a person on the basis of a criminal record that includes a conviction of any of the following crimes once the specified amount of time has passed for the particular crime:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Selling cannabis to a person under RCW 69.50.401 after three years or more have passed between the most recent conviction and the date the background check is processed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Theft in the first degree under RCW 9A.56.030 after 10 years or more have passed between the most recent conviction and the date the background check is processed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Robbery in the second degree under RCW 9A.56.210 after five years or more have passed between the most recent conviction and the date the background check is processed;</p>
</li>

<p>Extortion in the second degree under RCW 9A.56.130 after five years or more have passed between the most recent conviction and the date the background check is processed;</p>
</li>
