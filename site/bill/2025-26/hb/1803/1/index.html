</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Family assessment&quot; means a comprehensive assessment of child safety, risk of subsequent child abuse or neglect, and family strengths and needs that is applied to a child abuse or neglect report. Family assessment does not include a determination as to whether child abuse or neglect occurred, but does determine the need for services to address the safety of the child and the risk of subsequent maltreatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Family assessment response&quot; means a way of responding to certain reports of child abuse or neglect made under this chapter using a differential response approach to child protective services.

</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Negligent treatment or maltreatment&quot; means an act or a failure to act, or the cumulative effects of a pattern of conduct, behavior, or inaction, that evidences a serious disregard of consequences of such magnitude as to constitute a clear and present danger to a child's health, welfare, or safety, including but not limited to conduct prohibited under RCW 9A.42.100. When considering whether a clear and present danger exists, evidence of a parent's substance abuse as a contributing factor to negligent treatment or maltreatment shall be given great weight. The fact that siblings share a bedroom is not, in and of itself, negligent treatment or maltreatment. Poverty, experiencing homelessness, or exposure to domestic violence as defined in RCW 7.105.010 that is perpetrated against someone other than the child does not constitute negligent treatment or maltreatment in and of itself.</p>

If the parents fail to designate a second physician, the department may make the selection. If a physician finds that a child has suffered abuse or neglect but that such abuse or neglect does not constitute imminent danger to the child's health or safety, and the department agrees with the physician's assessment, the child may be left in the parents' home while the department proceeds with reasonable efforts to remedy parenting deficiencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persons or agencies exchanging information under subsection (7) of this section shall not further disseminate or release the information except as authorized by state or federal statute. Violation of this subsection is a misdemeanor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon receiving a report that a child is a candidate for foster care as defined in RCW 26.44.020, the department may provide prevention and family services and programs to the child's parents, guardian, or caregiver.

<p>The report indicates conduct involving a criminal offense that has, or is about to occur, in which the child is the victim; or</p>

<li>
<p>Use a method by which to assign cases to investigation or family assessment which are based on an array of factors that may include the presence of: Imminent danger, level of risk, number of previous child abuse or neglect reports, or other presenting case characteristics, such as the type of alleged maltreatment and the age of the alleged victim. Age of the alleged victim shall not be used as the sole criterion for determining case assignment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow for a change in response assignment based on new information that alters risk or safety level;</p>

<li>
<p>Allow families assigned to family assessment to choose to receive an investigation rather than a family assessment;</p>

<li>
<p>Provide a full investigation if a family refuses the initial family assessment;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide voluntary services to families based on the results of the initial family assessment. If a family refuses voluntary services, and the department cannot identify specific facts related to risk or safety that warrant assignment to investigation under this chapter, and there is not a history of reports of child abuse or neglect related to the family, then the department must close the family assessment response case. However, if at any time the department identifies risk or safety factors that warrant an investigation under this chapter, then the family assessment response case must be reassigned to investigation;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="i" start="6">
<li>Conduct an investigation, and not a family assessment, in response to an allegation that, the department determines based on the intake assessment:</li>

    i. A child who is a candidate for foster care, as defined in RCW 26.44.020; and

    ii. A child who is in foster care and who is pregnant, parenting, or both.

d. The department may not be held civilly liable for the decision to respond to an allegation of child abuse or neglect by using the family assessment response under this section unless the state or its officers, agents, or employees acted with reckless disregard.

<p>In conducting an investigation or family assessment of alleged abuse or neglect, the department or law enforcement agency:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>May interview children. If the department determines that the response to the allegation will be family assessment response, the preferred practice is to request a parent's, guardian's, or custodian's permission to interview the child before conducting the child interview unless doing so would compromise the safety of the child or the integrity of the assessment. The interviews may be conducted on school premises, at day-care facilities, at the child's home, or at other suitable locations outside of the presence of parents. If the allegation is investigated, parental notification of the interview must occur at the earliest possible point in the investigation that will not jeopardize the safety or protection of the child or the course of the investigation. Prior to commencing the interview the department or law enforcement agency shall determine whether the child wishes a third party to be present for the interview and, if so, shall make reasonable efforts to accommodate the child's wishes. Unless the child objects, the department or law enforcement agency shall make reasonable efforts to include a third party in any interview so long as the presence of the third party will not jeopardize the course of the investigation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shall have access to all relevant records of the child in the possession of mandated reporters and their employees.</p>

<p>The department shall make available on its public website a downloadable and printable poster that includes the reporting requirements included in this section.
