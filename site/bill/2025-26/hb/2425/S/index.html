<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A registered nurse under his or her license may perform for compensation nursing care, as that term is usually understood, to individuals with illnesses, injuries, or disabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A registered nurse may, at or under the general direction of a licensed physician and surgeon, dentist, osteopathic physician and surgeon, naturopathic physician, optometrist, podiatric physician and surgeon, physician assistant, advanced practice registered nurse, or midwife acting within the scope of his or her license, administer medications, treatments, tests, and inoculations, whether or not the severing or penetrating of tissues is involved and whether or not a degree of independent judgment and skill is required. Such direction must be for acts which are within the scope of registered nursing practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A registered nurse may delegate tasks  to other individuals in any setting where the registered nurse determines that it is in the best interest of the patient and within the nurse's scope of practice.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The delegating nurse shall:</p>
<pre><code>a. Determine the competency of the individual to perform the tasks, including verifying certification or documentation where required by rule or law;

b. Evaluate the stability of the patient and the appropriateness of the delegation; and

c. Supervise the actions of the person performing the delegated task
</code></pre>
<p>.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>Except as authorized in subsections (7) and (8) of this section, a registered nurse may not delegate the administration of medications, tasks involving piercing or severing of tissues, or acts that require substantial skill. Acts that require nursing judgment may not be delegated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No person may coerce a nurse into compromising patient safety by requiring the nurse to delegate if the nurse determines that it is inappropriate to do so. Nurses shall not be subject to any employer reprisal or disciplinary action by the board for refusing to delegate tasks or refusing to provide the required training for delegation if the nurse determines delegation may compromise patient safety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nurse is accountable for his or her own individual actions in the delegation process. Nurses acting within  their delegation authority are immune from liability for any action performed in the course of their delegation duties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If trained and delegated the task by a nurse, a nursing assistant or home care aide, credentialed under chapter 18.88A or 18.88B RCW, respectively, may administer medications, including those that pierce the skin through subcutaneous injections, and may perform capillary blood sticks. These tasks may never include administration of medication intramuscularly or intravenously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A nurse may delegate tasks to a medical assistant credentialed under chapter 18.360 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nursing task delegation protocols are not intended to regulate the settings in which delegation may occur, but are intended to ensure that nursing care services have a consistent standard of practice upon which the public and the profession may rely, and to safeguard the authority of the nurse to make independent professional decisions regarding the delegation of a task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Education and training provided by a registered nurse to a caregiver who is a parent, guardian, or family member who is designated to provide care for a patient is not considered delegation of nursing care tasks, regardless of whether the caregiver is paid to complete the task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The board may adopt rules to implement this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By January 1, 2028, the board shall adopt rules to address appropriate delegation parameters.</p>
</li>

<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that nurses have been successfully delegating nursing care tasks to family members and others for many years. The opportunity for a nurse to delegate nursing care tasks to home care aides certified under this chapter may enhance the viability and quality of health care services in community-based care settings and in-home care settings to allow individuals to live as independently as possible with maximum safeguards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A certified home care aide who wishes to perform a nurse delegated task pursuant to RCW 18.79.260 must complete nurse delegation core training under chapter 18.88A RCW before the home care aide may be delegated a nursing care task by a registered nurse delegator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Home care aides are accountable for their own individual actions in the delegation process. Home care aides accurately following  delegation instructions from a  nurse are immune from liability regarding the performance of the delegated duties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Home care aides are not subject to :</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Any employer reprisal or disciplinary action by the secretary for refusing to accept delegation of a nursing care task based on his or her concerns about patient safety issues. No facility or employer may discriminate or retaliate in any manner against a person because the person made a complaint about the nurse delegation process or cooperated in the investigation of the complaint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liability, reprisal, or disciplinary action when administering medications in an emergency response situation if the patient has a prescribed and available medication for that specific type of emergency event.</p>
