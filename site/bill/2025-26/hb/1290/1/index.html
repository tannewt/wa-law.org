<li>
<p>The department of ecology is hereby designated as the state water pollution control agency for all purposes of the federal clean water act as it exists on February 4, 1987, and is hereby authorized to participate fully in the programs of the act as well as to take all action necessary to secure to the state the benefits and to meet the requirements of that act. With regard to the national estuary program established by section 320 of that act, the department shall exercise its responsibility jointly with the Puget Sound partnership, created in RCW 90.71.210. The department of ecology may delegate its authority under this chapter, including its national pollutant discharge elimination permit system authority and duties regarding animal feeding operations and concentrated animal feeding operations, to the department of agriculture through a memorandum of understanding. Until any such delegation receives federal approval, the department of agriculture's adoption or issuance of animal feeding operation and concentrated animal feeding operation rules, permits, programs, and directives pertaining to water quality shall be accomplished after reaching agreement with the director of the department of ecology. Adoption or issuance and implementation shall be accomplished so that compliance with such animal feeding operation and concentrated animal feeding operation rules, permits, programs, and directives will achieve compliance with all federal and state water pollution control laws. The powers granted herein include, among others, and notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter or otherwise, the following:</p>
<ol type="a">

</li>
<li>
<p>If a national pollutant discharge elimination system general permittee discharges to a waterbody for which a total maximum daily load for temperature has been issued and the permittee is not in compliance with the terms of the permittee's permit, the department must offer the permittee a watershed-based water quality trading program to assist the permittee to come into compliance with the terms of the permit through a community-based or market-based water quality trading program. In any such water quality trading program, the department must offer incentives whenever feasible to do so for any improvements made by or on behalf of the permittee that take place in the built environment or that otherwise address the urban heat island effect on waters of the state.</p>
