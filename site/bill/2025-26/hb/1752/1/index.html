<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that a quick response to alleged juvenile offenses may prevent further juvenile offenses and better serve the community. Given the large volume of cases heard in juvenile court, the legislature intends to provide greater flexibility in allowing courts of limited jurisdiction to have concurrent jurisdiction over less serious juvenile offenses. When courts of limited jurisdiction are capable of hearing these cases and respond more quickly, it will better serve the community to have this option.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>(1) Except as provided in this section, the juvenile courts in this state shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over all proceedings:</p>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Any county may authorize courts of limited jurisdiction within the county to exercise concurrent jurisdiction with the juvenile court according to the requirements of this section. Courts of limited jurisdiction may exercise concurrent jurisdiction with the juvenile court over misdemeanor offenses when:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Those offenses are allegedly committed by a juvenile;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The alleged juvenile offender's standard range disposition does not include a term of confinement as defined in RCW 13.40.020;</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>The court of limited jurisdiction has an agreement with the county juvenile detention facility that allows the court of limited jurisdiction to order juveniles into the detention facility; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court of limited jurisdiction has an agreement with the county juvenile court to access the same community supervision and restorative justice programming as juveniles who are adjudicated in juvenile court.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The juvenile court retains jurisdiction over an offense that meets the description under subsection (1) of this section if the juvenile is charged with another offense arising out of the same incident and the juvenile court would otherwise have jurisdiction over that subsequent offense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jurisdiction under this section does not constitute a decline or transfer of juvenile court jurisdiction under RCW 13.40.110.</p>

<li>
<p>The procedural and dispositional standards of chapter 13.40 RCW apply to juvenile offenses described under this section.</p>
