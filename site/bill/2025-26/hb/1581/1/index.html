<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the state has made significant progress in establishing and implementing the 988 suicide and crisis lifeline, creating greater access to crisis services for individuals and their families in need. The legislature further finds that an improved crisis response system reduces reliance on emergency room services and the use of law enforcement response to behavioral health crises and helps to stabilize individuals in the community whenever possible. To accomplish effective crisis response and suicide prevention, Washington state must continue its integrated approach to address mental health and substance use disorder and continue its progress toward implementing the 988 suicide and crisis lifelines and crisis systems in the country. The legislature finds it is critical to provide funding to enable greater access to crisis care services and supports.</p>
