# HB 2114 - Defective license plates

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2114.pdf)

## Section 1
The department of licensing sells license plates, and sometimes those license plates weather quickly and become illegible. The manufacturer has indicated the license plates will be useable for a number of years, so when the plates delaminate, purchasers are justifiably upset when the replacement for the defective license plate requires payment of fees and taxes. The department of licensing cannot ignore statutory requirements to collect fees and taxes associated with replacement plates. The legislature intends to improve the department of licensing's ability to provide customer service when a license plate fails to last the expected life span by making clear that fees and taxes that were collected when a license plate is initially purchased do not apply when a defective license plate is being replaced.

## Section 2
1. A person who has been issued a license plate that is defective may request replacement license plates for use on the same vehicle within five years of the issuance date. The defect must render the license plate not functional such as, but not limited to, the numbers are no longer legible or the paint is peeling or bubbling. The department may require the defective plate to be removed from the vehicle and submitted with the request for replacement license plates.

2. If the request for replacement occurs on or before the last day of the 24th month from the date of the license plate issuance, no fees or taxes are due. If the request for a replacement license plate occurs after the last day of the 24th month from the date of issuance through and including the five year anniversary of the date of the issuance, the department may collect the cost of the license plate or set of license plates, the filing fee in accordance with RCW 46.17.005, the license service fee in accordance with RCW 46.17.025, the service fee in accordance with RCW 46.17.040(1)(b), and the cost of the tabs depicting the month and year of registration, unless the transaction would otherwise be exempt from such fees, then the exemption still applies.

3. The department is not required to provide a replacement license plate in accordance with subsection (2) of this section in the following circumstances:

    a. The license plate has been tampered with by manual means or was damaged in a vehicle collision with another vehicle, building, or object;

    b. The defective license plate was associated with a vehicle registered as stolen and the person requesting the plate is not the owner or registered person of the vehicle;

    c. The person has already received a replacement for the license plate within five years;

    d. The person has applied for or is submitting an application to transfer the license plate to a different vehicle; or

    e. The department determines the license plate is not associated with a valid registration for the specific vehicle.

4. A person with one defective license plate is eligible to receive a replacement set of license plates unless only one license plate is required by law.

5. For purposes of this section "license plate" includes all license plates that are not temporary plates issued to vehicle owners by the department or by an authorized entity for vehicle licensing.

## Section 3
1. In addition to all other fees and taxes required by law, the department, county auditor or other agent, or subagent appointed by the director shall charge:

    a. The following license plate fees for each license plate, unless the owner or type of vehicle is exempt from payment or a defective plate is being replaced in accordance with section 2 of this act:
