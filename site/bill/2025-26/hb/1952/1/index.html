<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The high cost of implementing a new special license plate series, coupled with the uncertainty of the state's ability to recoup its costs, has led the legislature to delay the implementation of new special license plates. In order to address these issues, it is the intent of the legislature to create a mechanism that will allow for the opportunity to review and evaluate the special license plate process, to ensure efficacy of the program, and to ensure this program does not result in undue costs to the state of Washington. With the creation of a task force, the legislature will be better equipped to efficiently process special license plate legislation.</p>

<li>
<p>This section expires December 1, 2026.</p>
