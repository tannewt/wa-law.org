[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1847-S.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that, as Washington works towards meeting its goals under the clean energy transformation act, we see many larger-scale renewable energy projects proposed. These projects can come with significant challenges. This act aims to incentivize the development of renewable energy on lands and structures that have minimal disruption to natural habitats, communities, cultural resources, and agriculture. This could include small-scale wind energy developments, solar energy developments on landfills, structures, and other developed lands, and the placement of solar panels on agricultural lands that ensure the continued viability of agriculture alongside energy production. Incentivizing distributed energy can help us protect our rich agricultural lands and meet our clean energy goals.

## Section 2
1. The following categories of clean energy facilities and nonproject activities that reduce environmental impacts are determined to constitute distributed energy priorities:

    a. Solar energy generation and accompanying energy storage and electricity transmission and distribution, including vehicle charging equipment, when such facilities are located:

        i. Within the easement, right-of-way, or existing footprint of electrical transmission facilities;

        ii. Within the easement, right-of-way, or existing footprint of a state highway or city or county road;

        iii. On structures over or enclosing irrigation canals, drainage ditches, and irrigation, agricultural, livestock supply, stormwater, or wastewater reservoirs or similar impoundments of state waters that do not host salmon or steelhead trout runs;

        iv. On elevated structures over parking lots;

    v. On lands within a transportation facility, including but not limited to airports and railroad facilities, or restricted from other developments by transportation facility operations;

    vi. On closed or capped portions of landfills;

    vii. On reclaimed or former surface mine lands or contaminated sites that have been remediated under chapter 70A.305 RCW or the federal comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 9601 et seq.) in a manner that includes an asphalt or soil cap;

    viii. As an agrivoltaic facility; and

        ix. On existing structures;

    b. Wind energy generation that is not a utility-scale wind energy facility as defined in RCW 70A.550.010, and accompanying energy storage and transmission and distribution equipment, including vehicle charging equipment;

    c. Energy storage, when such facilities are located:

        i. Within the easement, right-of-way, or existing footprint of electrical transmission facilities;

        ii. Within the easement, right-of-way, or existing footprint of a state highway or city or county road;

        iii. On lands within a transportation facility, including but not limited to airports and railroad facilities, or restricted from other developments by transportation facility operations;

        iv. On closed or capped portions of landfills;

    v. On reclaimed or former surface mine lands;

    vi. On contaminated sites that have been remediated under chapter 70A.305 RCW or the federal comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 9601 et seq.) in a manner that includes an asphalt or soil cap; and

    vii. On or in existing structures;

    d. Programs that reduce electric demand, manage the level or timing of electricity consumption, or provide electricity storage, renewable or nonemitting electric energy, capacity, or ancillary services to an electric utility and that are located on the distribution system, any subsystem of the distribution system, or behind the customer meter, including conservation and energy efficiency; and

    e. Programs that reduce energy demand, manage the level or timing of energy consumption, or provide thermal energy storage.

    a. The department must review and, when appropriate, periodically recommend to the legislature additional types of distributed energy priorities for inclusion on the list under subsection (1) of this section.

    b. The identification of distributed energy priorities in subsection (1) of this section applies to the maximum extent practical under state and federal law, but does not include any development sites or activities prohibited under other state or federal laws.

3. [Empty]

    a. For purposes of this section, "agrivoltaic facility" means a solar energy generation facility designed to be operated coincident with continued productive agricultural use of the land or the provision of ecological value, including habitat, or both.

    b. An agrivoltaic facility must not permanently or significantly degrade the agricultural or ecological productivity of the land after the cessation of the operation of the facility or involve the sale of a water right associated with the land.

    c. An agrivoltaics facility must not cause the temporary or permanent conversion of land from agricultural uses.

    d. An agrivoltaic facility must be designed to continue to produce marketable and measurable agricultural products or ecosystem services under a business plan that considers soils, infrastructure, support services, water access, succession, and market access of any agricultural products to be produced at the facility.

    e. For agrivoltaic facilities featuring continued agricultural production, solar panel arrays must be designed and installed in a manner that supports the continuation of a viable farm operation for the life of the array, and must consider, as appropriate, the availability of light, water infrastructure for crops or animals, and panel height and spacing relative to farm machinery needs.

## Section 3
The department must assist in identifying, coordinating, and implementing opportunities for state government, in its role as a regulator, energy consumer, or possessor of property and assets capable of being used for distributed energy priorities, to facilitate the development of distributed energy priorities identified in section 2 of this act.

Prior to issuing the threshold determination of significance, the lead agency must give the project applicant the option of withdrawing and revising its application and the associated environmental checklist. The lead agency shall make its threshold determination based upon the changed or clarified application and associated environmental checklist. The responsible official has no more than 30 days from the date of the resubmission of a clarified or changed application to make a threshold determination, unless the applicant makes material changes that substantially modify the impact of the proposal, in which case the responsible official must treat the resubmitted clarified or changed application as new, and is subject to the timelines established in RCW 43.21C.033.

    b. The notification required under (a) of this subsection is not an official determination by the lead agency and is not subject to appeal under this chapter.

    c. Nothing in this subsection amends the requirements of RCW 43.21C.033 as they apply to proposals that are not for clean energy projects and nothing in this subsection precludes the lead agency from allowing an applicant for a proposal that is not a clean energy project to follow application processes similar to or the same as the application processes identified in this subsection.

3. [Empty]

    a. When an environmental impact statement is required, a lead agency shall prepare a final environmental impact statement for clean energy projects within 24 months of a threshold determination of a probable significant, adverse environmental impact.

    b. A lead agency may work with clean energy project applicants to set or extend a time limit longer than 24 months under (a) of this subsection, provided the:

        i. Applicant agrees to a longer time limit; and

        ii. Responsible official for the lead agency maintains an updated schedule available for public review.

    c. For all clean energy projects that require the preparation of an environmental impact statement, the lead agency shall work collaboratively with applicants and all agencies that will have actions requiring review under this chapter to develop a schedule that shall:

        i. Include a list of, and roles and responsibilities for, all entities that have actions requiring review under this chapter for the project;

        ii. Include a comprehensive schedule of dates by which review under this chapter will be completed, all actions requiring review under this chapter will be taken, and the public will have an opportunity to participate;

        iii. Be completed within 60 days of issuance of a determination of significance;

        iv. Be updated as needed, but no later than 30 days of missing a date on the schedule; and

    v. Be available for public review on the state environmental policy act register.

    d. A lead agency may fulfill its responsibilities under this subsection with a coordinated project plan prepared pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 4370m–2(c)(1) if it includes all dates identified under (c)(ii) of this subsection.

    e. A failure to comply with the requirements in this subsection is not subject to appeal and does not provide a basis for the invalidation of the review by an agency under this chapter. Nothing in this subsection creates any civil liability for an agency or creates a new cause of action against an agency.

    f. For clean energy projects, the provisions of this subsection are in addition to the requirements of RCW 43.21C.0311.

4. This subsection provides clarifications on the content of review under this chapter specific to clean energy projects.

    a. In defining the proposal that is the subject of review under this chapter, a lead agency may not combine the evaluation of a clean energy project proposal with other proposals unless the:

        i. Proposals are closely related; or

        ii. Applicant agrees to combining the proposals' evaluation.

    b. An agency with authority to impose mitigation under RCW 43.21C.060 may require mitigation measures for clean energy projects only to address the environmental impacts that are attributable to and caused by a proposal.

        ii. For each specific category of such projects, the department of ecology may, as appropriate:

(A) Categorically exempt from compliance with this chapter certain projects. The department may limit the availability of a categorical exemption under this subsection to development actions that do not exceed certain size thresholds or that are carried out in specified circumstances or locations; or

(B) Identify circumstances where it is appropriate to identify standardized mitigation, which may include best management practices, for potential adverse environmental impacts. When implemented, the standardized mitigation developed under this subsection must be considered in a threshold determination under this chapter.

    b. In adopting rules under this subsection, the department must:

        i. Consider the nonproject environmental impact statements prepared pursuant to RCW 43.21C.405 and 43.21C.535;

        ii. Consider applicable rules, guidance, and environmental best management practices adopted by federal agencies, and the scope and applicability of any similar exemptions under federal statute and rules to environmental review requirements under the national environmental policy act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 4321 et seq.; and

        iii. Request and consider input from agencies, federally recognized Indian tribes, stakeholders, local governments, and the public in a manner that satisfies the obligations of chapters 34.05 and 70A.02 RCW, including to assist in the identification of the suitable scope, size thresholds, circumstances, best management practices, and mitigation measures.

    c. In recognition of the state's regulatory requirements, which include 2030 and 2045 compliance deadlines for clean energy under chapter 19.405 RCW, and the urgency of the need to facilitate energy infrastructure developments, the department must aspire to finalize the adoption of rules under this subsection by January 1, 2028, so as to enable the application of the categorical exemptions and standardized mitigation under this subsection as quickly as possible.
