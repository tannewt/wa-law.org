<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that, as Washington works towards meeting its goals under the clean energy transformation act, we see many larger-scale renewable energy projects proposed. These projects can come with significant challenges. This act aims to incentivize the development of renewable energy on lands and structures that have minimal disruption to natural habitats, communities, cultural resources, and agriculture. This could include small-scale wind energy developments, solar energy developments on landfills, structures, and other developed lands, and the placement of solar panels on agricultural lands that ensure the continued viability of agriculture alongside energy production. Incentivizing distributed energy can help us protect our rich agricultural lands and meet our clean energy goals.</p>

<p>After the submission of an environmental checklist and prior to issuing a threshold determination that a clean energy project proposal is likely to cause a probable significant adverse environmental impact consistent with RCW 43.21C.033, the lead agency must notify the project applicant and explain in writing the basis for its anticipated determination of significance.

    i. Consider the nonproject environmental impact statements prepared pursuant to RCW 43.21C.405 and 43.21C.535;

Sec. 4321 et seq.; and

    iii. Request and consider input from agencies, federally recognized Indian tribes, stakeholders, local governments, and the public in a manner that satisfies the obligations of chapters 34.05 and 70A.02 RCW, including to assist in the identification of the suitable scope, size thresholds, circumstances, best management practices, and mitigation measures.

c. In recognition of the state's regulatory requirements, which include 2030 and 2045 compliance deadlines for clean energy under chapter 19.405 RCW, and the urgency of the need to facilitate energy infrastructure developments, the department must aspire to finalize the adoption of rules under this subsection by January 1, 2028, so as to enable the application of the categorical exemptions and standardized mitigation under this subsection as quickly as possible.

<p>When land has once been classified under this chapter, it must remain under such classification and must not be applied to other use except as provided by subsection (2) of this section for at least ten years from the date of classification. It must continue under such classification until and unless withdrawn from classification after notice of request for withdrawal is made by the owner. After the initial 10-year classification period has elapsed, notice of request for withdrawal of all or a portion of the land may be given by the owner to the assessor or assessors of the county or counties in which the land is situated. If a portion of a parcel is removed from classification, the remaining portion must meet the same requirements as did the entire parcel when the land was originally granted classification under this chapter unless the remaining parcel has different income criteria. Within seven days the assessor must transmit one copy of the notice to the legislative body that originally approved the application. The assessor or assessors, as the case may be, must withdraw the land from the classification and the land is subject to the additional tax and applicable interest due under RCW 84.34.108. Agreement to tax according to use is not considered to be a contract and can be abrogated at any time by the legislature in which event no additional tax or penalty may be imposed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the assessor gives written notice of removal as provided in RCW 84.34.108(1)(d)(i) of all or a portion of land classified under this chapter before the owner gives a notice of request for withdrawal in (a) of this subsection, the provisions of RCW 84.34.108 apply.</p>
