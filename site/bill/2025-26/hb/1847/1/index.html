<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that, as Washington works towards meeting its goals under the clean energy transformation act, we see many larger-scale renewable energy projects proposed. These projects can come with significant challenges. This act aims to incentivize the development of renewable energy on lands and structures that have minimal disruption to natural habitats, communities, cultural resources, and agriculture. This could include small-scale wind energy developments, solar energy developments on landfills, structures, and other developed lands, and the placement of solar panels on agricultural lands that ensure the continued viability of agriculture alongside energy production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington state can lead by example, showing commitment to our own clean energy goals by identifying state lands and buildings appropriate for clean energy projects, ensuring that state resources are leveraged to meet our broader goals. Utilities can integrate lower conflict clean energy development into their clean energy targets. Incentivizing distributed energy can help us protect our rich agricultural lands and meet our clean energy goals.</p>

<p>After the submission of an environmental checklist and prior to issuing a threshold determination that a clean energy project proposal is likely to cause a probable significant adverse environmental impact consistent with RCW 43.21C.033, the lead agency must notify the project applicant and explain in writing the basis for its anticipated determination of significance. Prior to issuing the threshold determination of significance, the lead agency must give the project applicant the option of withdrawing and revising its application and the associated environmental checklist. The lead agency shall make its threshold determination based upon the changed or clarified application and associated environmental checklist. The responsible official has no more than 30 days from the date of the resubmission of a clarified or changed application to make a threshold determination, unless the applicant makes material changes that substantially modify the impact of the proposal, in which case the responsible official must treat the resubmitted clarified or changed application as new, and is subject to the timelines established in RCW 43.21C.033.</p>

For each specific category of such projects, the department of ecology may, as appropriate:</li>
</ol>

<p>(A) Categorically exempt from compliance with this chapter certain projects.

<p>(B) Identify circumstances where it is appropriate to identify standardized mitigation, which may include best management practices, for potential adverse environmental impacts. When implemented, the standardized mitigation developed under this subsection must be considered in a threshold determination under this chapter.</p>
<pre><code>    ii. The categorical exemption or standardized mitigation available under this subsection must, at minimum, be available, under specified circumstances, to proposed actions related to the:

<p>(B) Construction of structures with a footprint of less than 1,000 square feet that support solar energy generation panels or other equipment, if the construction of such structures is not undertaken wholly or partly on lands covered by water.</p>
<pre><code>b. In adopting rules under this subsection, the department must:

    i. Consider the nonproject environmental impact statements prepared pursuant to RCW 43.21C.405 and 43.21C.535;

    ii. Consider applicable rules, guidance, and environmental best management practices adopted by federal agencies, and the scope and applicability of any similar exemptions under federal statute and rules to environmental review requirements under the national environmental policy act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 4321 et seq.; and

    iii. Request and consider input from agencies, federally recognized Indian tribes, stakeholders, local governments, and the public in a manner that satisfies the obligations of chapters 34.05 and 70A.02 RCW, including to assist in the identification of the suitable scope, size thresholds, circumstances, best management practices, and mitigation measures.

c. In recognition of the state's regulatory requirements, which include 2030 and 2045 compliance deadlines for clean energy under chapter 19.405 RCW, and the urgency of the need to facilitate energy infrastructure developments, the department must aspire to finalize the adoption of rules under this subsection by January 1, 2028, so as to enable the application of the categorical exemptions and standardized mitigation under this subsection as quickly as possible.
