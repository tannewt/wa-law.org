[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2351-S.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that undue interference with emergency responders working to mitigate an ongoing emergency or disaster can obstruct emergency response operations and endanger the lives and property of the residents of Washington. It is the intent of the legislature to preserve the integrity of emergency response operations, protect the rights and safety of all emergency responders, and to ensure due process of law throughout the state.

## Section 2
1. A person is guilty of obstructing an emergency responder if the person willfully hinders, delays, or obstructs any emergency responder in the discharge of his or her official powers or duties if the emergency responder is in uniform, announces he or she is an emergency responder, and a reasonable person would understand based on the totality of the circumstances that he or she is an emergency responder.
