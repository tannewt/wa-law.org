<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The person committing the violation of subsection (1) of this section furnished the Washington state attorney general with all information known to him or her about the violation within 30 days after the date on which he or she first obtained the information;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The person fully cooperated with any investigation by the attorney general of the violation; and</p>
</li>

<p>Any information furnished pursuant to this chapter is exempt from public inspection and copying under the public records act, chapter 42.56 RCW, until final disposition and all court-ordered seals are lifted.</p>
<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
<p>The attorney general must diligently investigate a violation under section 3 of this act. If the attorney general finds that a person has violated or is violating section 3 of this act, the attorney general may bring a civil action under this section against the person.</p>
<h2 id="section-6">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A person may bring a civil action for a violation of section 3 of this act for the person and for the state. The action may be known as a qui tam action and the person bringing the action as a qui tam relator. The action must be brought in the name of the state. The action may be dismissed only if the court and the attorney general give written consent to the dismissal and their reason for consenting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A relator filing an action under this chapter must serve a copy of the complaint and written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information the person possesses on the attorney general in electronic format. The relator must file the complaint in camera. The complaint must remain under seal for at least 60 days, and may not be served on the defendant until the court so orders. The attorney general may elect to intervene and proceed with the action within 60 days after it receives both the complaint and the material evidence and information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The attorney general may, for good cause shown, move the court for extensions of the time during which the complaint remains under seal under subsection (2) of this section. The motions may be supported by affidavits or other submissions in camera. The defendant may not be required to respond to any complaint filed under this section until 20 days after the complaint is unsealed and served upon the defendant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the attorney general does not proceed with the action prior to the expiration of the 60-day period or any extensions obtained under subsection (3) of this section, then the relator has the right to conduct the action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a person brings an action under this section, no person other than the attorney general may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-7">Section 7 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the attorney general proceeds with the qui tam action, the attorney general shall have the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action, and is not bound by an act of the relator. The relator has the right to continue as a party to the action, subject to the limitations set forth in subsection (2) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The attorney general may move to dismiss the qui tam action notwithstanding the objections of the relator if the relator has been notified by the attorney general of the filing of the motion and the court has provided the relator with an opportunity for a hearing on the motion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The attorney general may settle the action with the defendant notwithstanding the objections of the relator if the court determines, after a hearing, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable under all the circumstances. Upon a showing of good cause, the hearing may be held in camera.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon a showing by the attorney general that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the relator would interfere with or unduly delay the attorney general's prosecution of the case, or would be repetitious, irrelevant, or for purposes of harassment, the court may, in its discretion, impose limitations on the relator's participation, such as:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Limiting the number of witnesses the relator may call;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limiting the length of the testimony of the witnesses;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limiting the relator's cross-examination of witnesses; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise limiting the participation by the relator in the litigation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon a showing by the defendant that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the relator would be for purposes of harassment or would cause the defendant undue burden or unnecessary expense, the court may limit the participation by the relator in the litigation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the attorney general elects not to proceed with the qui tam action, the relator has the right to conduct the action. If the attorney general so requests, the relator must serve on the attorney general copies of all pleadings filed in the action and shall supply copies of all deposition transcripts, at the attorney general's expense. When the relator proceeds with the action, the court, without limiting the status and rights of the relator, may nevertheless permit the attorney general to intervene at a later date upon a showing of good cause.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether or not the attorney general proceeds with the qui tam action, upon a showing by the attorney general that certain actions of discovery by the relator would interfere with the attorney general's investigation or prosecution of a criminal or civil matter arising out of the same facts, the court may stay such discovery for a period of not more than 60 days. The showing must be conducted in camera. The court may extend the 60-day period upon a further showing in camera that the attorney general has pursued the criminal or civil investigation or proceedings with reasonable diligence and any proposed discovery in the civil action will interfere with the ongoing criminal or civil investigation or proceedings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding section 6 of this act, the attorney general may elect to pursue its claim through any alternate remedy available to the state, including any administrative proceeding to determine a civil money penalty. If any alternate remedy is pursued in another proceeding, the relator has the same rights in the proceeding as the relator would have had if the action had continued under this section. Any finding of fact or conclusion of law made in the other proceeding that has become final is conclusive on all parties to an action under this section. For purposes of this subsection, a finding or conclusion is final if it has been finally determined on appeal to the appropriate court of the state of Washington, if all time for filing the appeal with respect to the finding or conclusion has expired, or if the finding or conclusion is not subject to judicial review.</p>

<li>
<p>Subject to (b) of this subsection, if the attorney general proceeds with a qui tam action, the relator must receive at least 15 percent but not more than 25 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim, depending upon the extent to which the relator substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where the action is one which the court finds to be based primarily on disclosures of specific information, other than information provided by the relator, relating to allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a legislative or administrative report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, the court may award an amount it considers appropriate, but in no case more than 10 percent of the proceeds, taking into account the significance of the information and the role of the relator in advancing the case to litigation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any payment to a relator under (a) or (b) of this subsection must be made from the proceeds. The relator must also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. All expenses, fees, and costs must be awarded against the defendant.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the attorney general does not proceed with a qui tam action, the relator shall receive an amount which the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages. The amount may not be less than 25 percent and not more than 30 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement and must be paid out of the proceeds. The relator must also receive an amount for reasonable expenses that the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. All expenses, fees, and costs must be awarded against the defendant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether or not the attorney general proceeds with the qui tam action, if the court finds that the action was brought by a person who planned and initiated the violation of section 3 of this act upon which the action was brought, then the court may, to the extent the court considers appropriate, reduce the share of the proceeds of the action which the person would otherwise receive under subsection (1) or (2) of this section, taking into account the role of that person in advancing the case to litigation and any relevant circumstances pertaining to the violation. If the person bringing the action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from his or her role in the violation of section 3 of this act, that person must be dismissed from the civil action and may not receive any share of the proceeds of the action. The dismissal may not prejudice the right of the state to continue the action, represented by the attorney general.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the attorney general does not proceed with the qui tam action and the relator conducts the action, the court may award to the defendant reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds that the claim of the relator was clearly frivolous, clearly vexatious, or brought primarily for purposes of harassment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any funds recovered that remain after calculation and distribution under subsections (1) through (3) of this section must be remitted to the state treasurer and deposited into the state general fund.</p>

<li>
<p>In a state criminal, civil, or administrative hearing in which the attorney general or other state entity is a party;</p>

<p>Dismissal of an action is not required under (a) of this subsection if the action is brought by the attorney general or the relator is an original source of the information.</p>

<p>For purposes of this section, &quot;original source&quot; means an individual who either:</p>

<p>Prior to a public disclosure under (a) of this subsection, has voluntarily disclosed to the attorney general the information on which allegations or transactions in a claim are based; or</p>

<p>Any employee, contractor, or agent is entitled to all relief necessary to make that employee, contractor, or agent whole, if that employee, contractor, or agent is discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment because of lawful acts done by the employee, contractor, agent, or associated others in furtherance of an action under this chapter or other efforts to stop one or more violations of this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relief under subsection (1) of this section must include reinstatement with the same seniority status that employee, contractor, or agent would have had but for the discrimination, two times the amount of back pay, interest on the back pay, and compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of the discrimination, including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys' fees, and any and all relief available under RCW 49.60.030(2). An action under this subsection may be brought in the appropriate superior court of the state of Washington for the relief provided in this subsection.</p>

<p>If the attorney general elects to intervene and proceed with a qui tam action, the attorney general may file its own complaint or amend the complaint of a relator to clarify or add detail to the claims in which the attorney general is intervening and to add any additional claims with respect to which the attorney general contends it is entitled to relief. For statute of limitations purposes, any such pleading by the attorney general shall relate back to the filing date of the complaint of the person who originally brought the action, to the extent that the attorney general's claim arises out of the conduct, transactions, or occurrences set forth, or attempted to be set forth, in the prior complaint of that person.</p>

<li>
<p>In any action brought under section 5 or 6 of this act, the attorney general is required to prove all essential elements of the cause of action, including damages, by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>

<li>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of law or the rules for superior court, a final judgment rendered in favor of the state in any criminal proceeding charging fraud or false statements, whether upon a verdict after trial or upon a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, estops the defendant from denying the essential elements of the offense in any action which involves the same transaction as in the criminal proceeding and which is brought under section 5 or 6 of this act.</p>
