2. [Empty]

    a. A district that includes all the territory within the boundaries of the jurisdiction, or jurisdictions, establishing the district may impose by a majority vote of the governing board of the district up to: (i) $20 of the vehicle fee authorized in subsection (1) of this section, (ii) $40 of the vehicle fee authorized in subsection (1) of this section if a $20 vehicle fee has been imposed for at least 24 months, or (iii) $50 of the vehicle fee authorized in subsection (1) of this section if a vehicle fee of $40 has been imposed for at least 24 months and a district has met the requirements of RCW 36.73.065(6).

If the district is countywide, the revenues of the fee must be distributed to each city within the district by interlocal agreement. The interlocal agreement is effective when approved by the district and 60 percent of the cities representing 75 percent of the population of the cities within the district in which the countywide fee is collected.

    b. A district may not impose a fee under this subsection (2):

        i. For a passenger-only ferry transportation improvement unless the vehicle fee is first approved by a majority of the voters within the jurisdiction of the district; or

        ii. That, if combined with the fees previously imposed by another district within its boundaries under RCW 36.73.065(4)(a)(i), exceeds $50.

If a district imposes or increases a fee under this subsection (2) that, if combined with the fees previously imposed by another district within its boundaries, exceeds $50, the district shall provide a credit for the previously imposed fees so that the combined vehicle fee does not exceed $50.

3. The department of licensing shall administer and collect the fee. The department shall deduct a percentage amount, as provided by contract, not to exceed one percent of the fees collected, for administration and collection expenses incurred by it. The department shall remit remaining proceeds to the custody of the state treasurer. The state treasurer shall distribute the proceeds to the district on a monthly basis.

4. No fee under this section may be collected until six months after approval under RCW 36.73.065.

5. The vehicle fee under this section applies only when renewing a vehicle registration, and is effective upon the registration renewal date as provided by the department of licensing.

6. The following vehicles are exempt from the fee under this section:

    a. Campers, as defined in RCW 46.04.085;
