<p>Except as provided in RCW 35A.11.090, and except that the number of registered voters needed to sign a petition for initiative or referendum shall be 25 percent of the total number of votes cast for the citywide race receiving the greatest number of votes or, if there was no citywide race, the number of votes cast for all candidates for city council, at the last preceding city general election, the powers of initiative and referendum in noncharter code cities shall be exercised in the manner set forth for the commission form of government in RCW 35.17.240 through 35.17.360, as now or hereafter amended.</p>
<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
<p>Upon the filing of a referendum petition praying therefor, the legislative authority shall reconsider an ordinance subject to referendum and upon reconsideration shall defeat it in its entirety or shall submit it to a vote of the people. The operation of an ordinance so protested against shall be suspended until the referendum petition is finally found insufficient or until the ordinance protested against has received a majority of the votes cast thereon at the election.</p>
<h2 id="section-6">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ordinances may be initiated by petition of registered voters of the city filed with the commission legislative authority. If the petition accompanying the proposed ordinance is signed by the registered voters in the city equal in number to twenty-five percent of the votes cast for all candidates for mayor the citywide race receiving the greatest number of votes, or, if there was no citywide race, the number of votes cast for all candidates for city council at the last preceding city election, and if it contains a request that, unless passed by the commission legislative authority, the ordinance be submitted to a vote of the registered voters of the city, the commission legislative authority shall either:</p>

<h2 id="section-8">Section 8 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-8">¶</a></h2>
<p>Within ten days from the filing of a petition submitting a proposed ordinance the city clerk shall ascertain and append to the petition his or her certificate stating whether or not it is signed by a sufficient number of registered voters, using the registration records and returns of the preceding municipal election for his or her sources of information, and the legislative authority shall allow him or her extra help for that purpose, if necessary. If the signatures are found by the clerk to be insufficient the petition may be amended in that respect within ten days from the date of the certificate. Within ten days after submission of the amended petition the clerk shall make an examination thereof and append his or her certificate thereto in the same manner as before. If the second certificate shall also show the number of signatures to be insufficient, the petition shall be returned to the person filing it.</p>
<h2 id="section-9">Section 9 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9">¶</a></h2>
<p>If the clerk finds the petition insufficient or if the legislative authority refuses either to pass an initiative ordinance or order an election thereon, any taxpayer may commence an action in the superior court against the city and procure a decree ordering an election to be held in the city for the purpose of voting upon the proposed ordinance if the court finds the petition to be sufficient.</p>
<h2 id="section-10">Section 10 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-10">¶</a></h2>
<p>If the number of votes cast thereon favor the unaltered proposed ordinance, it shall become effective immediately and shall be made a part of the record of ordinances of the city. If the number of votes cast thereon instead favor a modified or alternative ordinance, then only that ordinance is effective and must be made a part of the record of ordinances of the city. If a majority of voters vote to reject both an unaltered ordinance and a modified or alternative ordinance, then neither is enacted or effective.</p>
<h2 id="section-11">Section 11 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-11">¶</a></h2>

Thereafter, the ordinance may additionally be amended or repealed by the city legislative authority if at least two-thirds of the members of the city legislative authority vote in favor of amendment or repeal.</p>
<h2 id="section-12">Section 12 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-12">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislative authority may by means of an ordinance submit a proposition for the repeal or amendment of an ordinance, initiated by petition, by submitting it to a vote of the people at any general election and if a majority of the votes cast upon the proposition favor it, the ordinance shall be repealed or amended accordingly.</p>
<p>A proposition of repeal or amendment must be published before the election thereon as is an ordinance initiated by petition when submitted to election.</p>
<h2 id="section-13">Section 13 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-13">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>

Any charter city that does not provide for direct legislation by initiative and referendum that meets the population threshold of 30,000 after the effective date of this section must cause a ballot proposition for amending the charter of the city to provide for direct legislation as provided for in RCW 35.17.230 through 35.17.360 to be submitted to voters for approval at the next general election occurring more than 90 days after the population threshold is reached.</p>

<li>
<p>The mayor and council and such other elective officers as may be provided for in such charter shall be elected at such times and in such manner as provided in Title 29A RCW, and for such terms and shall perform such duties as may be prescribed in the charter, and shall receive compensation in accordance with the process or standards of a charter provision or ordinance which conforms with RCW 35.21.015.</p>
