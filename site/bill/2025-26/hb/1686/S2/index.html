<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<p>a. Washington's health care landscape is changing rapidly. A 2023 report by the office of the insurance commissioner identified that Washington has experienced substantial horizontal consolidation and vertical integration across health care providers, facilities, and insurers;</p>
<ol type="a" start="2">
<li>
<p>Washington's health care market is also experiencing investment from new for-profit entities such as private equity firms. While there were only four private equity acquisitions in Washington in 2014, this number had grown to 97 by 2023;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These changes to Washington's health care landscape have not resolved access and affordability challenges. A 2024 survey of over 1,000 Washingtonians found that over half skipped needed care due to cost. Department of health data indicates substantial health disparities based on geographic location. Many rural Washingtonians experience health care deserts for essential care; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>d. Washington is currently unable to evaluate how changes in the health care landscape are impacting access and affordability because the state lacks a complete and transparent registry of health care systems and entities. While the state collects some information about health insurers through annual financial statement filing requirements, there is no similar information available for other kinds of health care systems and entities. The office of financial management identified this critical data infrastructure gap in 2010, but it has not yet been resolved. Recent reports in 2023 and 2024 by the office of financial management, the office of the insurance commissioner, and the health care cost transparency board have indicated this data gap continues to prevent effective stewardship of health care resources and state health planning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to monitor and measure changes in the health care landscape to better understand trends in health care market consolidation, with the goal of improving access and affordability. The legislature aims to accelerate transparency about large health care systems and entities first, prioritizing data collection at the holding company or parent entity level to inform the development of a more complete, interactive registry that includes all health care entities and providers over time.</p>
