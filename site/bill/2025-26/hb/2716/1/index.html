<ol>
<li>
<p>This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preference contained in section 1, chapter . . ., Laws of 2026 (section 1 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature categorizes the tax preference created under this act as intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(a).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Induce participating utilities to enhance offerings of energy assistance to customers who have exhausted other forms of energy assistance; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To support the progress of making energy assistance funds available to low-income households consistent with RCW 19.405.120.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>As part of its 2030 tax preference reviews, the joint legislative audit and review committee must review the tax preference in section 1 of this act and formerly RCW 82.16.0497. The legislature intends for the legislative auditor to determine that the incentive has achieved its desired outcomes if the following objectives are achieved:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Energy assistance is provided in an amount greater than amounts otherwise provided under other state, federal, and utility funded programs; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proceeds from the tax credit provided under section 1 of this act and formerly RCW 82.16.0497 are used to demonstrate progress toward making energy assistance funds available to low-income customers consistent the policies identified in RCW 19.405.120.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>All recipients of tax credits or incentive payments awarded under section 1 of this act must provide data necessary to evaluate the tax preference performance objectives in this section as requested by the joint legislative audit and review committee. Failure to comply may result in the loss of a tax credit award or incentive payment in the following fiscal year. The joint legislative audit and review committee must notify the department of revenue by June 30th of each year if a light and power business credit, as established in section 1 of this act, is suspended due to failure to comply with providing data as required in this subsection.</p>
</li>
