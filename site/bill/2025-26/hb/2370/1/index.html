<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the state can support individuals experiencing homelessness by requiring participation in substance use treatment, when assessed as a need, as a condition of receiving housing services, promoting recovery and long-term stability. The legislature further finds that standardized reporting and monitoring can ensure prioritization of results-oriented decision making in funding housing programs. Therefore, the legislature intends to establish clear expectations for substance use treatment and ensure individuals in transitional or permanent supportive housing receive the care they need, while maintaining accountability and not tacitly approving ongoing substance use. The legislature further intends to strengthen accountability and oversight of state-funded housing programs and ensure accurate, reliable data is provided on effectiveness and outcomes.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
