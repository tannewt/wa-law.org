# HB 2667 - AI consumer protections

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2667.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that artificial intelligence is a dynamic technology that is changing the way Washingtonians live, learn, and work. Emerging artificial intelligence technologies seek to enhance information gathering and decision making, create new efficiencies throughout the economy, and advance scientific discovery. The legislature also recognizes that there are potential risks associated with the rapid development and deployment of artificial intelligence systems, including the generation of bias and unintentional discrimination. These risks are especially profound when an artificial intelligence system is used to make decisions that have a material or legal impact on someone's life.

The legislature recognizes Washington's role as a leader and innovator within the high-technology economy. The legislature intends to adopt an artificial intelligence regulatory framework that continues to promote innovation, reduce risk, and protect residents from discriminatory actions. The legislature further recognizes that regulatory frameworks that align with national standards and specify clear compliance requirements provide developers with certainty to support continued innovation while also protecting consumers from unfair or unclear artificial intelligence decisions.

Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to protect Washingtonians from algorithmic discrimination by establishing a comprehensive risk-based approach to artificial intelligence accountability. The legislature intends to regulate deployers of artificial intelligence under the presumption that they are acting in good faith when they comply with the provisions of this act. The legislature also intends to ensure that government agencies are transparent and accountable by requiring disclosure when consumer interactions are supported by an artificial intelligence system. Finally, the legislature intends to extend and expand the work of the artificial intelligence task force to develop a framework for the adoption of artificial intelligence in the workplace in a way that centers workers and protects fairness and opportunity.

In any enforcement action brought on or after July 1, 2027, by the attorney general pursuant to section 9 of this act, there is a rebuttable presumption that a deployer of a high-risk artificial intelligence system used reasonable care as required under this section if the deployer complied with this chapter.

2. [Empty]

    a. By July 1, 2027, and at least annually thereafter, a deployer or third party contracted by the deployer shall review the deployment of each high-risk artificial intelligence system deployed by the deployer to ensure that the high-risk artificial intelligence system is not causing algorithmic discrimination.

    b. If a deployer subsequently discovers that the high-risk artificial intelligence system has caused algorithmic discrimination, the deployer, without unreasonable delay, but no later than 90 days after the date of the discovery, shall send to the attorney general, in a form and manner prescribed by the attorney general, a notice disclosing the discovery.

3. Nothing in this section may be construed to require a deployer to disclose any trade secret, or other confidential or proprietary information.

2. [Empty]

    a. The risk management policy and program must specify and incorporate the principles, processes, and personnel that the deployer uses to identify, document, and mitigate known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination. The risk management policy and program must include an iterative process that is planned, implemented, and regularly and systematically reviewed and updated over the lifecycle of the high-risk artificial intelligence system.

    b. A risk management policy and program implemented and maintained pursuant to this subsection must be reasonable, considering:

        i. The size and complexity of the deployer;

        ii. The nature and scope of the high-risk artificial intelligence systems deployed by the deployer including, but not limited to, the intended uses of such high-risk artificial intelligence systems;

(A) Adheres to the guidance and standards set forth in the latest version of the artificial intelligence risk management framework published by the national institute of standards and technology, ISO/IEC 42001, or another nationally or internationally recognized risk management framework for artificial intelligence systems, if the standards are substantially equivalent to or more stringent than the requirements; or

(B) Complies with any risk management framework for artificial intelligence systems that the attorney general, in the attorney general's discretion, may designate.

    c. A risk management policy and program implemented and maintained pursuant to this subsection (2) may cover multiple high-risk artificial intelligence systems deployed by the deployer.

3. Nothing in this section may be construed to require a deployer to disclose any trade secret, or other confidential or proprietary information.

## Section 5
1. Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, a deployer that deploys a high-risk artificial intelligence system on or after July 1, 2027, or a third party contracted by the deployer for such purposes, shall complete an impact assessment for:

    b. A deployed high-risk artificial intelligence system no later than 90 days after any intentional and substantial modification to such high-risk artificial intelligence system is made available.

2. Each impact assessment completed pursuant to this section must include, at a minimum, and to the extent reasonably known by, or available to, the deployer:

    a. A statement by the deployer disclosing the purpose, intended use cases and deployment context of, and benefits afforded by, the high-risk artificial intelligence system;

    b. An analysis of whether the deployment of the high-risk artificial intelligence system poses any known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination and, if so, the nature of such algorithmic discrimination and the steps that have been taken to mitigate such risks;

    v. A description of the postdeployment monitoring and user safeguards provided concerning such high-risk artificial intelligence system, such as the oversight process established by the deployer to address issues arising from deployment of such high-risk artificial intelligence system.

3. In addition to the information required under subsection (2)(c) of this section, each impact assessment completed following an intentional and substantial modification made to a high-risk artificial intelligence system on or after July 1, 2027, must include a statement disclosing the extent to which the high-risk artificial intelligence system was used in a manner that was consistent with, or varied from, the developer's intended uses of such high-risk artificial intelligence system.

4. A single impact assessment may address a comparable set of high-risk artificial intelligence systems deployed by a deployer.

5. If a deployer, or a third party contracted by the deployer, completes an impact assessment for the purpose of complying with another applicable law or regulation, such impact assessment satisfies the requirements established in this section if such impact assessment is reasonably similar in scope and effect to the impact assessment that would otherwise be completed pursuant to this subsection.

6. A deployer shall maintain the most recently completed impact assessment for a high-risk artificial intelligence system as required under this section, relevant records supporting the impact assessment, and prior impact assessments, if any, for a period of at least three years following the final deployment of the high-risk artificial intelligence system.

    viii. Effectuate a product recall;

        ix. Identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality; or

    x. Assist another developer, deployer, or person with any of the obligations imposed under this chapter;
