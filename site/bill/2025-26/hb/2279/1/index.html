<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the federal government approves pesticides known to contain perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS chemicals, as active ingredients for use in certain agricultural applications. The legislature further finds that these chemicals have been known to remain in the environment for long periods of time and negatively impact human health, and are thus sometimes referred to as &quot;forever chemicals.&quot; Recognizing that protecting the safety of Washington's agricultural crops is critical to ensuring food security, the legislature intends to direct the department of agriculture to evaluate fertilizer and pesticide products that may be used in agricultural production, and establish evaluation criteria for the registration of products with PFAS chemicals as active ingredients.</p>
