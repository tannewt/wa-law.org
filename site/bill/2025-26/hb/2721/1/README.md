2. A business primarily engaged in, or representing itself as primarily being engaged in, the sale or distribution of furniture, fixtures, or equipment is not eligible for registration as a registered commercial interior design firm. This does not prohibit collaboration with such businesses for client-directed procurement or specification services, nor prevent an individual registered commercial interior designer employed by such a business from maintaining individual registration.

3. The business entity shall furnish the board with such information about its organization and activities as the board shall require by rule.
