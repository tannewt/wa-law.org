# HB 1780 - Doctor title/health provider

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1780.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. The terms and titles used by health care professionals in clinical settings play a critical role in ensuring transparency and trust between patients and their providers. Misunderstandings about a health care provider's credentials can lead to patient confusion, erode trust, and impact the quality of care;

    b. While physician assistants and advanced registered nurse practitioners are highly trained professionals who provide essential care, they are not licensed physicians or osteopathic physicians. The use of the title "doctor" in clinical settings, without clear clarification, may inadvertently lead patients to believe that these providers have attained a doctor of medicine or doctor of osteopathic medicine degree, which require different training and scope of practice;

    c. Many patients may not fully understand the distinctions between different health care credentials. Studies have shown that clarity in provider titles improves patient satisfaction and ensures that individuals are better informed about the qualifications of the professionals treating them; and

    d. Protecting patients from potential misrepresentation is critical to maintaining the integrity of the health care system. Transparency in provider titles allows patients to make informed decisions and understand the roles of each member of their care team.

2. The legislature intends to prohibit physician assistants and advanced registered nurse practitioners from referring to themselves as "doctor" in clinical settings. This policy is designed to preserve trust, ensure transparency, and protect patients from unnecessary confusion about the qualifications of their health care providers.
