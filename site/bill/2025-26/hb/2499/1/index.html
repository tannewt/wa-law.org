<li>
<p>If the commission finds the project practicable, it shall appoint two supervisors who shall be qualified by training and experience to perform the specialized skilled services required of them. They, with the three elected supervisors,  shall constitute the governing board of the district.</p>

<li>
<p>The two appointed supervisors shall file with the secretary of state a sworn application, reciting that a petition was filed with the commission for the creation of the district; that all required proceedings were had thereon; that they were appointed by the commission as such supervisors; and that the application is being filed to complete the organization of the district. It shall contain the names and residences of the applicants, a certified copy of their appointments, the name of the district, the location of the office of the supervisors and the term of office of each applicant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application shall be accompanied by a statement of the commission, reciting that a petition was filed, notice issued, and hearing held thereon as required; that it determined the need for the district and defined the boundaries thereof; that notice was given and an election held on the question of creating the district; that a majority vote favored the district, and that the commission had determined the district practicable; and shall set forth the boundaries of the district.</p>

<p>Within thirty days after the issuance of the certificate of organization, unless the time is extended by the commission, petitions shall be filed with the commission to nominate candidates for the three elected supervisors. The petition shall be signed by not less than twenty-five district electors, and a district elector may sign petitions nominating more than one person. Within one week of the filing of a petition, the commission shall transmit the name and contact information of the candidate to the public disclosure commission.</p>

<p>In the case of a new district, the commission shall give due notice to elect the three supervisors. All provisions pertaining to elections on the creation of a district shall govern this election so far as applicable. The names of all nominees shall appear on the ballot in alphabetical order, together with instructions to vote for three. The three candidates receiving the most votes shall be declared elected supervisors, the one receiving the most being elected for a three-year term, the next for two and the last for one year. An alternate method of dividing the district into three zones may be used when requested by the board of supervisors and approved by the commission. In such case, instructions will be to vote for one in each zone. The candidate receiving the most votes in a zone shall be declared elected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each year after the creation of the first board of supervisors, the board shall by resolution and by giving due notice, set a date during the first quarter of each calendar year at which time it shall conduct an election, except that for elections in 2002 only, the board shall set the date during the second quarter of the calendar year at which time it shall conduct an election. Names of candidates nominated by petition shall appear in alphabetical order on the ballots, together with an extra line wherein may be written in the name of any other candidate. The commission shall establish procedures for elections, canvass the returns and announce the official results thereof. Election results may be announced by polling officials at the close of the election subject to official canvass of ballots by the commission. Supervisors elected shall take office at the first board meeting following the election.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A district board of supervisors may choose to conduct the election of supervisors subject to Title 29A RCW. Such change by the district board of supervisors must be made by a vote of a majority of the district supervisors following public notice and a hearing on the proposal. The district shall notify the commission of the proposed motion and public notice of the action. In the event a district chooses to conduct the election subject to Title 29A RCW, rules and guidance developed by the commission for the conduct of supervisor elections do not apply and the district shall comply with all provisions of Title 29A RCW.</p>
