<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>Except as provided in section 2 of this act, any alien may acquire and hold lands, or any right thereto, or interest therein, by purchase, devise, or descent; and he or she may convey, mortgage, and devise the same, and if he or she shall die intestate, the same shall descend to his or her heirs, and in all cases such lands shall be held, conveyed, mortgaged, or devised, or shall descend in like manner and with like effect as if such alien were a native citizen of this state or of the United States.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of all citizens of Washington, on and after July 1, 2025, no foreign adversary shall acquire any interest in agricultural land in this state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any acquisition of any interest in agricultural land in violation of this section shall be void, and title to such interest in agricultural land shall be deemed to have vested as of the date of such purported acquisition in the name of the state of Washington without any payment of consideration of any kind by the state. The foreign adversary purporting to acquire such interest in agricultural land shall be barred from making a claim against any party for restitution of the purchase price paid by such foreign adversary in connection with such interest in agricultural land or for any other kind of payment relating to the foreign adversary's loss or lack of title to such interest in agricultural land. Any lien that has attached to such interest in agricultural land during the foreign adversary's purported acquisition or ownership shall remain a valid lien against the interest during such time as the interest is held by the state except that such lien shall not be subject to foreclosure during the period of the state's ownership nor shall the state be subject to the terms of any agreement giving rise to the lien. The state may hold or dispose of such interest in agricultural land in any lawful manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding the provisions in subsection (2) of this section, if the foreign adversary has subsequently sold or transferred the interest in agricultural land to a person or entity that is not a foreign adversary, title to such interest in agricultural land shall be vested in the subsequent nonforeign adversary purchaser or transferee and shall be valid as if the purported acquisition of such interest in agricultural land by a foreign adversary had not occurred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an interest in agricultural land has been acquired in violation of this section, a county, city, or attorney for the locality in which the agricultural land is located, the attorney general, or any nonforeign adversary person that was a party to the void transaction or is a subsequent holder of such interest may file an action: (a) To eject the foreign adversary from possession; (b) to quiet title to such property; or (c) for any other appropriate action to ratify the nullification of the transaction. Any action brought pursuant to this subsection must be filed in the superior court for the county where the subject property is located.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section shall not be applied in a manner inconsistent with any provision of any treaty between the United States and another country.</p>
</li>
</ol>
