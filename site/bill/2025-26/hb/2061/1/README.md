# HB 2061 - Duty-free sales enterprises

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2061.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that federal law in 19 U.S.C. Sec. 1555 recognizes the authority of states and governmental authorities, incident to their jurisdiction over any airport, seaport, or other exit point facility, to require a concession or other form of approval to be obtained with respect to the operation of a duty-free sales enterprise under which merchandise is delivered to or through such facility for exportation.

2. The legislature finds that congress in enacting the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988, H.R. 4848, specifically recognized that concession fees derived from the operations of authorized duty-free sales enterprises constitute an important source of revenue for the state and other governmental authorities that collect such fees.

3. The legislature finds that duty-free sales enterprises operate in Washington including at airports and locations within Washington near international borders, and engage in sales of alcohol, cigarettes, other tobacco products, vapor products, nicotine products, and various kinds of merchandise. The legislature finds that Washington has jurisdiction over these facilities, locations, and duty-free sales enterprises operating in Washington, and that Washington does not currently require concession fees of duty-free sales enterprises to the extent authorized by federal law for collecting this important source of revenue.

4. Therefore, the legislature intends to impose concession fees on duty-free sales enterprises operating within Washington as provided in this act.

## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Concession fee" means payment of a monetary fee by a duty-free sales enterprise to Washington state in relation to the sale of merchandise from a duty-free sales enterprise operating in Washington.

2. "Department" means the department of revenue.

3. "Duty-free sales enterprise" has the same meaning as in 19 U.S.C. Sec. 1555(b)(8), as it exists on the effective date of this section, or such subsequent date as may be provided by the department by rule, consistent with the purposes of this title.

4. "Gross proceeds of sales" has the same meaning as in RCW 82.04.070.

## Section 3
1. Upon every duty-free sales enterprise operating in Washington, there is levied and collected a concession fee in an amount equal to the gross proceeds of sales of merchandise by the duty-free sales enterprise, multiplied by the rate of 0.10.

2. The concession fee in this section is separate and in addition to business and occupation taxes and all other taxes and fees applicable to duty-free sales enterprises operating in Washington including a concession fee paid to a port authority or other governmental authority.

3. The department shall implement this chapter and may establish procedures and requirements for the payment of concession fees by duty-free sales enterprises and the collection of such concession fees.

## Section 4

## Section 5
Every airport and other air navigation facility controlled and operated by any municipality, or jointly controlled and operated pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, shall, subject to federal and state laws, rules, and regulations, including sections 2 through 4 of this act, be under the exclusive jurisdiction and control of the municipality or municipalities controlling and operating it. The municipality or municipalities shall have concurrent jurisdiction over the adjacent territory described in RCW 14.08.120(1)(b). No other municipality in which the airport or air navigation facility is located shall have any police jurisdiction of the same or any authority to charge or exact any license fees or occupation taxes for the operations. However, by agreement with the municipality operating and controlling the airport or air navigation facility, a municipality in which an airport or air navigation facility is located may be responsible for the administration and enforcement of the uniform fire code, as adopted by that municipality under RCW 19.27.040, on that portion of any airport or air navigation facility located within its jurisdictional boundaries.
