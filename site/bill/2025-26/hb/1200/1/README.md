# HB 1200 - DD parental caregivers

## Section 1
The legislature finds that Washington has promised to fund home and community-based supports to help children with developmental disabilities grow up as fully included members of their families and communities. The legislature also finds that personal care hours have been allocated to these children on the basis of need, but have historically only been budgeted based on utilization. Efforts to increase the in-home care workforce to meet demand have never produced full employment, and 41 percent of authorized hours systemwide go unused.

The legislature further finds that the unique needs of children to have stable and familiar caregivers are complicated by the current caregiver workforce shortage. Additionally, while the child care crisis has widespread effects on Washington families, it is particularly acute for families of children with disabilities, who often cannot find the highly trained providers to meet their child's needs. Nationwide research has shown that families of children with disabilities often have to forgo income opportunities due to these care needs and that a lack of income has lasting impacts on those children.

The legislature further finds that long term in-home care services are a less costly alternative to institutional care, saving taxpayers significant amounts. Many other states have demonstrated the positive effects of employing parents as caregivers after being authorized to do so during the COVID-19 public health emergency. In these states, paid family caregiving leads to better outcomes for medically fragile children and lower costs to taxpayers in the form of fewer hospitalizations. Washington currently allows employment of parent caregivers for their adult children assuring their access to home and community-based services and avoiding more costly forms of care like institutionalization.

The legislature further finds that the centers for medicare and medicaid services has recently updated its guidance to instruct states to strongly consider allowing legally responsible individuals, such as parents, to be paid for their caregiving in order to meet the requirement placed on all states to provide for the delivery of needed services.

Therefore, the legislature intends to support children with developmental disabilities and their family caregivers through legislative actions that promote fair labor practices, equitable compensation, and comprehensive support systems.
