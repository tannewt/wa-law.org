<ol>
<li>
<p>When vacating a conviction under this section, the court effectuates the vacation by: (a)(i) Permitting the applicant to withdraw the applicant's plea of guilty and to enter a plea of not guilty; or (ii) if the applicant has been convicted after a plea of not guilty, the court setting aside the verdict of guilty; and (b) the court dismissing the information, indictment, complaint, or citation against the applicant and vacating the judgment and sentence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every person convicted of a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor offense may apply to the sentencing court for a vacation of the applicant's record of conviction for the offense. If the court finds the applicant meets the requirements of this subsection, the court may in its discretion vacate the record of conviction. Except as provided in subsections (3), (4), (5), and (6) of this section, an applicant may not have the record of conviction for a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor offense vacated if any one of the following is present:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The applicant has two or more domestic violence convictions stemming from different incidents. For purposes of this subsection, however, if the current application is for more than one conviction that arose out of a single incident, none of those convictions counts as a previous conviction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The applicant has signed an affidavit under penalty of perjury affirming that the applicant has not previously had a conviction for a domestic violence offense, and a criminal history check reveals that the applicant has had such a conviction; or</p>

<p>Less than three years have passed since the applicant's release from supervision or probation for a conviction of RCW 46.61.502 or 46.61.504, or an offense considered a &quot;prior offense&quot; under RCW 46.61.5055, or less than five years have passed since the applicant's sentencing date for a conviction of RCW 46.61.502 or 46.61.504, or an offense considered a &quot;prior offense&quot; under RCW 46.61.5055, whichever is later;</p>

When preparing or filing the petition, the prosecutor is not deemed to be providing legal advice or legal assistance on behalf of the victim, but is fulfilling an administrative function on behalf of the state in order to further their responsibility to seek to reform and improve the administration of criminal justice. A record of conviction vacated using the process in RCW 9.96.080 is subject to subsections (7) and (8) of this section.</p>

If the person is deceased, a member of the person's family or an official representative of the tribe of which the person was a member may apply to the court on behalf of the deceased person. Notwithstanding the requirements of RCW 9.94A.640, the court shall vacate the record of conviction if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The applicant is a member of a tribe that may exercise treaty Indian fishing rights at the location where the offense occurred; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state has been enjoined from taking enforcement action of the statute or rule to the extent that it interferes with a treaty Indian fishing right as determined under , 384 F. Supp. 312 (W.D. Wash. 1974), or , 302 F. Supp. 899 (D. Oregon 1969), and any posttrial orders of those courts, or any other state supreme court or federal court decision.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every person convicted of a misdemeanor cannabis offense, who was 21 years of age or older at the time of the offense, may apply to the sentencing court for a vacation of the applicant's record of conviction for the offense.

If an applicant qualifies under this subsection, the court shall vacate the record of conviction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a person convicted of violating RCW 69.50.4011(1) (b) or (c), 69.50.4013, 69.50.4014, or 69.41.030(2) (b) or (c) completes a substance use disorder program and files proof of completion with the court, or obtains an assessment from a recovery navigator program established under RCW 71.24.115, an arrest and jail alternative program established under RCW 36.28A.450, or a law enforcement assisted diversion program established under RCW 71.24.589, and has six months of substantial compliance with recommended treatment or services and progress toward recovery goals as reflected by a written status update, upon verification the court must vacate the conviction or convictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person who is a family member of a homicide victim may apply to the sentencing court on the behalf of the victim for vacation of the victim's record of conviction for prostitution under RCW 9A.88.030.

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Except as provided in (c) and (d) of this subsection, once the court vacates a record of conviction under this section, the person shall be released from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the offense and the fact that the person has been convicted of the offense shall not be included in the person's criminal history for purposes of determining a sentence in any subsequent conviction. For all purposes, including responding to questions on employment or housing applications, a person whose conviction has been vacated under this section may state that he or she has never been convicted of that crime. However, nothing in this section affects the requirements for restoring a right to possess a firearm under RCW 9.41.041. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, nothing in this section affects or prevents the use of an offender's prior conviction in a later criminal prosecution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a court vacates a record of domestic violence as defined in RCW 10.99.020 under this section, the state may not use the vacated conviction in a later criminal prosecution unless the conviction was for: (i) Violating the provisions of a restraining order, no-contact order, or protection order restraining or enjoining the person or restraining the person from going on to the grounds of or entering a residence, workplace, school, or day care, or prohibiting the person from knowingly coming within, or knowingly remaining within, a specified distance of a location, a protected party's person, or a protected party's vehicle (RCW 10.99.040, 10.99.050, 26.09.300, 26.26B.050, 26.44.063, 26.44.150, or 26.52.070, or any of the former RCW 26.50.060, 26.50.070, 26.50.130, and 74.34.145); (ii) stalking (RCW 9A.46.110); or (iii) a domestic violence protection order or vulnerable adult protection order entered under chapter 7.105 RCW. A vacated conviction under this section is not considered a conviction of such an offense for the purposes of 27 C.F.R. 478.11.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A conviction vacated on or after July 28, 2019, qualifies as a prior conviction for the purpose of charging a present recidivist offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030 occurring on or after July 28, 2019.</p>

<p>When a court vacates a record of conviction specified under subsection (2)(g) of this section, the vacated conviction qualifies as a &quot;prior offense&quot; under RCW 46.61.502(6), 46.61.504(6), and 46.61.5055 in a later criminal prosecution of RCW 46.61.502 (driving while under the influence) or RCW 46.61.504 (actual physical control while under the influence) if the later prosecution is within 15 years of the date of the conviction for the vacated conviction. If a subsequent conviction of RCW 46.61.502 or 46.61.504 is within 15 years of the date of the conviction for the vacated conviction, the court may use the vacated conviction in determining a sentence or determining whether the subsequent conviction qualifies as a felony under RCW 46.61.5055.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A vacated conviction of RCW 46.61.502, 46.61.504, or an offense considered a &quot;prior offense&quot; under RCW 46.61.5055 pursuant to this section qualifies as a prior conviction in determining a sentence for a conviction under RCW 46.61.520 if the vehicular homicide occurred while the driver was under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of licensing may consider a vacated conviction of RCW 46.61.502, 46.61.504, or an offense considered a &quot;prior offense&quot; under RCW 46.61.5055 when determining a future administrative requirement for a subsequent conviction of RCW 46.61.502, 46.61.504, or an offense considered a &quot;prior offense&quot; under RCW 46.61.5055.</p>
