[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1154.pdf)

## Section 1
1. Applications for permits to operate a new or modified solid waste handling facility shall be on forms prescribed by the department and shall contain a description of the proposed facilities and operations at the site, plans and specifications for any new or additional facilities to be constructed, and such other information as the jurisdictional health department may deem necessary in order to determine whether the site and solid waste disposal facilities located thereon will comply with local regulations and state rules.

2. Upon receipt of an application for a permit to establish or modify a solid waste handling facility, the jurisdictional health department shall refer one copy of the application to the department which shall report its findings to the jurisdictional health department. When the application is for a permit to establish or modify a solid waste handling facility located in an area that is not under a quarantine, as defined in RCW 17.24.007, and when the facility will receive material for composting from an area under a quarantine, the jurisdictional health department shall also provide a copy of the application to the department of agriculture. The department of agriculture shall review the application to determine whether it contains information demonstrating that the proposed facility presents a risk of spreading disease, plant pathogens, or pests to areas that are not under a quarantine. For the purposes of this subsection, "composting" means the biological degradation and transformation of organic solid waste under controlled conditions designed to promote aerobic decomposition.

3. The jurisdictional health department shall investigate every application as may be necessary to determine whether a proposed or modified site and facilities meet all solid waste, air, and other applicable laws and regulations, and conforms with the approved comprehensive solid waste handling plan, and complies with all zoning requirements.

4. When the jurisdictional health department finds that the permit should be issued, and the department has approved the permit under RCW 70A.205.130, the jurisdictional health department shall issue such permit. Every application shall be approved or disapproved within 90 days after its receipt by the jurisdictional health department.

5. The jurisdictional board of health may establish reasonable fees for permits and renewal of permits. All permit fees collected by the health department shall be deposited in the treasury and to the account from which the health department's operating expenses are paid.

## Section 2
1. Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, every permit issued by a jurisdictional health department under RCW 70A.205.125 shall be reviewed by the department to ensure that the proposed site or facility conforms with:

    a. All applicable laws and regulations including the minimum functional standards for solid waste handling; and

    b. The approved comprehensive solid waste management plan.

2. The department shall review the permit within 30 days after the issuance of the permit by the jurisdictional health department. For solid waste handling facilities other than landfills, the department may appeal the issuance of the permit by the jurisdictional health department to the pollution control hearings board, as described in chapter 43.21B RCW, for noncompliance with subsection (1) (a) or (b) of this section.

        i. All applicable laws and regulations including the minimum functional standards for solid waste handling; and

        ii. The approved comprehensive solid waste management plan.

    b. The department shall review the permit prior to the issuance of the permit by the jurisdictional health department. The department may only approve a permit that ensures that the landfill conforms with all applicable laws and regulations, including the minimum functional standards for solid waste handling. The department may require a jurisdictional health department to amend the contents of a proposed permit to ensure conformance with applicable laws and regulations, including the minimum functional standards for solid waste handling.

## Section 3
1. Every permit for an existing solid waste handling facility issued pursuant to RCW 70A.205.125 shall be renewed at least every five years on a date established by the jurisdictional health department having jurisdiction of the site and as specified in the permit. If a permit is to be renewed for longer than one year, the local jurisdictional health department may hold a public hearing before making such a decision. Prior to renewing a permit, the health department shall conduct a review as it deems necessary to assure that the solid waste handling facility or facilities located on the site continues to meet minimum functional standards of the department, applicable local regulations, and are not in conflict with the approved solid waste management plan. A jurisdictional health department shall approve or disapprove a permit renewal within 45 days of conducting its review. The department shall review and may appeal the renewal of permits for solid waste handling facilities other than landfills as set forth for the approval of permits in RCW 70A.205.130(2). The department must review and approve or disapprove renewal of permits for landfill disposal facilities as set forth in RCW 70A.205.130(4).

2. The jurisdictional board of health may establish reasonable fees for permits reviewed under this section. All permit fees collected by the health department shall be deposited in the treasury and to the account from which the health department's operating expenses are paid.

        ii. The geographical boundaries of solid waste handling facilities at which the enforcement activities are planned.
