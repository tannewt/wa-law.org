<p>For health plans, including dental only and vision only plans, issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, any health carrier that requires any annual covered service to be provided at least 12 months following the previous service shall provide coverage for that service to allow an enrollee to obtain the covered service at least one month before 12 months have elapsed since the previous service was provided and apply the same cost-sharing requirements that would have been applied if the service occurred after 12 months had elapsed. For any covered service that a health carrier covers biennially or at another multiyear frequency, the health carrier shall provide coverage to allow an enrollee to obtain the covered service at least one month before that frequency has elapsed since the enrollee's previous covered service and apply the same cost-sharing requirements that would have been applied if the service occurred after the applicable period had elapsed.</p>
