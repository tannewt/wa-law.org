        i. Demonstrated prior national or in-state experience with a full continuum of behavioral health services that are substantially similar to the behavioral health services covered under the Washington medicaid state plan, including evidence through past and current data on performance, quality, and outcomes; and

7. The authority shall expand the types of behavioral health crisis services that can be funded with medicaid to the maximum extent allowable under federal law, including seeking approval from the centers for medicare and medicaid services for amendments to the medicaid state plan or medicaid state directed payments that support the 24 hours per day, 365 days per year capacity of the crisis delivery system when necessary to achieve this expansion.

8. The authority shall, in consultation with managed care organizations, review reports and recommendations of the involuntary treatment act work group established pursuant to section 103, chapter 302, Laws of 2020 and develop a plan for adding contract provisions that increase managed care organizations' accountability when their enrollees require long-term involuntary inpatient behavioral health treatment and shall explore opportunities to maximize medicaid funding as appropriate.

9. In recognition of the value of community input and consistent with past procurement practices, the authority shall include county and behavioral health provider representatives in the development of any medicaid integrated managed care procurement process. This shall include, at a minimum, two representatives identified by the association of county human services and two representatives identified by the Washington council for behavioral health to participate in the review and development of procurement documents.

10. For purposes of purchasing behavioral health services and medical care services for persons eligible for benefits under medicaid, Title XIX of the social security act and for persons not eligible for medicaid, the authority must use regional service areas. The regional service areas must be established by the authority as provided in RCW 74.09.870.

11. Consideration must be given to using multiple-biennia contracting periods.
