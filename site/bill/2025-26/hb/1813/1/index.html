<p>At least six months prior to releasing a medicaid integrated managed care procurement, but no later than January 1, 2025, the authority shall adopt statewide network adequacy standards that are assessed on a regional basis for the behavioral health provider networks maintained by managed care organizations pursuant to subsection (1)(d) of this section.

<li>
<p>Consider how the standards would impact requirements for behavioral health administrative service organizations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>The authority shall, in consultation with managed care organizations, review reports and recommendations of the involuntary treatment act work group established pursuant to section 103, chapter 302, Laws of 2020 and develop a plan for adding contract provisions that increase managed care organizations' accountability when their enrollees require long-term involuntary inpatient behavioral health treatment and shall explore opportunities to maximize medicaid funding as appropriate.</p>

<li>
<p>In recognition of the value of community input and consistent with past procurement practices, the authority shall include county and behavioral health provider representatives in the development of any medicaid integrated managed care procurement process. This shall include, at a minimum, two representatives identified by the association of county human services and two representatives identified by the Washington council for behavioral health to participate in the review and development of procurement documents.</p>
