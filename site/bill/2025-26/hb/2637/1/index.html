<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that any policy of state discrimination based on national origin, citizenship, or immigration status threatens the rights and proper privileges to Washington's residents and menaces the institutions and foundation of a free democratic state. The legislature further finds that there is a chilling effect and barrier to accessing state programs when personal information that would reveal information used to aid in civil immigration enforcement, other than the person's immigration or citizenship status as defined in RCW 43.17.420(7), is not protected from being used to target vulnerable populations. Immigration enforcement is not a primary function of any state agency. Personal information as identified in section 2 of this act that is submitted to the state for specific purposes is of no legitimate concern to the public and its disclosure would be highly offensive to a reasonable person if disclosure would reveal information that allows intrusion into the individual's private life. Furthermore, the legislature finds a substantial and compelling interest in ensuring that the state of Washington remains accessible for all residents to live and contribute by protecting the personal information shared in order to access state services that can be used to target Washington residents for immigration enforcement.</p>
