# HB 2305 - Clarifying that travel vans are not motor homes for purposes associated with vehicle registration.

## Section 1
The legislature finds that campers, travel trailers, and travel vans offer simplified amenities that are not the same as motor homes. People who own travel vans typically have other vehicles that have paid the motor vehicle excise tax to the regional transportation authority. Travel van usage does not typically result in more trips on the public transportation system. Therefore, the legislature declares that travel vans, like campers and travel trailers, are exempt from the motor vehicle excise tax.

## Section 2
"Travel van" means a vehicle with a body that fully encloses the driver and offers aspects of a temporary living area. The distance from the leading edge of the windshield to the foremost body section of vans is typically shorter than that of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. These vehicles are described by the manufacturer as a travel or camper van, not a motor home.

## Section 3
"Motor homes" means motor vehicles originally designed, reconstructed, or permanently altered to provide facilities for human habitation, which include lodging and cooking or sewage disposal, and is enclosed within a solid body shell with the vehicle, but excludes a camper or like unit constructed separately and affixed to a motor vehicle or a travel van as defined in section 2 of this act.
