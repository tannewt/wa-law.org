<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this act is to allow an electrical, gas, or water company, if authorized by an order issued by the utilities and transportation commission, to use securitization financing for certain types of costs related to emergency events and approved for recovery in rates. The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Securitized debt may lower the total rates in comparison with other methods of recovery and may benefit the citizens of this state who are electrical, gas, or water company customers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rate recovery bonds are not a public debt or pledge of the full faith and credit of the state but require the state to provide clear and exclusive methods to create, transfer, and encumber the rate recovery assets and prohibit future impairment; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This act allowing electrical, gas, or water companies to use securitization financing for emergency-related costs does not limit, impair, or affect the utilities and transportation commission's plenary authority and jurisdiction over rates and services offered by electrical, gas, or water companies.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>Energy or water conservation measures and services intended to improve the efficiency of electricity, gas, or water end use, including related carrying costs if:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The commission has approved inclusion of the expenditures in rate base and has not ordered that they be currently expensed; and</p>

    iii. Bonds, notes, certificates of beneficial interests in a trust, and other evidences of indebtedness or ownership issued pursuant to the approval are reasonably likely to receive a determination of, at a minimum, investment grade by credit rating agencies.
