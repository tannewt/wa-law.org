When a person turns 18, or is between the ages of 18 and 21, is in the care of the department subject to chapter 13.34 RCW, and is not already receiving supplemental security income and retirement, survivors, and disability insurance benefits, the department shall assess whether the person is eligible for such benefits.

When an individual between the ages of 18 and 21 serves as the representative payee, or when any person or entity other than the department is designated as the authorized representative for a youth in the department's care, the department does not owe a fiduciary duty to that individual, person, or entity with respect to those benefits.
