<p><a href="http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2611.pdf">Source</a></p>
<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes a 32-hour workweek offers substantial benefits for workers, particularly in supporting families that depend on dual incomes. With both parents often working full-time, reduced hours provide crucial flexibility for managing child care, household responsibilities, and family time without sacrificing financial stability. Beyond family support, employees experience significant improvements in their quality of life: Reduced stress levels, better mental and physical health, enhanced work-life balance, and greater overall well-being. These benefits translate into higher job satisfaction and engagement, creating a more fulfilled and motivated workforce that can bring renewed energy and focus to their work.</p>
<p>Further, the legislature finds there are equal benefits for employers. The transition to a shorter workweek does not mean reduced output. In fact, many companies have found that productivity either maintains its level or actually increases as workers become more focused and efficient with their time. This modernized approach to the standard workweek helps keep the state competitive in attracting and retaining top talent, particularly among younger workers who increasingly prioritize flexibility and well-being. The timing is particularly relevant given how advances in automation and artificial intelligence have dramatically increased what workers can accomplish in fewer hours; yet historically, the gains from these technological efficiencies have flowed primarily to company profits rather than being shared with workers through reduced hours or increased compensation. As artificial intelligence continues to accelerate productivity and reshape the workplace while also creating uncertainty about job displacement, a 32-hour workweek represents a forward-thinking way to share the benefits of technological progress with workers while simultaneously reducing turnover costs and fostering a more engaged, loyal workforce.</p>
