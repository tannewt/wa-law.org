# HB 2611 - 32 hour workweek

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2611.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature recognizes a 32-hour workweek offers substantial benefits for workers, particularly in supporting families that depend on dual incomes. With both parents often working full-time, reduced hours provide crucial flexibility for managing child care, household responsibilities, and family time without sacrificing financial stability. Beyond family support, employees experience significant improvements in their quality of life: Reduced stress levels, better mental and physical health, enhanced work-life balance, and greater overall well-being. These benefits translate into higher job satisfaction and engagement, creating a more fulfilled and motivated workforce that can bring renewed energy and focus to their work.

Further, the legislature finds there are equal benefits for employers. The transition to a shorter workweek does not mean reduced output. In fact, many companies have found that productivity either maintains its level or actually increases as workers become more focused and efficient with their time. This modernized approach to the standard workweek helps keep the state competitive in attracting and retaining top talent, particularly among younger workers who increasingly prioritize flexibility and well-being. The timing is particularly relevant given how advances in automation and artificial intelligence have dramatically increased what workers can accomplish in fewer hours; yet historically, the gains from these technological efficiencies have flowed primarily to company profits rather than being shared with workers through reduced hours or increased compensation. As artificial intelligence continues to accelerate productivity and reshape the workplace while also creating uncertainty about job displacement, a 32-hour workweek represents a forward-thinking way to share the benefits of technological progress with workers while simultaneously reducing turnover costs and fostering a more engaged, loyal workforce.

## Section 2
1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no employer shall employ any of his or her employees for a workweek longer than 32 hours unless such employee receives compensation for his or her employment in excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he or she is employed.

2. This section does not apply to:

    a. Any person exempted pursuant to RCW 49.46.010(4). The payment of compensation or provision of compensatory time off in addition to a salary shall not be a factor in determining whether a person is exempted under RCW 49.46.010(4)(c);

    b. Employees who request compensating time off in lieu of overtime pay;

    c. Any individual employed as a seaman whether or not the seaman is employed on a vessel other than an American vessel;

    e. Any individual employed as a motion picture projectionist if that employee is covered by a contract or collective bargaining agreement which regulates hours of work and overtime pay;

    f. An individual employed as a truck or bus driver who is subject to the provisions of the Federal Motor Carrier Act (49 U.S.C. Sec. 3101 et seq. and 49 U.S.C. Sec. 10101 et seq.), if the compensation system under which the truck or bus driver is paid includes overtime pay, reasonably equivalent to that required by this subsection, for working longer than forty hours per week;

    g. Any individual employed as an agricultural employee. This exemption from subsection (1) of this section applies only until December 31, 2021;

    h. Any industry in which federal law provides for an overtime payment based on a workweek other than forty hours. However, the provisions of the federal law regarding overtime payment based on a workweek other than forty hours shall nevertheless apply to employees covered by this section without regard to the existence of actual federal jurisdiction over the industrial activity of the particular employer within this state. For the purposes of this subsection, "industry" means a trade, business, industry, or other activity, or branch, or group thereof, in which individuals are gainfully employed (section 3(h) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended (Public Law 93-259));

Sec. 181 et seq.), when such hours are voluntarily worked by the employee pursuant to a shift-trading practice under which the employee has the opportunity in the same or in other workweeks to reduce hours worked by voluntarily offering a shift for trade or reassignment; and

    j. Any individual licensed under chapter 18.85 RCW unless the individual is providing real estate brokerage services under a written contract with a real estate firm which provides that the individual is an employee. For purposes of this subsection (2)(j), "real estate brokerage services" and "real estate firm" mean the same as defined in RCW 18.85.011.

3. No employer shall be deemed to have violated subsection (1) of this section by employing any employee of a retail or service establishment for a workweek in excess of the applicable workweek specified in subsection (1) of this section if:

    a. The regular rate of pay of the employee is in excess of one and one-half times the minimum hourly rate required under RCW 49.46.020; and

    b. More than half of the employee's compensation for a representative period, of not less than one month, represents commissions on goods or services.

In determining the proportion of compensation representing commissions, all earnings resulting from the application of a bona fide commission rate is to be deemed commissions on goods or services without regard to whether the computed commissions exceed the draw or guarantee.

4. No employer of commissioned salespeople primarily engaged in the business of selling automobiles, trucks, recreational vessels, recreational vessel trailers, recreational vehicle trailers, recreational campers, manufactured housing, or farm implements to ultimate purchasers shall violate subsection (1) of this section with respect to such commissioned salespeople if the commissioned salespeople are paid the greater of:

    a. Compensation at the hourly rate, which may not be less than the rate required under RCW 49.46.020, for each hour worked up to 32 hours per week, and compensation of one and one-half times that hourly rate for all hours worked over 32 hours in one week; or

    b. A straight commission, a salary plus commission, or a salary plus bonus applied to gross salary.

5. No public agency shall be deemed to have violated subsection (1) of this section with respect to the employment of any employee in fire protection activities or any employee in law enforcement activities (including security personnel in correctional institutions) if: (a) In a work period of 28 consecutive days the employee receives for tours of duty which in the aggregate exceed 240 hours; or (b) in the case of such an employee to whom a work period of at least seven but less than 28 days applies, in his or her work period the employee receives for tours of duty which in the aggregate exceed a number of hours which bears the same ratio to the number of consecutive days in his or her work period as 240 hours bears to 28 days; compensation at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he or she is employed.

6.

Any agricultural employee shall not be employed for more than 32 hours in any one workweek unless the agricultural employee receives one and one-half times that agricultural employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked over 32 in any one workweek.

7. [Empty]

    a. No damages, statutory or civil penalties, attorneys' fees and costs, or other type of relief may be granted against an employer to an agricultural or dairy employee seeking unpaid overtime due to the employee's historical exclusion from overtime under subsection (2)(g) of this section, as it existed on November 4, 2020.

    b. This subsection applies to all claims, causes of actions, and proceedings commenced on or after November 5, 2020, regardless of when the claim or cause of action arose. To this extent, this subsection applies retroactively, but in all other respects it applies prospectively.
