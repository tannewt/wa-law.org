## Section 1
1. The purpose of this compact is to facilitate the interstate practice of respiratory therapy with the goal of improving public access to respiratory therapy services by providing respiratory therapists licensed in a member state the ability to practice in other member states. The compact preserves the regulatory authority of states to protect public health and safety through the current system of state licensure.

    a. Increase public access to respiratory therapy services by creating a responsible, streamlined pathway for licensees to practice in member states with the goal of improving outcomes for patients;

    b. Enhance states' ability to protect the public's health and safety;

    c. Promote the cooperation of member states in regulating the practice of respiratory therapy within those member states;

    d. Ease administrative burdens on states by encouraging the cooperation of member states in regulating multistate respiratory therapy practice;

    e. Support relocating active military members and their spouses; and

    f. Promote mobility and address workforce shortages.

3. "Alternative program" means a nondisciplinary monitoring or practice remediation process applicable to a respiratory therapist approved by any state authority with regulatory authority over respiratory therapists.

Where expressly authorized or permitted by federal law, whether such federal law is in effect prior to, at, or after the time of a member state's enactment of this compact, a member state's enactment of this compact shall hereby authorize the member state's respiratory therapy licensing authority to perform criminal background checks as defined herein. The absence of such a federal law as described in this subsection shall not prevent or preclude such authorization where it may be derived or granted through means other than the enactment of this compact.

3. Nothing in this compact prohibits a member state from charging a fee for granting and renewing the compact privilege.

## Section 4
1. To exercise the compact privilege under the terms and provisions of the compact, the licensee shall:

    a. Hold and maintain an active home state license as a respiratory therapist;

    b. Hold and maintain an active credential from the national board for respiratory care (or its successor) that would qualify them for licensure in the remote state in which they are seeking the privilege;

    c. Have not had any adverse action against a license within the previous two years;

    d. Notify the commission that the licensee is seeking the compact privilege within a remote state(s);

    e. Pay any applicable fees, including any state and commission fees and renewal fees, for the compact privilege;

    f. Meet any jurisprudence requirements established by the remote state in which the licensee is seeking a compact privilege;

    g. Report to the commission adverse action taken by any nonmember state within 30 days from the date the adverse action is taken;

    h. Report to the commission, when applying for a compact privilege, the address of the licensee's domicile and thereafter promptly report to the commission any change in the address of the licensee's domicile within 30 days of the effective date of the change in address; and

Consent to accept service of process by mail at the licensee's domicile on record with the commission with respect to any action brought against the licensee by the commission or a member state, and consent to accept service of a subpoena by mail at the licensee's domicile on record with the commission with respect to any action brought or investigation conducted by the commission or a member state.

2. The compact privilege is valid until the expiration date or revocation of the home state license unless terminated pursuant to adverse action. The licensee must comply with all of the requirements of subsection (1) of this section to maintain the compact privilege in a remote state. If those requirements are met, no adverse actions are taken, and the licensee has paid any applicable compact privilege renewal fees, then the licensee will maintain the licensee's compact privilege.

3. A licensee providing respiratory therapy in a remote state under the compact privilege shall function within the scope of practice authorized by the remote state for the type of respiratory therapist license the licensee holds. Such procedures, actions, processes, and the circumstances under which they may be undertaken may be established through means including, but not limited to, statute, regulations, case law, and other processes available to the state respiratory therapy licensing authority or other government agency.

4. If a licensee's compact privilege in a remote state is removed by the remote state, the individual shall lose or be ineligible for the compact privilege in that remote state until the compact privilege is no longer limited or restricted by that state.

5. If a home state license is encumbered, the licensee shall lose the compact privilege in all remote states until the following occur:

    a. The home state license is no longer encumbered; and

    b. Two years have elapsed from the date on which the license is no longer encumbered due to the adverse action.

6. Once a licensee with a restricted or limited license meets the requirements of subsection (5)(a) and (b) of this section, the licensee must also meet the requirements of subsection (1) of this section to obtain a compact privilege in a remote state.

## Section 5
1. An active military member, or their spouse, shall designate a home state where the individual has a current license in good standing. The individual may retain the home state designation during the period the service member is on active duty.

2. An active military member and their spouse shall not be required to pay to the commission for a compact privilege any fee that may otherwise be charged by the commission. If a remote state chooses to charge a fee for a compact privilege, it may choose to charge a reduced fee or no fee to an active military member and their spouse for a compact privilege.

## Section 6
1. A member state in which a licensee is licensed shall have authority to impose adverse action against the license issued by that member state.

2. A member state may take adverse action based on significant investigative information of a remote state or the home state, so long as the member state follows its own procedures for imposing adverse action.

3. Nothing in this compact shall override a member state's decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action and that such participation shall remain nonpublic if required by the member state's laws.

        iii. Unless otherwise prohibited by state law, recover from the licensee the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that licensee.

    b. Notwithstanding (a)(ii) of this subsection, a member state may not issue a subpoena to gather evidence of conduct in another member state that is lawful in such other member state for the purpose of taking adverse action against a licensee's compact privilege or application for a compact privilege in that member state.

    c. Nothing in this compact authorizes a member state to impose discipline against a respiratory therapist's compact privilege in that member state for the individual's otherwise lawful practice in another state.

5. Joint investigations.

    a. In addition to the authority granted to a member state by its respective respiratory therapy practice act or other applicable state law, a member state may participate with other member states in joint investigations of licensees, provided, however, that a member state receiving such a request has no obligation to respond to any subpoena issued regarding an investigation of conduct or practice that was lawful in a member state at the time it was undertaken.

    b. Member states shall share any significant investigative information, litigation, or compliance materials in furtherance of any joint or individual investigation initiated under the compact. In sharing such information between member state respiratory therapy licensing authorities, all information obtained shall be kept confidential, except as otherwise mutually agreed upon by the sharing and receiving member state(s).

## Section 9
1. The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the compact.

4. If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule or portion of a rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact within four years of the date of adoption of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any member state.

5. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission.

6. Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.

    b. To persons who have requested notice of the commission's notices of proposed rule making; and

    c. In such other way(s) as the commission may by rule specify.

8. The notice of proposed rule making shall include:

    e. The manner in which interested persons may submit written comments.

9. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all written comments and documents received by the commission in response to the proposed rule shall be available to the public.

10. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this section.

11. The commission shall, by majority vote of all commissioners, take final action on the proposed rule based on the rule-making record and the full text of the rule.

    a. The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes are consistent with the original purpose of the proposed rule.

    b. The commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters.

    c. The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection (12) of this section, the effective date of the rule shall be no sooner than 30 days after issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the rule.

12. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule with 24 hours' notice, and with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rule-making procedures provided in the compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:

    a. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;

    b. Prevent a loss of commission or member state funds;

    c. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is established by federal law or rule; or

    d. Protect public health and safety.

13. The commission or an authorized committee of the commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission.

14. [Empty]

    a. No member state's rule-making process or procedural requirements shall apply to the commission.

    b. The commission shall have no authority over any member state's rule-making process or procedural requirements that do not pertain to the compact.

15. Nothing in this compact, nor any rule or regulation of the commission, shall be construed to limit, restrict, or in any way reduce the ability of a member state to enact and enforce laws, regulations, or other rules related to the practice of respiratory therapy in that state, where those laws, regulations, or other rules are not inconsistent with the provisions of this compact.

## Section 10
1. Oversight.

    a. The executive and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the compact.

    b. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.

    c. The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.

2. Default, technical assistance, and termination.

    a. If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that the commission may take, and shall offer training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.

    b. The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other member states.

3. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the commissioners of the member states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.

4. Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, the defaulting state's respiratory therapy licensing authority, and each of the member states' respiratory therapy licensing authorities.

5. A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination, if necessary.

6. Upon the termination of a state's membership from this compact, that state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees and compact privilege holders (of which the commission has a record) within that state of such termination. The terminated state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of said notice of termination.

7. The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state.

8. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees.

9. Dispute resolution.

    a. Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among member states and between member and nonmember states.

    b. The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as appropriate.

10. Enforcement.

    a. By majority vote, as may be further provided by rule, the commission may initiate legal action against a member state in default in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. A member state by enactment of this compact consents to venue and jurisdiction in such court for the purposes set forth herein. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting member state's law.

    b. A member state may initiate legal action against the commission in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees.

    c. No person other than a member state shall enforce this compact against the commission.

## Section 11
1. The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh member state ("effective date").

    a. On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the first seven member states ("charter member states") to determine if the statute enacted by each such charter member state is materially different than the model compact.

        i. A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model compact shall be entitled to the default process set forth in section 10 of this act.

        ii. If any member state is later found to be in default, or is terminated or withdraws from the compact, the commission shall remain in existence and the compact shall remain in effect even if the number of member states should be less than seven.

    b. Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven initial charter member states shall be subject to the process set forth herein and commission rule to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model compact and whether they qualify for participation in the compact.

    c. All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the commission unless specifically repudiated by the commission. The commission shall own and have all rights to any intellectual property developed on behalf or in furtherance of the commission by individuals or entities involved in organizing or establishing the commission, as may be further set forth in rules of the commission.

    d. Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the commission's initial adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be subject to the rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the date the compact becomes law in that state.

2. Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.

    a. A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until 180 days after enactment of the repealing statute.

    b. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state's respiratory therapy licensing authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.

    c. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees and compact privilege holders (of which the commission has a record) within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.

3. Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact.

4. This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.

## Section 12
1. This compact and the commission's rule-making authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to limit the commission's rule-making authority solely for those purposes.

2. The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.

3. Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, the commission may deny a state's participation in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of section 10 of this act, terminate a member state's participation in the compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state is a material departure from the compact.  Otherwise, if this compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable matters.

## Section 13
1. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a member state that is not inconsistent with the compact.

2. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a member state in conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict, including any subsequently enacted state laws.

3. All permissible agreements between the commission and the member states are binding in accordance with their terms.

4. Other than as expressly set forth herein, nothing in this compact will impact initial licensure.
