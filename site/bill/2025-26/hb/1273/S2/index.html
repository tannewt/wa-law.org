<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that students who participate in dual credit programs have higher rates of college enrollment, persistence, and completion. Dual credit programs are an important economic development for Washington because they equip students with the skills needed for high-skill, high-wage employment and continued education in high-demand sectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Career and technical education (CTE) dual credit is the most commonly accessed form of dual credit in Washington and has significant potential to improve equitable access to postsecondary pathways for students from all backgrounds. However, it lags behind other course-based dual credit programs in ensuring that students receive a transcripted credit while in high school, and that the credit they earn will transfer to the postsecondary institution of their choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to extend and expand a pilot program for the purpose of increasing CTE dual credit participation and credential attainment in professional technical programs and receive recommendations on future amendments to state dual credit policies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>

<li>
<p>The pilot program must be a continuation of the pilot program established in section 601(47)(a), chapter 376, Laws of 2024. This pilot program may receive grant funding for up to two years.</p>
