<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that students who participate in dual credit programs have higher rates of college enrollment, persistence, and completion. Dual credit programs are an important economic development for Washington because they equip students with the skills needed for high-skill, high-wage employment and continued education in high-demand sectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Career and technical education (CTE) dual credit is the most commonly accessed form of dual credit in Washington and has significant potential to improve equitable access to postsecondary pathways for students from all backgrounds. However, it lags behind other course-based dual credit programs in ensuring that students receive a transcripted credit while in high school, and that the credit they earn will transfer to the postsecondary institution of their choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to streamline regional efforts that support students' dual credit access and attainment by increasing the collaboration between state and local partners, study the feasibility of improving the state's dual credit administrative data management system, create and encourage the use of statewide articulation agreements for CTE dual credit courses, and receive recommendations on future amendments to state dual credit policies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Each educational service district shall collaborate with the following entities to streamline regional efforts that support students' dual credit access and attainment: The office of the superintendent of public instruction, the state board for community and technical colleges, regional participating institutions of higher education, regional skill centers established under chapter 28A.245 RCW, regional registered apprenticeship programs approved under chapter 49.04 RCW, local public high schools, and each school district operating within the educational service district.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the regional efforts required by subsection (1) of this section must include the following activities:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Developing, and updating annually, a comprehensive catalog of dual credit courses and programs offered to students enrolled in each local public high school;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aligning career and technical education dual credit programs available within the educational service district with regional postsecondary credential pathways and apprenticeships leading to in-demand career fields;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing technical assistance to public high schools and institutions of higher education to improve the accuracy and speed of awarding and transcripting dual credits;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing professional development for staff of the public high schools and the institutions of higher education to develop, align, and articulate dual credit courses; and</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>Outreach to prospective students and students who have completed career and technical education dual credit courses and are eligible for postsecondary credit about how to receive and where to apply the credit;</p>
