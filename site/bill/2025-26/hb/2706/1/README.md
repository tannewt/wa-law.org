# HB 2706 - DSHS tort claims

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2706.pdf)

## Section 1
1. It is the intent of the legislature to establish a claims commission within the office of administrative hearings to address ballooning payments from the liability account, also known as the self-insurance liability account. The liability account is used to pay tort claims, judgments, and settlements arising from general liability when the state is found to be wholly or partially negligent. The legislature finds that there has been a steep increase in the number and payouts of tort claims in recent years following legislative changes and court rulings. As a result, the liability account has been in a continuous and growing cash deficit position.

2. The legislature finds that liability for the department of children, youth, and families has increased exponentially, primarily due to historical childhood abuse claims. In 2019, the state supreme court decided H.B.H. v. State, 192 Wn.2d 154, which defined the state's liability for childhood abuse claims. In fiscal year 2019, the year of the ruling, 157 claims were filed against the department of children, youth, and families. In fiscal year 2025, 1,455 claims were filed against the department of children, youth, and families, an increase of over 800 percent. Agency insurance premiums have not been raised quickly enough to capture this dramatic increase in cases. The liability account, the account used to pay the awards in these cases, is facing a $1,300,000,000 to $1,400,000,000 shortfall this fiscal biennium.

3. The legislature intends to amend this deficit by creating a claims commission designed to adjudicate historical claims against the department of children, youth, and families, which would create significant cost avoidance in the current fiscal biennium.

## Section 2
1. There is hereby created a claims commission within the office of administrative hearings. The commission has jurisdiction to adjudicate claims against the state, or against the state's officers, employees, or volunteers, acting in such capacity, for damages arising out of tortious conduct that occurred prior to 2020 and that is alleged against the department of children, youth, and families, and the department's officers, employees, and volunteers.

2. The state shall have sovereign immunity from all tort claims within the jurisdiction of the claims commission. Such claims must be brought to the claims commission for resolution.

3. [Empty]

    a. The claims commission shall receive and accept claims only upon compliance with all of the requirements in RCW 4.92.100. The office of risk management shall certify to the commission that all requirements have been met and shall provide all relevant documentation to the commission.

    b. [Empty]

        i. The claims commission shall consist of an administrative law judge appointed under RCW 34.12.030(1), a medical or mental health professional with expertise in trauma, an attorney with experience representing plaintiffs with tort claims against the state as nominated by the Washington association for justice, a representative of the department of enterprise services, a representative of the defendant agency, a representative of the attorney general, and a representative of the office of financial management. Members of the commission shall be appointed by the governor.

        ii. The administrative law judge member of the claims commission shall serve as chair of the commission.

4. [Empty]

    a. After acceptance of a case by the claims commission, a party may conduct discovery as follows:

        i. Request from the chair of the commission an examination under CR 35;

        ii. Request admissions from a party under CR 36; and

        iii. Take the deposition of another party.

    b. A party may request additional discovery from the chair of the commission, including interrogatories, and the chair will allow additional discovery only as reasonably necessary.

5. A claimant who accepts the claim commission's award for damages may not seek review under subsection (6) of this section or file a court action on his or her claim.

6. An aggrieved party that is unsatisfied with a final decision of the claims commission may file for a trial de novo in superior court pursuant to chapter 7.06 RCW.

7. Before filing a claim with the claims commission, a claimant shall comply with the presentment and filing requirements outlined in RCW 4.92.100 and 4.92.110.

## Section 3
1. Following a hearing as prescribed by court rule or following a determination by the claims commission established in section 2 of this act, the arbitrator or chair of the commission shall file his or her decision and award with the clerk of the superior court, together with proof of service thereof on the parties. Within 20 days after such filing, any aggrieved party may file with the clerk a written notice of appeal and request for a trial de novo in the superior court on all issues of law and fact. The notice must be signed by the party. Such trial de novo shall thereupon be held, including a right to jury, if demanded.

    a. Up to 30 days prior to the actual date of a trial de novo, a nonappealing party may serve upon the appealing party a written offer of compromise.

    b. In any case in which an offer of compromise is not accepted by the appealing party within 10 calendar days after service thereof, for purposes of MAR 7.3, the amount of the offer of compromise shall replace the amount of the arbitrator's award for determining whether the party appealing the arbitrator's award has failed to improve that party's position on the trial de novo.

    c. A postarbitration offer of compromise shall not be filed or communicated to the court or the trier of fact until after judgment on the trial de novo, at which time a copy of the offer of compromise shall be filed for purposes of determining whether the party who appealed the arbitrator's award has failed to improve that party's position on the trial de novo, pursuant to MAR 7.3.

2. If no appeal has been filed at the expiration of 20 days following filing of the arbitrator's or chair of the commission's decision and award, a judgment shall be entered and may be presented to the court by any party, on notice, which judgment when entered shall have the same force and effect as judgments in civil actions.

## Section 4
1. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, in the discretion of the agency head, the presiding officer in an administrative hearing shall be:

    a. The agency head or one or more members of the agency head;

    c. One or more administrative law judges assigned by the office of administrative hearings in accordance with chapter 34.12 RCW; or

    d. A person or persons designated by the secretary of health pursuant to RCW 43.70.740.

4. Any party may petition for the disqualification of an individual promptly after receipt of notice indicating that the individual will preside or, if later, promptly upon discovering facts establishing grounds for disqualification.

5. The individual whose disqualification is requested shall determine whether to grant the petition, stating facts and reasons for the determination.

6. When the presiding officer is an administrative law judge, the provisions of this section regarding disqualification for cause are in addition to the motion of prejudice available under RCW 34.12.050.

7. If a substitute is required for an individual who becomes unavailable as a result of disqualification or any other reason, the substitute must be appointed by the appropriate appointing authority.

8. Any action taken by a duly appointed substitute for an unavailable individual is as effective as if taken by the unavailable individual.

## Section 5
Except pursuant to RCW 43.70.740 and section 2 of this act, whenever a state agency conducts a hearing which is not presided over by officials of the agency who are to render the final decision, the hearing shall be conducted by an administrative law judge assigned under this chapter. In assigning administrative law judges, the chief administrative law judge shall wherever practical (1) use personnel having expertise in the field or subject matter of the hearing, and (2) assign administrative law judges primarily to the hearings of particular agencies on a long-term basis.

## Section 6
1. No execution shall issue against the state on any judgment.

2. Whenever a final judgment against the state is obtained in an action on a claim arising out of tortious conduct, or whenever a final order awarding damages is obtained in an administrative proceeding under section 2 of this act, the claim shall be paid from the liability account.

3. Whenever a final judgment against the state shall have been obtained in any other action, the clerk of the court shall make and furnish to the office of risk management a duly certified copy of such judgment; the office of risk management shall thereupon audit the amount of damages and costs therein awarded, and the same shall be paid from appropriations specifically provided for such purposes by law.

4. Final judgments for which there are no provisions in state law for payment shall be transmitted by the office of risk management to the senate and house of representatives committees on ways and means as follows:

    b. During each session of legislature, the office of risk management shall transmit judgments immediately upon completion of audit.

5. All claims, other than judgments, made to the legislature against the state of Washington for money or property, shall be accompanied by a statement of the facts on which such claim is based and such evidence as the claimant intends to offer in support of the claim and shall be filed with the office of risk management, which shall retain the same as a record. All claims of two thousand dollars or less shall be approved or rejected by the office of risk management, and if approved shall be paid from appropriations specifically provided for such purpose by law. Such decision, if adverse to the claimant in whole or part, shall not preclude the claimant from seeking relief from the legislature. If the claimant accepts any part of his or her claim which is approved for payment by the office of risk management, such acceptance shall constitute a waiver and release of the state from any further claims relating to the damage or injury asserted in the claim so accepted. The office of risk management shall submit to the house and senate committees on ways and means, at the beginning of each regular session, a comprehensive list of all claims paid pursuant to this subsection during the preceding year. For all claims not approved by the office of risk management, the office of risk management shall recommend to the legislature whether such claims should be approved or rejected.

    d. A summary of equitable or public policy arguments which might be helpful in resolving the claim.

6. The legislative committees to whom such claims are referred shall make a transcript, recording, or statement of the substance of the evidence given in support of such a claim. If the legislature approves a claim the same shall be paid from appropriations specifically provided for such purpose by law.

7. Subsections (3) through (6) of this section do not apply to judgments or claims against the state housing finance commission created under chapter 43.180 RCW.

## Section 7

## Section 10
A liability account in the custody of the treasurer is hereby created as a nonappropriated account to be used solely and exclusively for the payment of liability settlements and judgments against the state under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981 et seq. or for the tortious conduct of its officers, employees, and volunteers and all related legal defense costs.

1.

If the account exceeds the maximum amount specified in this section, premiums may be adjusted by the office of risk management in order to maintain the account balance at the maximum limits. If, after adjustment of premiums, the account balance remains above the limits specified, the excess amount shall be prorated back to the appropriate funds.
