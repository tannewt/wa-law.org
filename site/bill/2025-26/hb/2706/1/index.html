<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to establish a claims commission within the office of administrative hearings to address ballooning payments from the liability account, also known as the self-insurance liability account. The liability account is used to pay tort claims, judgments, and settlements arising from general liability when the state is found to be wholly or partially negligent. The legislature finds that there has been a steep increase in the number and payouts of tort claims in recent years following legislative changes and court rulings. As a result, the liability account has been in a continuous and growing cash deficit position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that liability for the department of children, youth, and families has increased exponentially, primarily due to historical childhood abuse claims. In 2019, the state supreme court decided H.B.H. v. State, 192 Wn.2d 154, which defined the state's liability for childhood abuse claims. In fiscal year 2019, the year of the ruling, 157 claims were filed against the department of children, youth, and families. In fiscal year 2025, 1,455 claims were filed against the department of children, youth, and families, an increase of over 800 percent. Agency insurance premiums have not been raised quickly enough to capture this dramatic increase in cases. The liability account, the account used to pay the awards in these cases, is facing a $1,300,000,000 to $1,400,000,000 shortfall this fiscal biennium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to amend this deficit by creating a claims commission designed to adjudicate historical claims against the department of children, youth, and families, which would create significant cost avoidance in the current fiscal biennium.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There is hereby created a claims commission within the office of administrative hearings. The commission has jurisdiction to adjudicate claims against the state, or against the state's officers, employees, or volunteers, acting in such capacity, for damages arising out of tortious conduct that occurred prior to 2020 and that is alleged against the department of children, youth, and families, and the department's officers, employees, and volunteers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state shall have sovereign immunity from all tort claims within the jurisdiction of the claims commission. Such claims must be brought to the claims commission for resolution.</p>

<p>A party may request additional discovery from the chair of the commission, including interrogatories, and the chair will allow additional discovery only as reasonably necessary.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A claimant who accepts the claim commission's award for damages may not seek review under subsection (6) of this section or file a court action on his or her claim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An aggrieved party that is unsatisfied with a final decision of the claims commission may file for a trial de novo in superior court pursuant to chapter 7.06 RCW.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Following a hearing as prescribed by court rule or following a determination by the claims commission established in section 2 of this act, the arbitrator or chair of the commission shall file his or her decision and award with the clerk of the superior court, together with proof of service thereof on the parties. Within 20 days after such filing, any aggrieved party may file with the clerk a written notice of appeal and request for a trial de novo in the superior court on all issues of law and fact. The notice must be signed by the party. Such trial de novo shall thereupon be held, including a right to jury, if demanded.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Up to 30 days prior to the actual date of a trial de novo, a nonappealing party may serve upon the appealing party a written offer of compromise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In any case in which an offer of compromise is not accepted by the appealing party within 10 calendar days after service thereof, for purposes of MAR 7.3, the amount of the offer of compromise shall replace the amount of the arbitrator's award for determining whether the party appealing the arbitrator's award has failed to improve that party's position on the trial de novo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A postarbitration offer of compromise shall not be filed or communicated to the court or the trier of fact until after judgment on the trial de novo, at which time a copy of the offer of compromise shall be filed for purposes of determining whether the party who appealed the arbitrator's award has failed to improve that party's position on the trial de novo, pursuant to MAR 7.3.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If no appeal has been filed at the expiration of 20 days following filing of the arbitrator's or chair of the commission's decision and award, a judgment shall be entered and may be presented to the court by any party, on notice, which judgment when entered shall have the same force and effect as judgments in civil actions.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever a final judgment against the state shall have been obtained in any other action, the clerk of the court shall make and furnish to the office of risk management a duly certified copy of such judgment; the office of risk management shall thereupon audit the amount of damages and costs therein awarded, and the same shall be paid from appropriations specifically provided for such purposes by law.</p>

Such decision, if adverse to the claimant in whole or part, shall not preclude the claimant from seeking relief from the legislature.
