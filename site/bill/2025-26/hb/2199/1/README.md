[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2199.pdf)

## Section 1
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

## Section 2
1. Subject to the contest provisions of RCW 79.100.120, after taking custody of a vessel, the authorized public entity may use or dispose of the vessel in any appropriate and environmentally sound manner without further notice to any owners, but must give preference to uses that derive some monetary benefit from the vessel, either in whole or in scrap. If no value can be derived from the vessel, the authorized public entity must give preference to the least costly, environmentally sound, reasonable disposal option. Any disposal operations must be consistent with the state solid waste disposal provisions provided for in chapter 70A.205 RCW.

2. If the authorized public entity chooses to offer the vessel at a public auction, either a minimum bid may be set or a letter of credit may be required, or both, to discourage future reabandonment of the vessel.

3. Proceeds derived from the sale of the vessel must first be applied to any administrative costs that are incurred by the authorized public entity during the notification procedures set forth in RCW 79.100.040, removal and disposal costs, and costs associated with environmental damages directly or indirectly caused by the vessel. If the proceeds derived from the vessel exceed all administrative costs, removal and disposal costs, and costs associated with environmental damages directly or indirectly caused by the vessel, the remaining moneys must be applied to satisfying any liens registered against the vessel.

4. Any value derived from a vessel greater than all liens and costs incurred reverts to the derelict vessel removal account established in RCW 79.100.100.

## Section 3

An owner or lienholder seeking to contest an authorized public entity's decision to take temporary possession or custody of a vessel under this chapter, or to contest the amount of reimbursement owed to an authorized public entity under this chapter, may request a hearing in accordance with this section.

    b. A transferor or other entity with secondary liability under this chapter or RCW 88.26.030 may commence a lawsuit in the superior court for the county in which custody of the vessel was taken to contest the transferor's or other entity's liability or the amount of reimbursement owed the authorized public entity under this chapter.

    a. If the contested decision or action was undertaken by a state agency, a written request for a hearing related to the decision or action must be filed with the pollution control hearings board and served on the state agency in accordance with RCW 43.21B.230 (2) and (3) within 30 days of the date the authorized public entity secures or removes the vessel after acquiring custody  under RCW 79.100.040, or if the vessel is redeemed before the authorized public entity acquires custody, the date of redemption, or the right to a hearing is deemed waived and the vessel's owner is liable for any costs owed the authorized public entity. In the event of litigation, the prevailing party is entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.

    b. Upon receipt of a timely hearing request, the pollution control hearings board shall proceed to hear and determine the validity of the decision to take the vessel into temporary possession or custody and the reasonableness of any towing, storage, or other charges permitted under this chapter. Within five business days after the request for a hearing is filed, the pollution control hearings board shall notify the vessel owner requesting the hearing and the authorized public entity of the date, time, and location for the hearing. Unless the vessel is redeemed before the request for hearing is filed, the pollution control hearings board shall set the hearing on a date that is within 10 business days of the filing of the request for hearing. If the vessel is redeemed before the request for a hearing is filed, the pollution control hearings board shall set the hearing on a date that is within 60 days of the filing of the request for hearing.

    c. Consistent with RCW 43.21B.305, a proceeding brought under this subsection may be heard by one member of the pollution control hearings board, whose decision is the final decision of the board. An administrative law judge employed by the pollution control hearings board may be substituted for a board member under this section.

    a. If the contested decision or action was undertaken by a metropolitan park district, port district, city, town, or county, which has adopted rules or procedures for contesting decisions or actions pertaining to derelict or abandoned vessels, those rules or procedures must be followed in order to contest a decision to take temporary possession or custody of a vessel, or to contest the amount of reimbursement owed.

    b. If the metropolitan park district, port district, city, town, or county has not adopted rules or procedures for contesting decisions or actions pertaining to derelict or abandoned vessels, then an owner or lienholder requesting a hearing under this section must follow the procedure established in subsection (2) of this section.
