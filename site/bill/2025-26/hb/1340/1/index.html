c. [Empty]

    i. &quot;Prepared food&quot; means:
</code></pre>
<p>(A) Food sold in a heated state or heated by the seller;</p>
<p>(B) Food sold with eating utensils provided by the seller, including plates, knives, forks, spoons, glasses, cups, napkins, or straws. A plate does not include a container or packaging used to transport the food; or</p>
<p>(C) Two or more food ingredients mixed or combined by the seller for sale as a single item, except:</p>
<p>(I) Food that is only cut, repackaged, or pasteurized by the seller; or</p>
<p>(II) Raw eggs, fish, meat, poultry, and foods containing these raw animal foods requiring cooking by the consumer as recommended by the federal food and drug administration in chapter 3, part 401.11 of the food code, published by the food and drug administration, as amended or renumbered as of January 1, 2003, so as to prevent foodborne illness.</p>
<pre><code>    ii. Food is &quot;sold with eating utensils provided by the seller&quot; if:
</code></pre>
<p>(A) The seller's customary practice for that item is to physically deliver or hand a utensil to the customer with the food or food ingredient as part of the sales transaction. If the food or food ingredient is prepackaged with a utensil, the seller is considered to have physically delivered a utensil to the customer unless the food and utensil are prepackaged together by a food manufacturer classified under sector 311 of the North American industry classification system (NAICS);</p>
<p>(B) A plate, glass, cup, or bowl is necessary to receive the food or food ingredient, and the seller makes those utensils available to its customers; or</p>
<p>(C)(I) The seller makes utensils available to its customers, and the seller has more than 75 percent prepared food sales. For purposes of this subsection (2)(c)(ii)(C), a seller has more than 75 percent prepared food sales if the seller's gross retail sales of prepared food under (c)(i)(A), (c)(i)(C), and (c)(ii)(B) of this subsection equal more than 75 percent of the seller's gross retail sales of all food and food ingredients, including prepared food, soft drinks, and dietary supplements.</p>
<p>(II) However, even if a seller has more than 75 percent prepared food sales, four servings or more of food or food ingredients packaged for sale as a single item and sold for a single price are not &quot;sold with utensils provided by the seller&quot; unless the seller's customary practice for the package is to physically hand or otherwise deliver a utensil to the customer as part of the sales transaction. Whenever available, the number of servings included in a package of food or food ingredients must be determined based on the manufacturer's product label. If no label is available, the seller must reasonably determine the number of servings.</p>
<p>(III) The seller must determine a single prepared food sales percentage annually for all the seller's establishments in the state based on the prior year of sales. The seller may elect to determine its prepared food sales percentage based either on the prior calendar year or on the prior fiscal year. A seller may not change its elected method for determining its prepared food percentage without the written consent of the department. The seller must determine its annual prepared food sales percentage as soon as possible after accounting records are available, but in no event later than 90 days after the beginning of the seller's calendar or fiscal year. A seller may make a good faith estimate of its first annual prepared food sales percentage if the seller's records for the prior year are not sufficient to allow the seller to calculate the prepared food sales percentage. The seller must adjust its good faith estimate prospectively if its relative sales of prepared foods in the first 90 days of operation materially depart from the seller's estimate.</p>
<pre><code>    iii. &quot;Prepared food&quot;  includes the following items:
</code></pre>
<p>(A) Food sold by a seller whose proper primary NAICS classification is manufacturing in sector 311, except subsector 3118 (bakeries), as provided in the &quot;North American industry classification systemUnited States, 2002&quot;;</p>

<p>(C) Bakery items. The term &quot;bakery items&quot; includes bread, rolls, buns, biscuits, bagels, croissants, pastries, donuts, Danish, cakes, tortes, pies, tarts, muffins, bars, cookies, or tortillas.</p>
<pre><code>d. &quot;Soft drinks&quot; means nonalcoholic beverages that contain natural or artificial sweeteners. Soft drinks do not include beverages that contain: Milk or milk products; soy, rice, or similar milk substitutes; or greater than 50 percent of vegetable or fruit juice by volume.
