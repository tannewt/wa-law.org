<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes the significant benefits of dual enrollment programs like running start, which allow high school students to earn college and high school credit simultaneously. A 2024 research brief from the education research and data center highlights that students who participate in running start complete associate and bachelor's degrees faster and with fewer average credits compared to the statewide average and other dual credit programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature acknowledges that, while running start allows 11th and 12th graders the opportunity to attend in-person and online classes at community colleges and some universities without the burden of tuition costs, expenses such as textbooks, transportation, and class materials continue to create barriers to program participation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that it created the Washington dual enrollment scholarship pilot program in 2019 to remove financial barriers for running start students at 13 pilot sites. In accordance with the sunset act, the joint legislative audit and review committee reviewed the program and made the following recommendations: (a) The legislature should continue the dual enrollment scholarship; and (b) the program administrator, the Washington student achievement council, should provide consistent and documented guidance and technical assistance to pilot sites and improve its oversight. The legislature admits that the program ends in 2025 unless reauthorized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to: (a) Continue the dual enrollment scholarship program and make it available to all running start students; (b) direct the Washington student achievement council to both adopt rules to implement the program and to develop guidance and technical assistance for the program; and (c) expand the uses of the scholarship award.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that dual credit programs reduce both the cost and time of attendance to obtain a postsecondary degree. The legislature intends to reduce barriers and increase access to postsecondary educational opportunities for low-income students by removing the financial barriers for dual enrollment programs for students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office, in consultation with the participating institutions of higher education and the office of the superintendent of public instruction, shall establish and administer the Washington dual enrollment scholarship  program.</p>
</li>

</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>.

<pre><code>d. Professional technical program, preapprenticeship program, or apprenticeship program materials as determined appropriate by the college or university to pay for specific course-related material costs, which may include occupation-specific tools, work clothes, rain gear, or boots; and

e. If sufficient funding is available after the costs in (a) through (d) of this subsection are covered, a basic needs stipend for food and transportation. The amount of the stipend must be determined by the office, in consultation with the state board for community and technical colleges and participating four-year institutions of higher education. The participating institution of higher education must report to the office the basic needs category for which the stipend was used.

<p>To support scholarship utilization, cost and expense invoicing, and implementation of the rules, the office shall develop and periodically update guidance and other technical assistance, which must be made available to the participating institutions of higher education.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
