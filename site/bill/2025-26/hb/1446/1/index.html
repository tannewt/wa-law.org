<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<p>George Washington was born on February 22, 1732, in Virginia. By the time he reached the age of 16, he had completed several practice surveys and accompanied the surveyor of Prince William county on a month-long trip across the Blue Ridge mountains. In July 1749 at the young age of 17, George Washington was appointed as the county surveyor for the newly created frontier county of Culpeper. There are 199 professional surveys attributed to George Washington.</p>
<p>In late 1753, George Washington became involved in the French and Indian War when he was selected as the British emissary to the French frontier establishment and sent to deliver an ultimatum to the French ordering them to desist from their encroachments in the Ohio Valley. In 1754 he became lieutenant colonel of the Virginia Regiment, due in part to his backcountry knowledge and map-making skills gained from surveying. In 1774 the Virginia provincial convention elected George Washington to be one of the seven delegates to the first continental congress and he served in the second continental congress the following year. During the assembly of the second continental congress assembled in Philadelphia in May 1775, George Washington was elected Commander in Chief of the continental army. On July 3, 1775, at Cambridge, Massachusetts, he took command of the continental army.</p>
<p>George Washington skillfully led the continental army through all phases of the American Revolution. This includes the siege of Boston, battles of Trenton and Princeton, wintering at Valley Forge, and the decisive victory at Yorktown. Upon conclusion of combat, George Washington voluntarily resigned his commission to the second continental congress, thereby exemplifying civilian authority over the military.</p>
<p>After the war, George Washington was influential in shaping the various provisions of the nation's Constitution at the constitutional convention in Philadelphia in 1787. When the new Constitution was ratified by the states, the electoral college unanimously elected George Washington as the nation's first president.</p>
<p>George Washington served two terms as president of the United States. During his presidency, George Washington established the norms and customs for his successors, avoided combat with major European powers, and set the United States on a path to security and prosperity. He voluntarily left office in 1797, declining to run for a third term, and returned to private life at Mount Vernon.</p>
<p>Upon his death, George Washington was mourned by the nation and eulogized by Henry &quot;Light Horse Harry&quot; Lee as &quot;First in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.&quot;</p>
<p>On November 11, 1889, the state of Washington was admitted as the 42nd state of the United States of America. Recognizing the unique historical stature of George Washington, the state was named in his honor.</p>
<p>In recognition of his service to this country, George Washington's birthday became the first federal holiday to honor an individual's birthdate. February 22nd was observed as a public federal holiday until 1971 when former President Nixon declared a single holiday to be called Presidents' Day which would be observed on the third Monday in February in order to honor all past presidents. However, the name Presidents' Day never became the legal name of the holiday and the day is still legally called George Washington's Birthday on official federal government writings.</p>
<p>With the impending 250th anniversary of the United States occurring on July 4, 2026, changing the name of the state holiday known as Presidents' Day to George Washington's Birthday (observed) is more appropriate as the nation reflects on their founding generation and the life and legacy of George Washington.</p>
