# HB 1515 - Alcohol service in public

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1515.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that updating and modernizing the regulation of alcohol service in public spaces by building upon the regulatory framework established in agency rules governing this activity will benefit the citizens of Washington, the restaurant and hospitality industry, nonprofit organizations, as well as local and state government in Washington, and will help prepare Washington to successfully host a major international sports event in 2026.

2. The legislature intends that passage and implementation of this act will allow for event environments that emphasize safe crowd management of high volumes of people, a pleasant event experience that maximizes mobility for event guests, especially families, and maintains safe operations that ensure alcohol is not accessed or consumed by persons under age 21 and alcohol does not leave the premises.

3. Therefore, the legislature intends to authorize local governments to request from the liquor and cannabis board, and for the board to reasonably approve, that expanded outdoor alcohol service in public spaces be allowed for liquor licensees in their jurisdictions, and to authorize certain cities to request from the liquor and cannabis board, and for the board to reasonably approve, that expanded outdoor and indoor alcohol service in public spaces be allowed for liquor licensees operating during events on publicly owned civic campuses subject to the requirements of this act.

## Section 2

A city, town, or county may request, and the board may approve, expanded outdoor alcohol service for liquor licensees within the whole city, town, or county, or within a specific area or areas of the city, town, or county, as provided in (b) and (c) of this subsection (1). If requested by a county, the approval may only be for unincorporated areas of the county.

    b. For licensees identified in (c) of this subsection (1) who have requested approval from and been authorized by the board's licensing division to conduct outdoor alcohol service, and who are located within an area of a city, town, or county that has been approved by the board for expanded outdoor alcohol service, the following authorizations and requirements apply:

        i. An outdoor alcohol service area may be enclosed by means of a permanent or movable barrier of a minimum height specified by the board, or by means of a permanent fence-free demarcation, for all types of events including beer gardens, standing room only venues, and permitted special events;

        ii. For an outdoor alcohol service area enclosed by means of a permanent or movable barrier of a minimum height specified by the board, no permanent or movable barrier is required to enclose any parts of the perimeter of the outdoor alcohol service area on sloped site conditions where such conditions reasonably prevent access by persons;
