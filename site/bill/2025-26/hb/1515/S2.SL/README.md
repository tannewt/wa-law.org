# HB 1515 - Alcohol service in public

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1515-S2.SL.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that updating and modernizing the regulation of alcohol service in public spaces by building upon the regulatory framework established in agency rules governing this activity will benefit the citizens of Washington, the restaurant and hospitality industry, nonprofit organizations, as well as local and state government in Washington, and will help prepare Washington to successfully host a major international sports event in 2026.

2. The legislature intends that passage and implementation of this act will allow for event environments that emphasize safe crowd management of high volumes of people, a pleasant event experience that maximizes mobility for event guests, especially families, and maintains safe operations that ensure alcohol is not accessed or consumed by persons under age 21, overservice is prevented, and alcohol does not leave the premises.

3. Therefore, subject to the requirements in this section:

    a. From the effective date of this section until December 31, 2027, the legislature intends to authorize local governments to request from the liquor and cannabis board, and for the board to reasonably approve, that expanded outdoor alcohol service in public spaces be allowed for liquor licensees in their jurisdictions;

    b. From the effective date of this section until December 31, 2027, the legislature intends to authorize certain cities to request from the liquor and cannabis board, and for the board to reasonably approve, that expanded outdoor and indoor alcohol service in public spaces be allowed for liquor licensees operating during events on publicly owned civic campuses; and

    c. During the months of June and July of 2026, the legislature intends to authorize certain local governments to request from the liquor and cannabis board, and for the board to reasonably approve, that expanded outdoor and indoor alcohol service in public spaces be allowed for certain liquor licensees operating during a single multiday event in an approved area or areas of a city, town, county, or port authority that is a designated fan zone or host city.
