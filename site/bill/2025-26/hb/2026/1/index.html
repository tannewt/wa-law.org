<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature acknowledges that every public school in Washington state should receive equal funding on a per-pupil basis, directly correlated to the number of students served. However, the legislature finds that schools in wealthier census tracts are better funded, providing their students with access to higher quality facilities and resources.</p>
<p>The legislature intends that every student, regardless of socioeconomic background or geographic location of residence within the state, should receive roughly equal priority and funding for the provision of education, as stated in the Washington state Constitution. Local levies, local capital funding, and local enrichment levies inherently favor schools in wealthy census tracts over those in high-poverty census tracts and should therefore be abolished and replaced with state funding that demonstrates to the public and to every public school student in the state that their education is valued, prioritized, and funded at the same level as every other public school and public school student in the state of Washington.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>For the purposes of this section, the staff allocations for classroom teachers, teacher-librarians, counselors, and student health services staff under RCW 28A.150.260 are considered allocations for certificated instructional staff.</li>
</ol>

<p>Until the 2025-26 school year, the minimum state allocation for salaries for certificated instructional staff in the basic education program must be increased to provide a statewide average allocation of $64,000 adjusted for inflation from the 2017-18 school year.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Until the 2025-26 school year, the minimum state allocation for salaries for certificated administrative staff in the basic education program must be increased to provide a statewide average allocation of $95,000 adjusted for inflation from the 2017-18 school year.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Until the 2025-26 school year, state allocations for salaries for certificated instructional staff, certificated administrative staff, and classified staff must be adjusted for regional differences in the cost of hiring staff. Adjustments for regional differences must be specified in the omnibus appropriations act for each school year through at least school year 2022-23. Beginning with the 2026-27 school year, all school districts will receive the same state salary allocations as prescribed in subsection (6) of this section for certificated instructional staff, certificated administrative staff, and classified staff with no regional adjustments.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall, where it is practicable to do so within available resources, prepare school district fiscal notes on proposed legislation that increases or decreases, or tends to increase or decrease, school district revenues or expenditures in a manner that uniquely affects school districts.

The fiscal note must set forth any assumptions that were used in selecting the representative districts, along with any other assumptions made about the fiscal impact.</p>
</li>
