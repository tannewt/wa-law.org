# HB 1166 - DOC reentry education

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1166.pdf)

## Section 1
This act may be known and cited as the providing effective education for reentry success act.

## Section 2
The legislature recognizes that people who experience prolonged gaps in education face significant challenges in academic and personal development, particularly if those gaps occur during critical developmental years. The legislature intends to prioritize timely access to education during an incarcerated individual's developmental years while also prioritizing continuity of enrollment for students who resume their education later in life. Therefore, the legislature intends to establish the providing effective education for reentry success act to ensure that incarcerated individuals can meaningfully pursue postsecondary education and digital literacy.

Furthermore, the legislature finds that the goals of digital equity, inclusion, and literacy include incarcerated individuals. The legislature intends that the department of corrections implement security and monitoring of internet access by incarcerated individuals in a manner that does not hinder participation in postsecondary education degree programs or digital equity, inclusion, and literacy. The legislature intends to encourage incarcerated individuals to pursue postsecondary education and digital literacy by enabling equitable and inclusive access to online learning through Wifi, including the opportunity to possess, as personal property, laptop computers with Wifi capability, together with the accessories necessary for online learning. The legislature intends that the department ensure that no correctional facility enter any contract or implement any regulation in a manner that hinders an incarcerated individual from enrolling in an accredited program of distance learning at an institution of higher education as access to online distance education is necessary to create significant educational pathways that meet the diverse educational aspirations of incarcerated individuals.

The legislature supports the use of digital devices, such as continuous glucose, heart rate, and sleep quality monitors, by incarcerated individuals to improve health outcomes. The legislature finds that education and health work together to support rehabilitation and successful reentry, and that personal health technologies can improve the lives of incarcerated individuals.

## Section 3

## Section 4
1. Recognizing that there is a positive correlation between education opportunities and reduced recidivism, it is the intent of the legislature to offer appropriate postsecondary degree or certificate opportunities to incarcerated individuals.

2. The legislature intends that all incarcerated individuals be required to participate in department-approved education programs, work programs, or both, unless exempted as specifically provided in this section. Eligible incarcerated individuals who refuse to participate in available education or work programs available at no charge to the incarcerated individuals shall lose privileges according to the system established under RCW 72.09.130. Eligible incarcerated individuals who are required to contribute financially to an education or work program and refuse to contribute shall be placed in another work program. Refusal to contribute shall not result in a loss of privileges.

3. The legislature recognizes more incarcerated individuals may agree to participate in education and work programs than are available. The department must make every effort to achieve maximum public benefit by placing incarcerated individuals in available and appropriate education and work programs.

4. [Empty]

    a. The department shall, to the extent possible and considering all available funds, prioritize its resources to meet the following goals for incarcerated individuals in the order listed:

        ii. Achievement of vocational skills necessary for purposes of work programs and for an incarcerated individual to qualify for work upon release;

        iii. Additional work and education programs necessary for compliance with an incarcerated individual's individual reentry plan under RCW 72.09.270, including special education services and postsecondary degree or certificate education programs; and

    b. [Empty]

        i. If programming is provided pursuant to (a)(i) through (iii) of this subsection, the department shall pay the cost of such programming, including but not limited to books, materials, and supplies for adult basic education programs and any postsecondary education program that is not financial aid eligible at the time the individual is enrolled or paid for by the department or third party.

        ii. For financial aid eligible postsecondary programming provided pursuant to (a)(i) through (iii) of this subsection, the department may require the individual to apply for any federal and state financial aid grants available to the individual as a condition of participation in such programming. The individual may elect to use available financial aid grants, self-pay, or any other available third-party funding, or use a combination of these methods to cover the cost of attendance for financial aid eligible postsecondary programming provided under this subsection (4)(b)(ii). If an individual elects to self-pay or utilize third-party funding, the individual is not subject to the postaward formula described in (c) of this subsection. If the cost of attendance exceeds any financial grant awards that may be available to the individual, or the person is not eligible for federal or state financial aid grants, the department shall pay the cost of attendance not otherwise covered by third-party funding. All regulations and requirements set forth by the United States department of education for federal pell grants for prison education programs apply to financial aid eligible postsecondary programming.

    c. If programming is provided pursuant to (a)(iv) of this subsection, incarcerated individuals shall be required to pay all or a portion of the costs, including books, fees, and tuition, for participation in any vocational, work, or education program as provided in department policies. The individual may apply for and utilize federal and state financial aid grants available to the individual. If the individual is not eligible for federal financial aid grants, the individual may apply for and utilize state financial aid grants available to the individual. Department policies shall include a postaward formula for determining how much an incarcerated individual shall be required to pay after deducting any amount from available financial aid or other available sources. The postaward formula shall include steps which correlate to an incarcerated individual's average monthly income or average available balance in a personal savings account and which are correlated to a prorated portion or percent of the per credit fee for tuition, books, or other ancillary educational costs. Any postaward formula offsets and funds paid for by the department for educational programming shall not result in the reduction of any gift aid. The postaward formula shall be reviewed every two years. A third party, including but not limited to nonprofit entities or community-based postsecondary education programs, may pay directly to the department all or a portion of costs and tuition for any programming provided pursuant to (a)(iv) of this subsection on behalf of an incarcerated individual. Such payments shall not be subject to any of the deductions as provided in this chapter.

    d. All incarcerated individuals shall receive financial aid and academic advising from an accredited institution of higher education prior to enrollment in a financial aid eligible postsecondary education program. Eligible individuals who choose not to participate or choose to cease participation in a financial aid eligible postsecondary education program shall not result in a loss of privileges.

    e. Correspondence courses are ineligible for state and federal financial aid funding unless such course is part of a program leading to an associate, bachelor, or graduate degree.

The program of education established by the department and education provider under RCW 28A.193.020 for incarcerated individuals under the age of eighteen must provide each incarcerated individual a choice of curriculum that will assist the incarcerated individual in achieving a high school diploma or high school equivalency certificate. The program of education may include but not be limited to basic education, prevocational training, work ethic skills, conflict resolution counseling, substance abuse intervention, and anger management counseling. The curriculum may balance these and other rehabilitation, work, and training components.

6. [Empty]

    a. In addition to the policies set forth in this section, the department shall consider the following factors in establishing criteria for assessing the inclusion of education and work programs in an incarcerated individual's individual reentry plan and in placing incarcerated individuals in education and work programs:

        i. An incarcerated individual's release date and custody level. An incarcerated individual shall not be precluded from participating in an education or work program solely on the basis of his or her release date, except that incarcerated individuals with a release date of more than one hundred twenty months in the future shall not comprise more than ten percent of incarcerated individuals participating in a new class I correctional industry not in existence on June 10, 2004;

        ii. An incarcerated individual's education history and basic academic skills;

9. The department shall establish, and periodically review, goals for expanding access to postsecondary degree and certificate education programs and program completion for all incarcerated individuals, including persons of color.

10. The department shall establish, by rule, objective medical standards to determine when an incarcerated individual is physically or mentally unable to participate in available education or work programs. When the department determines an incarcerated individual is permanently unable to participate in any available education or work program due to a health condition, the incarcerated individual is exempt from the requirement under subsection (2) of this section. When the department determines an incarcerated individual is temporarily unable to participate in an education or work program due to a medical condition, the incarcerated individual is exempt from the requirement of subsection (2) of this section for the period of time he or she is temporarily disabled.

Department policies shall include a formula for determining how much an incarcerated individual shall be required to pay. The formula shall include steps which correlate to an incarcerated individual's average monthly income or average available balance in a personal savings account and which are correlated to a prorated portion or percent of the per credit fee for tuition, books, or other ancillary costs. The formula shall be reviewed every two years. A third party may pay directly to the department all or a portion of costs and tuition for any program on behalf of an incarcerated individual under this subsection. Such payments shall not be subject to any of the deductions as provided in this chapter.
