<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The intent of this chapter is to establish a better understanding of current and needed systems for managing textiles and apparel, with a goal of providing information that may be useful to the potential future adoption of a statewide extended producer responsibility program for apparel and textile articles that emphasizes repair and reuse, and minimizes hazardous waste, greenhouse gases, environmental impacts, negative environmental justice impacts, and negative public health impacts. It is not the intent of the legislature that the definitions, processes, or needs assessment carried out under this act be determinative of decisions by a future legislature regarding how to structure or right-size a potential future extended producer responsibility program.</p>

x. An assessment of the availability of existing organizations that repair, repurpose, and upcycle covered products;

xi. An evaluation of the availability or lack of availability of responsible markets for repaired, reused, and recycled covered products, the need to incentivize reused, repurposed, repaired, and upcycled products or recycled material market development, and the associated investments or actions needed to ensure that the covered products are reused, repaired, repurposed, upcycled, or recycled and have responsible and economically viable and sufficient markets;

xii. An evaluation of the factors contributing to the presence of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances and other chemicals identified or regulated under chapters 70A.350 and 70A.430 RCW, and the actions and investments needed to avoid contamination related to recycling. This must include available markets for recycled material that cannot be remanufactured into apparel or textile articles in Washington; and

xiii. An evaluation of what factors will be important to successfully implement an eco-modulated fee structure, and what associated data collection is recommended for future inclusion as part of a plan to implement an extended producer responsibility program. The eco-modulated fee assumed under this subsection must reflect Washington sales volume, existing producer collection, repair, reuse, and recycling programs that help achieve the purposes of this chapter, and the cost of reusing, repairing, repurposing, upcycling, recycling, or otherwise managing covered products under this chapter. The intent of the eco-modulated fee would be to incentivize design choices that facilitate the achievement of goals outlined in the plan, including reuse, repair, repurposing, upcycling, and recycling, and the reduction and removal of harmful chemicals, microfiber and microplastic shedding, and mixed material blends through reduced fees, while using malus fees to disincentivize practices and materials incongruent with the plan goals. The producer responsibility organization would be required to consider existing collection, repair, reuse, repurposing, upcycling, and recycling programs in developing the eco-modulated fee structure.
