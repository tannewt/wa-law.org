## Section 1

It is not the intent of the legislature that the definitions, processes, or needs assessment carried out under this act be determinative of decisions by a future legislature regarding how to structure or right-size a potential future extended producer responsibility program.

    e. To the extent practicable, the needs assessment carried out under this section may be developed in conjunction with, or use information from, similar evaluative processes related to textile and apparel extended producer responsibility laws in other jurisdictions.

2. The needs assessments must presume that the program that would be implemented after a needs assessment would:

    a. Establish a free, equitable, and convenient drop-off or collection system that meets convenience standards for the collection of covered products and related performance standards and metrics. This would provide for a reasonable and equitable geographic spread of permanent collection sites and include, at minimum, permanent collection sites in each county that:

        iv. Maximize the reuse, repair, repurposing, upcycling, and recycling of all covered products, and minimize disposal of covered products collected by the producer responsibility organization; and

    v. Prioritize, to the extent feasible, the use and development of sorting, repair, and recycling facilities located closer to the point of collection to minimize transportation-related emissions and increase accountability for the ultimate disposition of covered products;

    c. Operate consistent with best practices for management of covered products consistent with the waste management hierarchy established in RCW 70A.205.005(8);

    d. Prioritize the use of secondhand markets of covered products when establishing collection sites to meet the minimum collection requirements;

3. The needs assessment must comply with all of the following:

    a. Be designed to inform a budget and plan to implement an extended producer responsibility program designed to result in the acceptance and management of all postconsumer covered products;

    b. Propose and rely upon quantifiable five-year and annual performance standards and metrics that the extended producer responsibility program would be required to achieve, that demonstrate continuous improvement over time; and

    c. Include an evaluation of all of the following with respect to covered products and covered product categories:

        i. Existing scope and scale of annual covered products:

(B) Diverted to reuse, repair, or recycling in the state or from the state by type of covered product, material composition, and volume; and

(C) Exported to other countries, the destination of such exports, and final disposition of such exports, by type of covered product, material composition, and volume;

        ii. The current repair, reuse, recycling, collection, sorting, and hauling system in the state and the expanded access and additional repair, reuse, recycling, collection, sorting, disassembly, and hauling options needed to meet the intent of this chapter;

        iii. Current market conditions, including rates of textile and apparel export, and the need to create responsible and economically viable markets in the state, regionally, and globally;

Fee reduction or redistribution mechanisms may consider existing producer collection, repair, reuse, repurposing, and recycling programs that help achieve the intent of this chapter;

        ix. Actions and investments necessary to provide equitable and sufficient access to collection, repurposing, recycling, composting, processing, and transportation to responsible and economically viable markets;

    x. An assessment of the availability of existing organizations that repair, repurpose, and upcycle covered products;

    xi. An evaluation of the availability or lack of availability of responsible markets for repaired, reused, and recycled covered products, the need to incentivize reused, repurposed, repaired, and upcycled products or recycled material market development, and the associated investments or actions needed to ensure that the covered products are reused, repaired, repurposed, upcycled, or recycled and have responsible and economically viable and sufficient markets;

    xii. An evaluation of the factors contributing to the presence of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances and other chemicals identified or regulated under chapters 70A.350 and 70A.430 RCW, and the actions and investments needed to avoid contamination related to recycling. This must include available markets for recycled material that cannot be remanufactured into apparel or textile articles in Washington; and

    xiii. An evaluation of what factors will be important to successfully implement an eco-modulated fee structure, and what associated data collection is recommended for future inclusion as part of a plan to implement an extended producer responsibility program. The eco-modulated fee assumed under this subsection must reflect Washington sales volume, existing producer collection, repair, reuse, and recycling programs that help achieve the purposes of this chapter, and the cost of reusing, repairing, repurposing, upcycling, recycling, or otherwise managing covered products under this chapter. The intent of the eco-modulated fee would be to incentivize design choices that facilitate the achievement of goals outlined in the plan, including reuse, repair, repurposing, upcycling, and recycling, and the reduction and removal of harmful chemicals, microfiber and microplastic shedding, and mixed material blends through reduced fees, while using malus fees to disincentivize practices and materials incongruent with the plan goals. The producer responsibility organization would be required to consider existing collection, repair, reuse, repurposing, upcycling, and recycling programs in developing the eco-modulated fee structure.

4. A textile and apparel coordinating organization must develop each needs assessment in consultation with the advisory council created in section 11 of this act and a broad diversity of government entities, collection, brokering, reuse, repair, and recycling service providers, and processors that reflect the different needs and challenges presented by managing different covered products through final disposition.

5. Based on the needs assessment, the department must submit to the appropriate committees of the legislature an evaluation of the current status of extended producer responsibility program implementation in other jurisdictions, including identified best practices or design features potentially salient for program design in Washington, and recommendations for how the 2029 legislature should design an extended producer responsibility program consistent with the intent of this chapter. The recommendations must be submitted together with the needs assessment by September 15, 2028. The department's recommendations should consider and, as appropriate, include:

    a. Proposed deviations from the definitions established in section 2 of this act, including the definitions of "producer," "apparel," and "textile," including related adjustments to the scope of covered entities and products under a potential future extended producer responsibility program, as compared to the scope of covered entities and products contemplated in the needs assessment; and

    b. Recommendations addressing whether to allow multiple producer responsibility organizations, not counting individual producer responsibility organizations, for purposes of implementing a potential future extended producer responsibility program.
