# HB 1550 - Electric vehicle batteries

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1550.pdf)

## Section 1
1. In addition to the findings described in RCW 70A.555.005, the legislature finds that:

    a. In 2023, the legislature enacted producer responsibility requirements for most types of smaller and medium-sized batteries, but elected to further study how to best manage electric vehicle batteries prior to establishing producer responsibility requirements for such batteries;

    b. In January of 2024, the state of New Jersey enacted the nation's first producer responsibility law focused on electric vehicle batteries; and

    c. The state of California has taken important steps that will facilitate electric vehicle battery recycling, including by establishing requirements for electric vehicle battery labeling.

2. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to make producers responsible for the end-of-life management of electric vehicle batteries, in order to ensure economically and environmentally beneficial use of the valuable resources contained in electric vehicle batteries.
