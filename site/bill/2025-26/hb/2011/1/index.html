<p>Pursuant to the phase-in schedule set forth in (c) of this subsection (3), the court must appoint an attorney for every child in a dependency proceeding as follows:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>For a child under the age of eight, appointment must be made for the dependency and termination action upon the filing of a termination petition. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the ability of the court to appoint an attorney to represent the child's position in a dependency action on its own initiative, or upon the request of a parent, the child, a guardian ad litem, a caregiver, or the department, prior to the filing of a termination petition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a child between the ages of eight through 17, appointment must be made upon the filing of a new dependency petition at or before the commencement of the shelter care hearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For any pending or open dependency case where the child is unrepresented and is entitled to the appointment of an attorney under (a)(i) or (ii) of this subsection, appointment must be made at or before the next hearing if the child is eligible for representation pursuant to the phase-in schedule. At the next hearing, the court shall inquire into the status of attorney representation for the child, and if the child is not yet represented, appointment must be made at the hearing.</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appointment is not required if the court has already appointed an attorney for the child, or the child is represented by a privately retained attorney.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The statewide children's legal representation program shall develop a schedule for court appointment of attorneys for every child in dependency proceedings that will be phased in on a county-by-county basis over an 11-year period. The schedule required under this subsection must not add more than 1,250 cases each fiscal year and:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>To the extent practicable, prioritize implementation in counties that have:</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) No current practice of appointment of attorneys for children in dependency cases; or</p>
<p>(B) Significant prevalence of racial disproportionality or disparities in the number of dependent children compared to the general population, or both;</p>

<pre><code>    iii. Achieve full statewide implementation by January 1, 2032.

d. In cases where the statewide children's legal representation program provides funding and where consistent with its administration and oversight responsibilities, the statewide children's legal representation program should prioritize continuity of counsel for children who are already represented at county expense when the statewide children's legal representation program becomes effective in a county. The statewide children's legal representation program shall coordinate with relevant county stakeholders to determine how best to prioritize this continuity of counsel.

e. The statewide children's legal representation program is responsible for the recruitment, training, and oversight of attorneys providing standards-based representation pursuant to (a) and (c) of this subsection as provided in RCW 2.53.045 and shall ensure that attorneys representing children pursuant to this section provide legal services according to the rules of professional conduct, the standards of practice, caseload limits, and training guidelines adopted by the children's representation work group established in section 9, chapter 210, Laws of 2021.
