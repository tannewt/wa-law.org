<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Washington state intends to lead the world in the quality of life and the environmental attributes of its cities. The legislature recognizes that major environmental health disparities exist within urban areas and that the architectural design of urban areas plays a critical role in the function and health of the ecosystems they inhabit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that the built environment itself can be a cause of various forms of pollution that harm humans and wildlife. These forms of pollution include, but are not limited to, noise pollution, light pollution, water pollution through impervious surfaces that channel untreated stormwater runoff to waterways, and building materials that radiate heat causing an urban heat island effect. While regulation, incentives, investments, and innovations in the energy and transportation sector will begin to address harmful air emissions in urban areas, the state recognizes that additional policy leadership and creativity must be directed to reducing these additional forms of pollution that are a by-product of a densely built urban environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that there are significant opportunities for incorporating architectural and landscape design in urban areas and the built environment with myriad environmental and health benefits. These benefits include increased biodiversity, air quality, and harmonization with the natural environment, along with decreased energy use and mitigation of harmful impacts of buildings. Design approaches that promote these benefits include green and sustainable architecture, which focus on reducing negative impacts from buildings, biophilic architecture, which seeks to better connect occupants with nature, and regenerative architecture, which involves buildings capable of breaking down at end-of-life, to a net ecological benefit. These design approaches can be achieved at the landscape and neighborhood scale to also incorporate parks, recreation areas, and walkable amenities with more permeable and natural surfaces that draw communities together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to create a center for sustainable urban design to provide leadership, to inspire the public with new possibilities for environmentally sustainable urban spaces, to generate policy solutions, and to identify potential projects that would make measurable improvement in environmental outcomes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
