<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that nearly 40 percent of Washington households are renter households. Washington is one of the most expensive rental markets in the country. Rent increases are outpacing incomes, disproportionately impacting: Seniors; Black, indigenous, and people of color households; and families with children, and are a significant cause of homelessness. As of November 2024, Washington was experiencing the highest eviction filing count on record, with 23,000 filings and with nine counties already breaking records, including Clark, Grant, Jefferson, King, Klickitat, Okanogan, Spokane, Thurston, and Whitman. Seven additional counties were also on track to break records in 2024, including Asotin, Columbia, Douglas, Kittitas, Pend Oreille, Skagit and Walla Walla.</p>
<p>A significant surge in unlawful detainer filings has contributed to delays in court proceedings and case resolutions, creating additional burdens for both landlords and tenants.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that the right to counsel program in eviction proceedings provides a vital safety net for low-income renters, providing access to attorneys to ensure procedural fairness in court and significantly reducing the risk of housing loss and evictions into homelessness. Since January 2022, every tenant screened and found eligible has been assigned an attorney through an eviction defense provider contracted by the office of civil legal aid. Of the clients served, 39 percent had a disability and 45 percent were Black, indigenous, and people of color.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to address delays in court proceedings by authorizing superior courts, with the consent of the county legislative authority, to appoint well-trained and unbiased court commissioners who can hear unlawful detainer cases.</p>
<p>The legislature respectfully requests that superior courts continue to closely coordinate their dockets with right to counsel assignments for eligible defendants in unlawful detainer cases, and encourages the courts to give consideration to the availability of right to counsel attorneys when expanding their dockets.</p>
