<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that, as western Washington has grown more urban and eastern and southwest Washington have, in contrast, remained more rural since Washington's statehood, there has followed an extreme division of philosophy and values between these two distinct regions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further recognizes that the Declaration of Independence validates that when a government fails to represent a people &quot;it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further recognizes that in Federalist No. 40 by James Madison, it is the precious right of the people to &quot;abolish or alter their governments as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further recognizes that in Federalist No. 63 by James Madison, &quot;The difference most relied on, between the American and other republics, consists in the principle of representation.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further recognizes that the national environmental policy act (P.L. 91-190, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 4321 et seq., as amended) defines the human environment as consisting of ecological, aesthetic, historic, cultural, social, and health elements of life in the communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further recognizes that Article I, section 1 of the state Constitution states that &quot;All political power is inherent in the people, and governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, and are established to protect and maintain individual rights.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to divide the state into two autonomous regions, the Puget Sound region and the Columbia region, by constitutional amendment. Each region would provide regional governors, regional legislators, and regional judges. The state of Washington will remain a single state for purposes of federal elections as proposed in New York Senate Bill 2023-S3093.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends that the boundaries for the Columbia region will encompass all Washington counties east of the Cascade mountain range and bordering the Columbia river. The Puget Sound region will encompass all Washington counties bordering Puget Sound, and north of and within the Olympic Peninsula. These boundaries do not preclude counties or precincts from joining either district provided they are geographically contiguous to their chosen district.</p>
