# HB 2319 - Renaming certain state residential facilities for persons with developmental disabilities.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2319.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that Washington maintains a system of residential habilitation centers providing residential habilitative support for primarily adult individuals with developmental disabilities. Services at these facilities include medical and dental treatment, training in daily living skills, nursing services, employment services, and myriad other therapies and supports. Three of the four residential habilitation centers that are currently in use, as well as one former facility, are officially referred to in statute as schools. This does not accurately reflect the primary function or purpose of these facilities.

Therefore, the legislature intends to officially rename these facilities residential habilitation centers. The legislature does not intend to change the purpose or operations of these facilities in any way by renaming them, nor does it intend for the renaming to have any direct or indirect effect on access to funding for these facilities; rather, it seeks to clarify that these are habilitative facilities, rather than educational institutions, and make the names of the residential habilitation centers consistent on a systemwide basis.

## Section 2
1. The following residential habilitation centers are renamed:

    a. Fircrest school is renamed Fircrest residential habilitation center;

    b. Rainier school is renamed Rainier residential habilitation center; and

    c. Yakima Valley school is renamed Yakima Valley residential habilitation center.

2. Lakeland Village residential habilitation center will continue to be named Lakeland Village residential habilitation center.

3. References to the former Interlake school will be to Interlake residential habilitation center.

4. Any existing references to Fircrest school, Rainier school, or Yakima Valley school retain full force and effect as would a reference to the updated names as identified in subsection (1) of this section.

5. The department of social and health services shall update rules and make other changes necessary to reflect the current names of the facilities as identified in this section.

## Section 3
