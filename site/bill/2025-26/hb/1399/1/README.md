# HB 1399 - Sheriffs, chiefs, etc.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1399.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that specific laws governing the eligibility requirements, duties, and responsibilities of sheriffs, police chiefs, and marshals should be updated and revised to reflect current best practices, and to ensure that local law enforcement executives, whether sheriffs, police chiefs, or marshals, whether appointed or elected, or whether partisan or nonpartisan, are subject to the same requirements and standards. By establishing such consistent requirements and standards, the legislature intends to enhance the effectiveness, professionalism, and accountability of law enforcement executives, to promote public trust and confidence in law enforcement, and to increase community safety.

Where all those who serve in law enforcement must maintain their peace officer certification, the legislature finds that state law should be clear regarding actions taken when a sheriff, police chief, or marshal has their certification revoked, to ensure that state law reflects consistent principles of strong accountability for all ranks.

The legislature finds further that specially commissioned officers and volunteers, if retained by local law enforcement executives to assist with agency needs, should be limited to roles that do not involve taking law enforcement actions, including the carrying of firearms or other weapons, the detention and arrest of others, and the use of force and deadly force, unless the person has completed peace officer training and certification requirements, and that law enforcement agencies must have policies circumscribing the permissible roles for volunteers, including search and rescue, care of animals, and chaplaincy, and limitations on use of uniforms and badges.

The legislature also intends to clarify and reinforce state law establishing that the core duty of sheriffs is to enforce the Washington state Constitution and laws, as enacted by the legislature and interpreted by the Washington supreme court, which is in alignment with the Washington supreme court's ruling in In re Recall of Fortney, 196 Wn.2d 766 (2021).

The legislature further finds that antiquated laws regarding "police matrons" should be repealed.
