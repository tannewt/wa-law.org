<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that ranchers, farmers, rural property owners, and others who live and work in the rural areas of our state that are most susceptible to the threat of wildfire are uniquely situated, by virtue of their knowledge of the land and proximity to wildfires, to provide critical initial attack firefighting capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rangeland fire protection associations have the potential to offer a coordinated approach to wildland fire suppression by taking advantage of the quick initial attack capabilities of those already out on the land, addressing the desire of those living and working in wildland areas to be active participants in protecting the places where they live and work, ensuring that all those engaged in the wildland firefighting effort have the necessary training, equipment, and communications capabilities, and supporting the state's efforts to provide a complete, coordinated approach to wildland fire prevention, detection, and suppression.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accordingly, it is the intent of the legislature that the department of natural resources implement a five-year pilot project in eastern Washington in order to assess the effectiveness of rangeland fire protection associations in Washington.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The department shall conduct a rangeland fire protection association pilot project in order to better assess the measures needed to ensure the safe and effective operation of rangeland fire protection associations. The pilot project must be conducted in the location specified in subsection (4) of this section. The pilot project must be operational by the beginning of calendar year 2026 and must conclude at the end of calendar year 2029.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The operations of rangeland fire protection associations must comply with the requirements established in sections 3 through 5 of this act. In addition, in implementing this pilot project, the department:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Shall develop and publish recommendations concerning the formation, management, operation, and training of members of a rangeland fire protection association, including the determination of the safety, administrative, and training requirements that must be met; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shall, prior to entering into an agreement with a rangeland fire protection association, and at least annually thereafter, review and inspect the rangeland fire protection association for the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The governance and management structure of the rangeland fire protection association;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The adequacy of liability insurance; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The training of all rangeland fire protection association personnel.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A rangeland fire protection association operating as part of the pilot project authorized by this act may enter into agreements with fire protection service agencies for the detection, prevention, or suppression of fires. Subject to the approval of the department, the fire protection service agency may negotiate the form and content of the agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall conduct the rangeland fire protection association pilot project east of the crest of the Cascade mountains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall submit a report on the pilot project as an appendix to the department's annual report to the appropriate committees of the legislature by December 1st of each year. The report must address, at a minimum, the following elements:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
