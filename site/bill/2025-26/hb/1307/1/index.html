<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that access to essential child care supplies, including diapers, car seats, baby clothing, and other necessary items, is critical for the health, safety, and well-being of infants, young children, and vulnerable adults. These supplies provide foundational support that promotes the health, dignity, and comfort of individuals across their lifespan, from infancy to elder care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that financial hardship disproportionately impacts families with infants and young children, with data showing that one in two families struggle to afford necessities like diapers. The high cost of these essentials can create significant stress and hardship, especially for low-income and single-parent households, who often have limited resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that infant care costs constitute nearly 50 percent of the total income of single-parent households, restricting these families' ability to afford other basic needs and often leading to long-term financial strain. Additionally, families who care for older adults or disabled individuals needing incontinence products bear high and recurring costs for these necessary items, further compounding their economic burden.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that diapers and other hygiene essentials are not luxuries, but critical items that prevent medical complications, maintain dignity, and support mental and physical health. The inability to afford these supplies can lead to health risks and emotional stress, impacting both family members who provide care and the individuals who rely on these essentials for daily living.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that one in four parents have missed work or school because they could not afford diapers. Similarly, families who must choose between essential incontinence products for adults and other critical needs may face diminished economic stability, limited job opportunities, and increased stress, further impacting the well-being of families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that exempting essential hygiene products, including diapers for infants, young children, and adults, from sales and use tax would provide significant financial relief to struggling families. By lowering the cost of these essentials, the legislature seeks to improve public health, reduce economic strain, and support the dignity and quality of life for individuals across all ages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to exempt certain essential products, including baby diapers, adult incontinence supplies, car seats, baby clothing, and other necessary items, from sales and use tax to reduce the financial burden on families and caregivers. This exemption is intended to promote equitable access to these essentials, support family stability, enhance public health, and uphold the dignity and well-being of infants, children, and adults in need of these products.</p>
