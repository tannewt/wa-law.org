# HB 1596 - Speeding

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Passed%20Legislature/1596-S.PL.pdf)

## Section 1
It is the intent of the legislature to keep the public safe when on the road. Nationwide, 29 percent of all crash fatalities occurred in speed-related crashes in 2022. In 2023, more than 30 percent of fatal crashes involved speeding on Washington roads. Speeding continues to be a component of traffic deaths, and law enforcement is increasingly dealing with more speed-related incidents. The legislature finds that all Washington drivers are at risk when speeding is involved, and solutions to change public behavior are needed.

Additionally, according to the American motor vehicle administration, more than 70 percent of people with suspended licenses continue to drive during the suspension period. By leveraging technology to enable individuals to continue driving and prevent speeding, the legislature intends to enhance road safety to promote safer driving habits and keep the public safe.

## Section 2
"Excessive speeding" means traveling at:

1. 10 miles per hour or greater in excess of the posted speed limit, if the posted speed limit is 40 miles per hour or less; and

2. 20 miles per hour or greater in excess of the posted speed limit, if the posted speed limit is greater than 40 miles per hour.

## Section 3
"Intelligent speed assistance device" means a technical device designed to be installed within a motor vehicle to actively monitor and prevent the driver from exceeding a preset limit. "Intelligent speed assistance device" does not include any technology that is provided by the vehicle manufacturer as a component of a new motor vehicle and that controls or affects the speed of a motor vehicle.

## Section 4
1. A person may not drive a motor vehicle, unless it is equipped with a functioning intelligent speed assistance device, configured and programmed as provided in section 5(3) of this act, if the device is required:

    a. For the issuance of a temporary restricted driver's license or an occupational driver's license, under the terms of RCW 46.20.391(4);

    b. Under the applicable terms of probation under RCW 46.20.2892(1) or 46.61.500(4); or

    c. Pursuant to court order under section 8 of this act or RCW 10.21.030.

2. The requirement to use the device under subsection (1) of this section with respect to a temporary restricted driver's license or occupational driver's license under RCW 46.20.391 remains in effect during the validity of any such license that has been issued to the person.

3. [Empty]

    a. A person who operates a motor vehicle with an intelligent speed assistance device remains exclusively responsible for the operation of the motor vehicle in a safe and lawful manner at all times.

    b. The obligation under this section to use an intelligent speed assistance device is not a defense or mitigating circumstance to a violation of rules of the road, as set forth in law.

4. [Empty]

    a. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, the installation of an intelligent speed assistance device is not necessary on vehicles owned, leased, or rented by a person's employer and on those vehicles whose care and/or maintenance is the temporary responsibility of the employer, and driven at the direction of a person's employer as a requirement of employment during working hours. The person must provide the department with a declaration pursuant to chapter 5.50 RCW from his or her employer stating that the person's employment requires the person to operate a vehicle owned by the employer or other persons during working hours. When the department receives a declaration under this subsection, it shall attach or imprint a notation on the person's driving record stating that the employer exemption applies.

    b. The employer exemption does not apply when the employer's vehicle is assigned exclusively to the restricted driver and used solely for commuting to and from employment.

5. Unless costs are waived by the intelligent speed assistance device company or the person is indigent under RCW 10.101.010, a person subject to the requirements of subsection (1) of this section shall pay the costs of installing, removing, and leasing the intelligent speed assistance device and shall pay an additional fee of $21 per month. Payments must be made directly to the intelligent speed assistance device company. The company shall remit the additional fee to the department to be deposited into the intelligent speed assistance device revolving account under section 9 of this act, except that the company may retain 25 cents per month of the additional fee to cover the expenses associated with administering the fee. The department may waive the monthly fee if the person is indigent under RCW 10.101.010.

6. For a person restricted under this section who is residing outside of the state of Washington, the department may accept verification of installation of an intelligent speed assistance device by an intelligent speed assistance device company authorized to do business in the jurisdiction or within a 75 mile radius of the jurisdiction in which the person resides, provided the device meets any applicable requirements of that jurisdiction. The department may waive the monthly fee required in subsection (5) of this section if collection of the fee would be impractical in the case of a person residing in another jurisdiction.

7. The department may issue rules to implement this section.

## Section 5
1. To be eligible to install, repair, maintain, monitor, or remove an intelligent speed assistance device, a person must apply to the department and meet the requirements as provided in this section.

The use of the override function under this subsection is subject to the requirements and limitations of RCW 46.61.425.

    c. All data collected under this act must be securely maintained by an intelligent speed assistance device company and may not be shared with any third parties, except for data pertaining to installation and removal of the device, without a court order.

4. To maintain eligibility under this section, a person must submit the results of a criminal background check to the department annually for any individual that is hired to install, repair, maintain, monitor, or remove the device.

5. The department may issue rules regarding the application process and eligibility under this section.

## Section 6
1. A person who is restricted to the use of a vehicle equipped with an intelligent speed assistance device is guilty of a gross misdemeanor if the restricted driver:

    a. Tampers with the device or any components of the device, or otherwise interferes with the proper functionality of the device, by modifying, detaching, disconnecting, or otherwise disabling it to allow the restricted driver to operate the vehicle; or

    b. Has, directs, authorizes, or requests another person to tamper with the device or any components of the device, or otherwise interfere with the proper functionality of the device, by modifying, detaching, disconnecting, or otherwise disabling it to allow the restricted driver to operate the vehicle.

2. A person who knowingly assists another person who is restricted to the use of a vehicle equipped with an intelligent speed assistance device to circumvent the device or any components of the device, or otherwise interferes with the proper functionality of the device, or to start and operate that vehicle is guilty of a gross misdemeanor. The provisions of this subsection do not apply if the starting of a motor vehicle, or the request to start a motor vehicle, equipped with an intelligent speed assistance device is done for the purpose of safety or mechanical repair of the device or the vehicle and the person subject to the court order does not operate the vehicle.

## Section 7
Any data collected by an intelligent speed assistance device as defined in section 3 of this act is exempt from disclosure under this chapter.

## Section 8
When sentencing a person convicted of any criminal offense under this chapter or a violation of any other provision of law that constitutes a misdemeanor, gross misdemeanor, or felony, the court may impose, as a condition of probation, a requirement regarding the installation and use of a functioning intelligent speed assistance device installed on all motor vehicles operated by the person. If the court finds that the person engaged in excessive speeding during the commission of the offense, the court shall impose the use of a functioning intelligent speed assistance device installed on all motor vehicles operated by the person for a period of not less than six months.

## Section 9
The intelligent speed assistance device revolving account is created in the state treasury. All receipts from the fee assessed under section 4(5) of this act must be deposited into the account. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Expenditures from the account may be used for administering and operating the intelligent speed assistance device revolving account program, implementing effective strategies to reduce motor vehicle-related deaths and serious injuries related to excessive speed.

## Section 10
1. A manufacturer, distributor, or retailer of a motor vehicle is not liable for any loss, injury, or damages caused by the design, manufacture, installation, improper installation, use, or misuse of an intelligent speed assistance device. However, liability does exist if the manufacturer, distributor or retailer knowingly engages in a repair or update to the intelligent speed assistance device and such repair or update proximately causes loss, injury, or damage.

2. Nothing in this chapter requires a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer of a motor vehicle to manufacture, distribute, or offer for sale a motor vehicle that includes or is compatible with an intelligent speed assistance device.

3. Nothing in this chapter prohibits a lessor or lienholder from requiring that a motor vehicle lessee or owner notify the lessor or lienholder that an intelligent speed assistance device has been installed on a motor vehicle that is subject to a lease or finance agreement.

## Section 11
1. The judicial officer in any felony, misdemeanor, or gross misdemeanor case may at any time amend the order to impose additional or different conditions of release. The conditions imposed under this chapter supplement but do not supplant provisions of law allowing the imposition of conditions to assure the appearance of the defendant at trial or to prevent interference with the administration of justice.

2. Appropriate conditions of release under this chapter include, but are not limited to, the following:

    a. The defendant may be placed in the custody of a pretrial release program;
