<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to keep the public safe when on the road. Nationwide, 29 percent of all crash fatalities occurred in speed-related crashes in 2022. In 2023, more than 30 percent of fatal crashes involved speeding on Washington roads. Speeding continues to be a component of traffic deaths, and law enforcement is increasingly dealing with more speed-related incidents. The legislature finds that all Washington drivers are at risk when speeding is involved, and solutions to change public behavior are needed.</p>
<p>Additionally, according to the American motor vehicle administration, more than 70 percent of people with suspended licenses continue to drive during the suspension period. By leveraging technology to enable individuals to continue driving and prevent speeding, the legislature intends to enhance road safety to promote safer driving habits and keep the public safe.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>&quot;Excessive speeding&quot; means traveling at:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>10 miles per hour or greater in excess of the posted speed limit, if the posted speed limit is 40 miles per hour or less; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>20 miles per hour or greater in excess of the posted speed limit, if the posted speed limit is greater than 40 miles per hour.</p>

<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<p>&quot;Intelligent speed assistance device&quot; means a technical device designed to be installed within a motor vehicle to actively monitor and prevent the driver from exceeding a preset limit. &quot;Intelligent speed assistance device&quot; does not include any technology that is provided by the vehicle manufacturer as a component of a new motor vehicle and that controls or affects the speed of a motor vehicle.</p>
