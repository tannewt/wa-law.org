# HB 1596 - Concerning accountability for persons for speeding.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1596.pdf)

## Section 1
It is the intent of the legislature to keep the public safe when on the road. Nationwide, 29 percent of all crash fatalities occurred in speed-related crashes in 2022. In 2023, more than 30 percent of fatal crashes involved speeding on Washington roads. Speeding continues to be a component of traffic deaths, and law enforcement is increasingly dealing with more speed-related incidents. The legislature finds that all Washington drivers are at risk when speeding is involved, and solutions to change public behavior are needed.

Additionally, according to the American motor vehicle administration, more than 70 percent of people with suspended licenses continue to drive during the suspension period. By leveraging technology to enable individuals to continue driving and prevent speeding, the legislature intends to enhance road safety to promote safer driving habits and keep the public safe.

## Section 2
"Excessive speeding" means traveling at 20 miles per hour or greater in excess of the posted speed limit.

## Section 3
"Intelligent speed assistance device" means a technical device designed to be installed within a motor vehicle to actively monitor and prevent the driver from exceeding a preset limit. "Intelligent speed assistance device" does not include any technology that is provided by the vehicle manufacturer as a component of a new motor vehicle and that controls or affects the speed of a motor vehicle.

## Section 4
"Intelligent speed restricted driver's license" means a driver's license issued under section 6 of this act.

## Section 5
A person is eligible to obtain an intelligent speed restricted driver's license under section 6 of this act if the person has had the person's driver's license suspended for any of the following reasons:

1. An accumulation of moving violations, under RCW 46.20.2892, and at least one of the violations was for excessive speeding; or

2. A conviction of reckless driving, under RCW 46.61.500, if the conviction was not a result of a reduced charge under RCW 46.61.502, 46.61.504, 46.61.520, or 46.61.522, and the conviction included a finding that the person was guilty of racing under RCW 46.61.530.

    b. The employer exemption does not apply when the employer's vehicle is assigned exclusively to the restricted driver and used solely for commuting to and from employment.

2. A person who knowingly assists another person who is restricted to the use of a vehicle equipped with an intelligent speed assistance device to circumvent the device or any components of the device, or otherwise interferes with the proper functionality of the device, or to start and operate that vehicle is guilty of a gross misdemeanor. The provisions of this subsection do not apply if the starting of a motor vehicle, or the request to start a motor vehicle, equipped with an intelligent speed assistance device is done for the purpose of safety or mechanical repair of the device or the vehicle and the person subject to the court order does not operate the vehicle.

## Section 10
When sentencing a person convicted of any criminal offense under this chapter or a violation of any other provision of law that constitutes a misdemeanor, gross misdemeanor, or felony, the court may impose, as a condition of probation, a requirement regarding the installation and use of a functioning intelligent speed assistance device installed on all motor vehicles operated by the person if the court finds that the person engaged in excessive speeding, as defined under section 2 of this act, during the commission of the offense.

Prior to reinstatement of a license, the person must complete a safe driving course as recommended by the department.

During the first 120 days of the period of probation, following the period of suspension for an accumulation of moving violations under this section in which one or more of the violations is for excessive speeding, as defined in section 2 of this act, the person may not operate a vehicle upon which a properly functioning intelligent speed assistance device has not been installed. The operation of a vehicle without such a properly functioning intelligent speed assistance device is a traffic infraction.

2.

4. For purposes of this section, multiple traffic infractions issued during or as the result of a single traffic stop constitute one occasion.

5. A person who is required to operate a motor vehicle with an intelligent speed assistance device under subsection (1) of this section remains exclusively responsible for operation of the motor vehicle in a safe and lawful manner at all times. The obligation under subsection (1) of this section to use an intelligent speed assistance device is not a defense or mitigating circumstance to a violation of rules of the road, as set forth in law.

## Section 14
1. No person may file an application for an occupational driver's license, a temporary restricted driver's license, an intelligent speed restricted driver's license as provided in section 6 of this act, or an ignition interlock driver's license as provided in RCW 46.20.391 and 46.20.385 unless he or she first pays to the director or other person authorized to accept applications and fees for driver's licenses a fee of $100, except as provided in subsection (2) of this section.

Upon receipt of evidence that a holder of an occupational driver's license granted under this subsection is no longer enrolled in an apprenticeship or on-the-job training program, the director shall give written notice by first‑class mail to the driver that the occupational driver's license shall be canceled. If at any time before the cancellation goes into effect the driver submits evidence of continued enrollment in the program, the cancellation shall be stayed. If the cancellation becomes effective, the driver may obtain, at no additional charge, a new occupational driver's license upon submittal of evidence of enrollment in another program that meets the criteria set forth in this subsection; and
