</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall convene an unexpected fatality review team and determine the membership of the review team.

The unexpected fatality review team shall include a representative from the health care authority, and either a representative from the office of the patient rights ombuds in cases of an unexpected fatality of a resident of a department facility that is not a residential habilitation center or state-operated living alternative, or the developmental disabilities ombuds or the ombuds' designee in cases involving an unexpected fatality of a resident of a residential habilitation center or state-operated living alternative. The department shall ensure that the unexpected fatality review team is made up of individuals who had no previous involvement in the case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The primary purpose of the unexpected fatality review shall be the development of recommendations to the department and legislature regarding changes in practices or policies to prevent fatalities and strengthen safety and health protections for residents in department facilities. The unexpected fatality review must not take precedence over investigations being conducted by adult protective services, child protective services, residential care services, or law enforcement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon conclusion of an unexpected fatality review required pursuant to this section, the department shall, within 120 days following the fatality, issue a report on the results of the review, unless an extension has been granted by the governor. Prior to issuing a report, the review team must perform an internal review for accuracy and thoroughness of the report. The report must contain a record of each review team member's vote, participation, or comment in relation to the findings and recommendations. If the report concerns a person who was the subject of one or more reports of abuse or neglect within the last year, the report must also describe the nature of any abuse or neglect reports. Completed reports must be distributed to the appropriate committees of the legislature, and the department shall create a public website where all unexpected fatality review reports required under this section must be posted and maintained. An unexpected fatality review report completed pursuant to this section is subject to public disclosure and must be posted on the public website, except that confidential information must be redacted by the department consistent with the requirements of applicable state and federal laws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within 10 days of completion of an unexpected fatality review under this section, the department shall develop an associated corrective action plan to address any concerns and implement any recommendations made by the review team in the unexpected fatality review report. Corrective action plans shall be implemented within 120 days, unless an extension has been granted by the governor. Corrective action plans are subject to public disclosure, and must be posted on the department's website in accordance with (d) of this subsection, except that confidential information must be redacted by the department consistent with the requirements of applicable state and federal laws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall develop and implement procedures to carry out the requirements of this section.</p>

<li>
<p>Documents prepared by or for an unexpected fatality review team are inadmissible and may not be used in a civil or administrative proceeding, except that any document that exists before its use or consideration in an unexpected fatality review, or that is created independently of such review, does not become inadmissible merely because it is reviewed or used by an unexpected fatality review team. A person is not unavailable as a witness merely because the person has been interviewed by, or has provided a statement for, an unexpected fatality review, but if the person is called as a witness, the person may not be examined regarding the person's interactions with the unexpected fatality review including, without limitation, whether the person was interviewed during such review, the questions that were asked during such review, and the answers that the person provided during such review. This section may not be construed as restricting the person from testifying fully in any proceeding regarding his or her knowledge of the incident under review.</p>
