# HB 2493 - Crime victims & witnesses

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2493.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that over 500,000 women in the United States are at risk of or have undergone female genital mutilation, including 25,000 women and girls in Washington state. The legislature further finds that the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metro is among the five highest rates of impacted and at-risk communities in the United States, making addressing female genital mutilation and other sexual violence critical.

It is the intent of the legislature to expand the rights of survivors of sexual assault to survivors of all acts of sexual violence, including female genital mutilation. The legislature further intends to extend the life cycle of the SAFE advisory group and expand its duties to include researching and making recommendations on trauma-informed, culturally sensitive policies to prevent and address female genital mutilation and other acts of sexual violence.

## Section 2
1. In any case involving sexual assault or domestic violence in which the defendant is proceeding pro se, at the request of the prosecutor or plaintiff, the court may appoint a representative of the pro se defendant solely for the purpose of conducting the direct questioning of the victim or survivor during trial preparation and at trial.

2. The court-appointed representative may ask only those questions submitted by the pro se defendant. The court will permit reasonable recesses to allow the pro se defendant to submit written follow-up questions to the court-appointed representative, ensuring the defendant retains full rights to examination of the witness.
