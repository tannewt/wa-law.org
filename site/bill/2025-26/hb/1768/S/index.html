<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that manufactured housing plays a key role in the availability of affordable homeownership opportunities in Washington state. The legislature also finds that it has taken steps to help preserve the availability and affordability of rental lots for manufactured homeowners, who are often senior or low-income households. However, the legislature further finds that acquisition of local manufactured housing communities by large investment and business entities is driving local landlords out of business while displacing homeowners with significant increases in rent and fees. Therefore, the legislature intends to prohibit large investment and business entities from purchasing more of the state's existing manufactured housing communities so that our state's residents and families can afford to buy and live in manufactured homes in existing communities.</p>

Sec. 101, an enhanced penalty of $5,000 shall apply.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this section the superior court issuing any injunction shall retain jurisdiction, and the cause shall be continued, and in such cases the attorney general acting in the name of the state may petition for the recovery of civil penalties.</p>
