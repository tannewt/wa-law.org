<p>Beginning January 1, 2025, a person may not practice music therapy or use any title or designation of &quot;music therapist&quot; that indicates that the person is authorized to practice music therapy unless the person is licensed under this chapter .</p>

<li>
<p>Nothing in this chapter may be construed to prohibit or restrict the practices, services, or activities of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Any person licensed, certified, or regulated under the laws of Washington state in another profession or occupation or personnel supervised by a licensed professional in this state performing work, including the use of music, incidental to the practice of the licensed, certified, or regulated profession or occupation, if the person does not represent that the person is a music therapist;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any person whose training and national certification attests to the individual's preparation and ability to practice the certified profession or occupation, if the person does not represent that the person is a music therapist;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any use and practice of music therapy as an integral part of a program of study for students enrolled in a music therapy education program; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any applicant for a license to practice music therapy providing music therapy under the supervision of a licensed music therapist for a period not to exceed six months from the start of practice if the applicant's application meets all of the requirements for licensure established in RCW 18.233.030, except the results of the examination required by RCW 18.233.030 have not been verified by the department.</p>
