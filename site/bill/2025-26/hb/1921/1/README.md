# HB 1921 - Transportation revenue

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1921.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature recognizes that sufficient funding for the transportation system is essential to ensuring that it meets the mobility needs of residents of Washington. Transportation funding needs are currently met through a variety of revenue-generating funding mechanisms, including fuel taxes, vehicle licensing fees, and other registration fees. While the fuel tax bears a relationship to use of the roadways, it also varies based on the fuel economy of a vehicle. The legislature believes that a more direct road usage-based funding method would more fairly and accurately correspond to motor vehicle use of public roads. The legislature also recognizes that the state's roadways are part of the state's integrated transportation system, and that all elements of the transportation system are necessary to sustain the system as a whole and to foster mobility throughout the state.

2. The legislature finds that a fair and equitable means of funding the statewide transportation system in the long term is needed to serve the transportation needs of the state. As vehicles become more fuel efficient and this impacts state fuel tax revenue, which has historically funded the construction, preservation, maintenance, and operations of the state highway system and the state ferry system, a reliable source of 18th amendment protected funds is needed to offset reductions in fuel tax revenue. At the same time, the legislature recognizes that support for a range of transportation modes can help mitigate the demands placed on the roadway system and that establishing a source of transportation revenue to support these modes can further the longstanding and growing need for an additional revenue source to help offset demands on a heavily utilized state highway system by funding critical rail, bicycle, pedestrian, and public transportation needs.

3. It is, therefore, the legislature's intent to establish a road usage licensing fee for preservation and maintenance highway purposes that imposes a per mile fee for the use of public roads and that is phased in over time using a rate to maintain the same net level of revenue as the fuel tax rate generates today. It is also the legislature's intent to establish a road use assessment on the use of public roadways that can be collected alongside a road usage fee to, in combination, provide support to all elements of the state's transportation system, thereby ensuring that the system is able to meet the demands being placed upon it.

4. The legislature further finds and declares that the road usage charge system must protect individuals' privacy and civil liberties. Experience in states that collect road usage charges, in addition to the research and year long test of road usage charging in Washington, demonstrates that mileage-based charges can be implemented in a manner that ensures data security and protects the privacy of motor vehicle owners. The legislature intends that the road usage charge system authorized in this act be designed and implemented in a manner that places privacy of the motor vehicle owner as a first principle, especially with regard to location data.

2. Proceeds from the per mile fee imposed under sections 2 and 3 of this act are motor vehicle license fees that must be used for preservation and maintenance highway purposes and must be deposited in the road usage charge highway account created in section 23 of this act.

## Section 5
All moneys that have accrued or may accrue in the road usage charge highway account created in section 23 of this act first must be expended for purposes enumerated in subsections (1) and (2) of this section. Beginning July 1, 2029, the remaining net fee amount must be distributed monthly by the state treasurer on a pro rata basis according to the manner in which fuel taxes imposed under RCW 46.68.090 (2) through (7) are distributed:

1. For payment of refunds of road usage charges that have been paid and are refundable as provided by law; and

2. For payment of amounts to be expended pursuant to appropriations for the administrative expenses of the offices of the state treasurer, state auditor, and department of licensing of the state of Washington in the administration of the road usage charge, which sums must be distributed monthly.

## Section 6
1. A road usage assessment for participants in the mandatory road usage charge program established in section 3 of this act is established that places an assessment on road usage fees to support a comprehensive approach to addressing demand being placed on the public roadway system. A road usage assessment shall be assessed and collected on vehicles enrolled in the mandatory road usage charge program under section 3 of this act in an amount equal to 10 percent of the total road usage fees imposed under this chapter after the application of road usage fee credits and exemptions imposed under this chapter. The department shall implement and administer the road usage assessment. For the purpose of administrative efficiency, time of collection for the road usage assessment shall be consistent with the time of collection for the road usage fee imposed under this chapter. This assessment is not a motor vehicle license fee.

2. The road usage assessment is imposed to provide funds to help manage roadway system needs through the support of a range of transportation modes that help mitigate the demands placed on the roadway system. Proceeds from the assessment on road usage imposed under this section must be used for the following multimodal transportation system purposes: Rail, bicycle, pedestrian, and public transportation. Proceeds from the assessment must be deposited in the road usage assessment account created in section 24 of this act.

Any customer fees associated with third-party automated reporting methods certified by the department may not be assumed by the department.

2. At the time of road usage fee collection under sections 2 and 3 of this act, the fee due for a vehicle participating in the road usage charge program is reduced by a fee credit in the amount of the motor vehicle fuel tax imposed under chapter 82.38 RCW that is determined by the department to correspond, either constructively or actually, to the vehicle's motor vehicle fuel usage over the period of time for which the road usage fee is being assessed. The fee credit is available solely to offset the road usage fee due based on applicable vehicle miles driven during the period of time the fee credit is earned and is nonrefundable and nontransferable to future years of program participation. The department shall adopt by rule methodologies used to determine constructive motor vehicle fuel usage by vehicles, as well as any requirements for the determination of actual fuel usage by vehicles applicable.

3. At the time of road usage fee collection under sections 2 and 3 of this act, the road usage fee due for a vehicle participating in the road usage charge program is reduced by an amount corresponding to a standard deduction of 200 miles per 12-month period, or by a proportionate share of the standard deduction applicable to the period of time for which the road usage fee is being assessed. The department shall establish by rule a process for submission of documentation for road usage charge program participants to claim a road usage fee exemption for the operation of an enrolled vehicle on roadways other than public roadways in the state in excess of the applicable standard deduction. Application for a road usage fee exemption must be made to the department in a form and manner determined by the department. The application must include any information and documentation required by the department.
