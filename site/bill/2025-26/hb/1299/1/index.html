<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that predetermined on-site parking requirements needlessly drive up the cost of development, particularly housing; discourage walking and multimodal transit usage; and encourage excessive reliance of automobiles with attendant impacts on human health and greenhouse gas emissions. The legislature further finds that the amount of parking that a project actually needs should be determined on a case-by-case basis by permit applicants sensitive to actual market conditions rather than a one-size-fits-all regulation.</p>

<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
<p>In counties and cities planning under RCW 36.70A.040, minimum residential parking requirements mandated by municipal zoning ordinances for housing units constructed after July 1, 2019, are subject to the following :</p>
<p>Cities with a population of at least 10,000 that are within a county with a population density exceeding 100 people per square mile may not require off-street parking as a condition of permitting development of multifamily, middle housing, or accessory dwelling units that are located within one-half mile walking distance of transit service. For the purposes of this section, transit service means at least one route that provides service at least four times per hour for 12 or more hours per day. Nothing in this section precludes a city from adopting maximum parking limits or requiring frontage improvements to provide on-street parking.</p>
<h2 id="section-6">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6">¶</a></h2>
<p>This act may be known and cited as the parking reform and modernization act.</p>
