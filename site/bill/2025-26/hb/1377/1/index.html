<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>This act puts in place a contingency option in the event the bid procurement to contract for the construction of the hybrid electric ferry that is to be awarded spring 2025 is unsuccessful.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If Washington state ferries fails to award a contract to a qualified contractor to build the hybrid electric ferry designed by Washington state ferries in the spring of 2025, the legislature is providing this pathway for the governor to declare an emergency with regard to ferry procurement and exercise the gubernatorial powers authorized under chapters 38.52 and 43.06 RCW to take all the necessary actions to expedite permitting and conduct an emergency procurement to acquire at least two nonhybrid electric ferries with the goal of delivery in two years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may use the existing design for the Olympic class vessels to eliminate the need for additional design work and realize the benefits of a fleet of interchangeable vessels, or the department may procure and use a vessel design that is easily adaptable or compatible with existing ferry infrastructure, can be built expeditiously, will provide the necessary service, and can be purchased within the budgeted amount for ferry vessel procurement. The procurement shall also include a preference that all warranty work on the vessels be performed within the boundaries of the state of Washington, insofar as practicable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department is directed to immediately take all the necessary actions to expedite permitting and conduct an emergency procurement to acquire nonhybrid electric vessels for expedited delivery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may postpone the conversion of the second and third jumbo mark II vessels to hybrid electric vessels until the first conversion is complete and has been proven to be effective so as not to exacerbate service problems or the department may choose not to convert the third jumbo mark II vessel and advance its mid-life maintenance to facilitate having an operational ferry for less cost and in a more timely manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provisions in this section will supersede and replace the requirements in RCW 47.60.826 and any executive order that conflicts with this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Except as permitted under chapter 47.29 or 47.46 RCW:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise delegated, and subject to RCW 47.56.820, the department of transportation shall have full charge of the planning, analysis, and construction of all toll bridges and other toll facilities including the Washington state ferries, and the operation and maintenance thereof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The transportation commission shall determine and establish the tolls and charges thereon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise delegated, and subject to RCW 47.56.820, the department shall have full charge of planning, analysis, and design of all toll facilities. The department may conduct the planning, analysis, and design of toll facilities as necessary to support the legislature's consideration of toll authorization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall utilize and administer toll collection systems that are simple, unified, and interoperable. To the extent practicable, the department shall avoid the use of toll booths. The department shall set the statewide standards and protocols for all toll facilities within the state, including those authorized by local authorities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in this section, the department shall proceed with the construction of  toll bridges and other facilities including Washington state ferries and the approaches thereto by contract in the manner of state highway construction immediately upon there being made available funds for such work and shall prosecute such work to completion as rapidly as practicable. The department is authorized to negotiate contracts for any amount without bid under (e)(i) , (ii), and (iii) of this subsection:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Emergency contracts, in order to make repairs to ferries or ferry terminal facilities or removal of such facilities whenever continued use of ferries or ferry terminal facilities constitutes a real or immediate danger to the traveling public or precludes prudent use of such ferries or facilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Single source contracts for vessel dry dockings, when there is clearly and legitimately only one available bidder to conduct dry dock-related work for a specific class or classes of vessels. The contracts may be entered into for a single vessel dry docking or for multiple vessel dry dockings for a period not to exceed two years; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emergency contracts, in order to construct new vessels in the case of an emergency declared by the governor under section 2 of this act and for mid-life maintenance on the jumbo mark II vessels.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any new vessel planning, construction, purchase, analysis, or design work must be consistent with RCW 47.60.810, except as otherwise provided in RCW 47.60.826 and section 2 of this act.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall proceed with the procurement of materials, supplies, services, and equipment needed for the support, maintenance, and use of a ferry, ferry terminal, or other facility operated by Washington state ferries, in accordance with chapter 43.19 RCW except as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>When the secretary of the department of transportation determines in writing that the use of invitation for bid is either not practicable or not advantageous to the state and it may be necessary to make competitive evaluations, including technical or performance evaluations among acceptable proposals to complete the contract award, a contract may be entered into by use of a competitive sealed proposals method, and a formal request for proposals solicitation. Such formal request for proposals solicitation shall include a functional description of the needs and requirements of the state and the significant factors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When purchases are made through a formal request for proposals solicitation the contract shall be awarded to the responsible proposer whose competitive sealed proposal is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the state taking into consideration price and other evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals. No significant factors may be used in evaluating a proposal that are not specified in the request for proposals. Factors that may be considered in evaluating proposals include but are not limited to: Price; maintainability; reliability; commonality; performance levels; life-cycle cost if applicable under this section; cost of transportation or delivery; delivery schedule offered; installation cost; cost of spare parts; availability of parts and service offered; and the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The ability, capacity, and skill of the proposer to perform the contract or provide the service required;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience, and efficiency of the proposer;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the proposer can perform the contract within the time specified;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The quality of performance of previous contracts or services;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The previous and existing compliance by the proposer with laws relating to the contract or services;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="i" start="6">
<li>
<p>Objective, measurable criteria defined in the request for proposal. These criteria may include, but are not limited to, items such as discounts, delivery costs, maintenance services costs, installation costs, and transportation costs; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such other information as may be secured having a bearing on the decision to award the contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When purchases are made through a request for proposal process, proposals received shall be evaluated based on the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposal. When issuing a request for proposal for the procurement of propulsion equipment or systems that include an engine, the request for proposal must specify the use of a life-cycle cost analysis that includes an evaluation of fuel efficiency. When a life-cycle cost analysis is used, the life-cycle cost of a proposal shall be given at least the same relative importance as the initial price element specified in the request of proposal documents. The department may reject any and all proposals received. If the proposals are not rejected, the award shall be made to the proposer whose proposal is most advantageous to the department, considering price and the other evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposal.</p>

<li>
<p>The commission shall impose a vessel replacement surcharge of 25 cents on every one-way and round-trip ferry fare sold, including multiride and monthly pass fares. This surcharge must be clearly indicated to ferry passengers and drivers and, if possible, on the fare media itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (10) of this section, beginning May 1, 2020, the commission shall impose an additional vessel replacement surcharge in an amount sufficient to fund 25 year debt service on one 144-auto hybrid vessel taking into account funds provided in chapter 417, Laws of 2019 or chapter . . . (SSB 5419), Laws of 2019 or vessels acquired pursuant to section 2 of this act. The department of transportation shall provide to the commission vessel and debt service cost estimates. Information on vessels constructed or purchased with revenue from the surcharges must be publicly posted including, but not limited to, the commission website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vessel replacement surcharges imposed in this section may only be used for the construction or purchase of ferry vessels and to pay the principal and interest on bonds authorized for the construction or purchase of new ferry vessels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall not impose the additional vessel replacement surcharge in subsection (8) of this section if doing so would increase fares by more than 10 percent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the 2023-2025 fiscal biennium, any ferry fuel surcharge imposed by the commission may not go into effect until after the ensuing regular legislative session. If a fuel surcharge is imposed as provided under this subsection, the commission must reevaluate the need for the surcharge on at least a quarterly basis to determine if the surcharge is still needed to cover increased fuel costs, and revoke the surcharge if the determination is that the surcharge is no longer needed for this purpose.</p>
