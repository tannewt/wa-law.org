        i. At the time the notice would have been required, the employer was actively seeking capital or business;

The unforeseeable business circumstances must be caused by a sudden, dramatic, and unexpected action or condition outside of the employer's control;

    e. The affected employees are employed in agricultural labor and were hired with the understanding, confirmed in writing at the time of hire, that their employment was limited to the duration of a specific agricultural season or harvest period, and the estimated end date of employment was disclosed in advance based on the anticipated completion of harvest or related seasonal activities.

2. If an exception under this section applies for only part of the 60-day notice window, notice is required at the time the exception no longer applies. If notice is not provided, the employer is liable for each day notice is not provided pursuant to RCW 49.45.040 and 49.45.050.

3. The department may not determine an exception under this section applies unless the employer meets the documentation and other requirements established by the department pursuant to RCW 49.45.070.
