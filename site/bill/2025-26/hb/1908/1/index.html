<p>Residential habilitation centers, also known as &quot;RHCs,&quot; like the Yakima Valley School, Rainier School, Lakeland Village, and Fircrest School provide services to some of our state's most vulnerable individuals and their families. Washington state, like much of our country, has a mental and behavioral health care crisis that is causing increased rates of homelessness and substance abuse. Existing resident and respite care RHCs in our state that are both well run and well respected by the individuals, families, and communities they serve are being underutilized. Opening these facilities to new residents will provide immediate and effective relief to dozens of developmentally disabled individuals and their families who have no other viable and cost reasonable options for care.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>The following residential habilitation centers are permanently established to provide services to persons with developmental disabilities: Lakeland Village, located at Medical Lake, Spokane county; Rainier School, located at Buckley, Pierce county; Yakima Valley School, located at Selah, Yakima county; and Fircrest School, located at Seattle, King county.</p>
