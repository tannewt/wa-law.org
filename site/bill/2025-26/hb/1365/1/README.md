## Section 1
1. A manufactured/mobile home rental assistance program is created to assist low-income tenants of mobile homes or manufactured housing with maintaining an affordable level of rental payments for a mobile home lot. The manufactured/mobile home rental assistance program is administered by the department under the authority of RCW 59.22.050. The department may adopt administrative rules to implement this program.

2. Under no circumstances may the department use amounts from the fund established under RCW 59.21.050 to provide the monetary rental assistance authorized in section 2 of this act.

## Section 2
1. On a monthly basis, the department may give a tenant monetary rental assistance for the purpose of assisting the tenant in the payment of rent for a mobile home lot.

2. Rental assistance may not exceed the lesser of $200 or 50 percent of the monthly rent for the mobile home lot.

## Section 3
1. A tenant may apply to the department to receive monetary rental assistance. The department shall consider the following factors in determining the eligibility of applicants to receive monetary rental assistance, and the amount of that assistance:

2. Once a tenant is approved for monetary rental assistance, the tenant is entitled to such assistance on a monthly basis for one year, unless a change in circumstance occurs earlier that requires an adjustment or termination of such assistance. The tenant is required to notify the department of any change in circumstance, including a change in household income that impacts the tenant's low-income status, or a change in monthly rent for the mobile home lot. In the case of change in circumstance, the department shall adjust or terminate the amount of the monthly monetary rental assistance as appropriate.
