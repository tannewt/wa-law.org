## Section 1
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Bird" includes, but is not limited to, any species of domestic poultry including chicken, turkey, goose, or duck.

2. "Foie gras" means the liver of a bird that has been specifically fed to produce a large, fatty liver.

3. "Force-feeding" means any process, whether implemented by hand or machine, of feeding a bird that causes the bird to ingest more food than a typical bird of the same species would consume voluntarily. Force-feeding methods include, but are not limited to, delivering feed through a tube or other device inserted into the bird's esophagus.

4. "Person" includes, but is not limited to, individuals, partnerships, corporations, associations, and retail and restaurant establishments.

## Section 2
A person may not force-feed a bird, or hire another person to force-feed a bird, for the purposes of enlarging the bird's liver beyond normal size. This section does not apply if a person force-feeds a bird as directed by a veterinarian for the purpose of improving the bird's health.

## Section 3
A person may not knowingly sell, possess, transport, or distribute any foie gras or any product containing foie gras that has been produced using the practice of force-feeding.

A person violating this chapter is subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for each violation, and up to $1,000 per day each day the violation continues. Moneys collected under this section must be deposited into the state general fund.
