<p>If the persons  entitled as set forth in this section shall fail for more than 60 days after the death of the decedent to present a petition for letters of administration, or if it appears to the satisfaction of the court that there is no next of kin, as above specified eligible to appointment, or they waive their right, and there are no principal creditor or creditors, or such creditor or creditors waive their right, then the court may appoint a contract service provider with the office of public guardianship and conservatorship under chapter 2.72 RCW or a guardian ad litem to administer such estate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the persons entitled as set forth in this section shall fail for more than 90 days after the death of the decedent to present a petition for letters of administration, then the court may appoint any suitable person to administer such estate. Such person shall receive only such compensation in connection with administration of the estate as is provided under RCW 11.48.210, and shall not purchase, acquire, or receive proceeds from the sale of estate assets except as provided under RCW 11.48.020. Unless such person is an entity described under RCW 11.36.010 (2) or (3), such person (a) shall be ineligible to receive nonintervention powers, and (b) shall be limited to two petitions for appointment under this subsection per year.</p>

<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<p>When the terms of the decedent's will manifest an intent that the personal representative appointed to administer the estate shall not be required to furnish bond or other security, or when the personal representative is the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner of the decedent and it appears to the court that the entire estate, after provision for expenses and claims of creditors, will be distributable to such spouse or surviving domestic partner, then such personal representative shall not be required to give bond or other security as a condition of appointment. In all cases where a bank or trust company authorized to act as personal representative is appointed as personal representative, no bond shall be required. In all cases where a personal representative is appointed under RCW 11.28.120(3) and is not an entity described under RCW 11.36.010 (2) or (3), bond shall be required in an amount commensurate with the major probate assets identified under RCW 11.28.110(1)(d). In all other cases, unless waived by the court, the personal representative shall give such bond or other security, in such amount and with such surety or sureties, as the court may direct.</p>
<p>Every person required to furnish bond must, before receiving letters testamentary or of administration, execute a bond to the state of Washington conditioned that the personal representative shall faithfully execute the duty of the trust according to law.</p>
<p>The court may at any time after appointment of the personal representative require said personal representative to give a bond or additional bond, the same to be conditioned and to be approved as provided in this section; or the court may allow a reduction of the bond upon a proper showing.</p>
<p>In lieu of bond, the court may in its discretion, substitute other security or financial arrangements, such as provided under RCW 11.130.445, or as the court may deem adequate to protect the assets of the estate.</p>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>

<li>
<p>Within 20 days after appointment, the personal representative of the estate of a decedent shall cause written notice of his or her appointment and the pendency of said probate proceedings, to be served personally or by mail to each heir, legatee and devisee of the estate and each beneficiary or transferee of a nonprobate asset of the decedent whose names and addresses are reasonably known to him or her. If a trust is a legatee or devisee of the estate or a beneficiary or transferee of a nonprobate asset of the decedent, then notice to the trustee is sufficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the personal representative does not otherwise give notice to creditors under chapter 11.40 RCW within 30 days after appointment, the personal representative shall cause written notice of his or her appointment and the pendency of the probate proceedings to be mailed to the state of Washington department of social and health services' office of financial recovery, and proof of the mailing shall be made by affidavit and filed in the cause.</p>

<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The following persons are not qualified to act as personal representatives:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Corporations, limited liability companies, and limited liability partnerships, except as provided in subsections (2) through (4) of this section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minors;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persons of unsound mind;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persons who have had letters testamentary or of administration revoked within the last 24 months;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persons who have been found by a court or administrative agency within the last 36 months of engaging in acts of dishonesty, theft, or breach of fiduciary duty;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persons who have been convicted of  any felony or  any crime involving moral turpitude; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persons seeking appointment under RCW 11.28.120(3) who are a principal or agent of, or acting at the behest of or in concert with, any person or entity likely to be involved in the sale, purchase, repair, or transfer of a major probate asset.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trust companies regularly organized under the laws of this state and national banks when authorized so to do may act as the personal representative of an individual's estate or of the estate of an incapacitated person upon petition of any person having a right to such appointment and may act as personal representatives or guardians when so appointed by will. No trust company or national bank may qualify as such personal representative or guardian under any will hereafter drawn by it or its agents or employees, and no salaried attorney of any such company may be allowed any attorney fee for probating any such will or in relation to the administration or settlement of any such estate, and no part of any attorney fee may inure, directly or indirectly, to the benefit of any trust company or national bank.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Professional service corporations, professional limited liability companies, or limited liability partnerships, that are duly organized under the laws of this state and whose shareholders, members, or partners, respectively, are exclusively attorneys, may act as personal representatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any nonprofit corporation may act as personal representative if the articles of incorporation or bylaws of that corporation permit the action and the corporation is in compliance with all applicable provisions of Title 24 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When any person to whom letters testamentary or of administration have been issued becomes disqualified to act because of becoming of unsound mind or receiving an adverse adjudication described in subsection (1) of this section, the court having jurisdiction must revoke his or her letters. When it appears to the satisfaction of the court, upon motion of the court or any interested person, that a person to whom letters of administration were issued under RCW 11.28.120(3) is acting as a principal or agent of a person or entity involved in the sale, purchase, repair, or transfer of a major probate asset, whether such asset was identified under RCW 11.28.110(1)(d) or identified subsequently, the court having jurisdiction must revoke his or her letters and may impose sanctions against him or her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A nonresident may be appointed to act as personal representative if the nonresident appoints an agent who is a resident of the county where such estate is being probated or who is an attorney of record of the estate, upon whom service of all papers may be made; such appointment to be made in writing and filed by the clerk with other papers of such estate; and, unless bond has been waived as provided by RCW 11.28.185, such nonresident personal representative must file a bond to be approved by the court.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-6">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Every personal representative shall, after having qualified or been appointed, by giving bond as hereinbefore provided, have a right to the immediate possession of all the real as well as personal estate of the deceased, and may receive the rents and profits of the real estate until the estate shall be settled or delivered over, by order of the court, to the heirs or devisees, and shall keep in tenantable repair all houses, buildings and fixtures thereon, which are under his or her control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless approved by the court, a personal representative appointed under RCW 11.28.120(3) may not: (a) Purchase or acquire for his or her own account or personal interest any estate asset; or (b) receive for his or her own account or personal interest any proceeds from the sale of an estate asset. Such personal representative requesting approval to purchase or acquire such asset or receive such proceeds shall petition the court and provide 14 days' notice of the hearing to the heirs, legatees, devisees, beneficiaries, and transferees of the estate. The petition shall be denied unless the personal representative establishes clearly and convincingly that the requested purchase, acquisition, or receipt is consistent with the personal representative's duty of loyalty and all applicable laws, and would not be voidable by any heir, legatee, devisee, beneficiary, or transferee of the estate. Such personal representative who violates or attempts to violate (a) or (b) of this subsection may be sanctioned by the court up to three times the value of the relevant asset or proceeds, in addition to any other sanction or remedy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-7">Section 7 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7">¶</a></h2>
<p>If testator by will makes provision for the compensation of his or her personal representative, that shall be taken as his or her full compensation unless he or she files in the court a written instrument renouncing all claim for the compensation provided by the will before qualifying as personal representative. The personal representative, when no compensation is provided in the will,  when he or she renounces all claim to the compensation provided in the will, or when he or she administers an intestate estate, shall be allowed such compensation for his or her services as the court shall deem just and reasonable. Additional compensation may be allowed for his or her services as attorney and for other services not required of a personal representative. An attorney performing services for the estate at the instance of the personal representative shall have such compensation therefore out of the estate as the court shall deem just and reasonable. Such compensation may be allowed at the final account; but at any time during administration a personal representative or his or her attorney may apply to the court for an allowance upon the compensation of the personal representative and upon attorney's fees. A personal representative appointed under RCW 11.28.120(3) shall receive no compensation in connection with administration of the estate from any person or entity other than the estate unless allowed by the court. If the court finds that the personal representative has failed to discharge his or her duties as such in any respect, it may deny him or her any compensation whatsoever or may reduce the compensation which would otherwise be allowed.</p>
<h2 id="section-8">Section 8 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-8">¶</a></h2>
<p>Whenever it shall appear to the satisfaction of the court that any portion or all of the real property should be sold, mortgaged or leased for the purpose of raising money to pay the debts and obligations of the estate, and the expenses of administration, estate taxes, or for the support of the family, to make distribution, or for such other purposes as the court may deem right and proper, the court may order the sale, lease or mortgage of such portion of the property as appears to the court necessary for the purpose aforesaid. It shall be the duty of the personal representative to present a petition to the court giving a description of all the property of the estate and its character, the amount of the debts, expenses and obligations of the estate and such other things as will tend to assist the court in determining the necessity for the sale, lease or mortgage and the amount thereof. Unless the court shall by order expressly so provide, no notice of the hearing of such petition for sale, lease or mortgage need be given, except as provided in RCW 11.28.240 and 11.48.020 hereof; if, however, the court should order notice of such hearing, it shall determine upon the kind, character and time thereof. At the hearing of such petition the court may have brought before it such testimony or information as it may see fit to receive, for the purpose of determining whether it should order any of the property of the estate sold, leased or mortgaged. The absence of any allegation in the petition shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction to order said sale, lease or mortgage, and the court may, if it see fit, order such sale, lease or mortgage without any petition having been previously presented.</p>
<h2 id="section-9">Section 9 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A personal representative may petition the court for nonintervention powers, whether the decedent died testate or intestate. However, a personal representative who is appointed under RCW 11.28.120(3) and who is not an entity described under RCW 11.36.010 (2) or (3) may not petition the court for nonintervention powers and may not be granted nonintervention powers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless the decedent has specified in the decedent's will, if any, that the court not grant nonintervention powers to the personal representative, the court shall grant nonintervention powers to a personal representative who petitions for the powers if the court determines that the decedent's estate is solvent, taking into account probate and nonprobate assets, and that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The petitioning personal representative was named in the decedent's probated will as the personal representative;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The decedent died intestate, the petitioning personal representative is the decedent's surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner, the decedent's estate is composed of community property only, and the decedent had no issue: (i) Who is living or in gestation on the date of the petition; (ii) whose identity is reasonably ascertainable on the date of the petition; and (iii) who is not also the issue of the petitioning spouse or petitioning domestic partner; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The personal representative was not a creditor of the decedent at the time of the decedent's death and the administration and settlement of the decedent's will or estate with nonintervention powers would be in the best interests of the decedent's beneficiaries and creditors. However, the administration and settlement of the decedent's will or estate with nonintervention powers will be presumed to be in the beneficiaries' and creditors' best interest until a person entitled to notice under RCW 11.68.041 rebuts that presumption by coming forward with evidence that the grant of nonintervention powers would not be in the beneficiaries' or creditors' best interests.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court may base its findings of facts necessary for the grant of nonintervention powers on: (a) Statements of witnesses appearing before the court; (b) representations contained in a verified petition for nonintervention powers, in an inventory made and returned upon oath into the court, or in an affidavit filed with the court; or (c) other proof submitted to the court.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-10">Section 10 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-10">¶</a></h2>

<li>Not later than 30 days after the date of appointment, the personal representative shall make, verify by his or her oath, and file with the clerk of the court a report confirming notice to third parties. The report shall contain the names and addresses of each heir, legatee, devisee, beneficiary, and transferee to which the personal representative provided notice of their appointment and pendency of the probate in accordance with RCW 11.28.237, the details of the personal representative's search to identify such persons, and the date and manner in which notice was provided.

If the personal representative has been discharged without having legally closed the estate, without having legally obtained an adjudication as to the heirs, or without having legally procured a decree of distribution or final settlement the court may in its discretion upon petition of any person interested, cause all such steps to be taken in such estate as were omitted or defective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless the estate is closed earlier, the court may presume that the estate is ready to be closed 24 months after the personal representative's date of appointment. If the personal representative has not submitted his or her final report and petition for distribution within 24 months of appointment, upon request of the court or any interested person, the court shall order that the final report and petition for distribution be submitted by a date certain, which date may only be moved upon a showing of good cause. Such report shall be submitted by the personal representative and enforced by the court in the manner described in RCW 11.76.010 (4) and (5).</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court on its own motion, or on the motion of the personal representative or other interested person, may inquire into the circumstances surrounding the agreement to purchase the beneficial interest to determine that the requirements of this section have been satisfied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court may refuse to order distribution under the agreement, or may order distribution of assets on any terms that the court considers just and proper, if the court finds any of the following:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">

<p>The agreement to purchase the beneficial interest was obtained by fraud, duress, or undue influence, or contained unconscionable terms at the time of transfer;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this subsection (8)(b), there shall be a rebuttable presumption that a purchase of a beneficial interest offered, negotiated, or agreed to within 120 days of the decedent's death was obtained by undue influence;</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to purchasing the beneficiary's interest in the estate, the transferee for value, or a principal or agent of, or person acting at the behest of or in concert with, the transferee for value, also purchased a major probate asset of the estate, whether such asset was identified under RCW 11.28.110(1)(d) or identified subsequently, for substantially less than fair market value; or</p>

<p>For a willful violation of the requirements of this section, the court may order the transferee for value to pay to the beneficiary up to three times the value of the assignment, in addition to any other sanction or remedy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notice of any motion brought under this section shall be served on the beneficiary and on the transferee for value at least 14 days prior to the hearing.</p>
</li>
