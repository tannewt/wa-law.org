<p>In 2021, the legislature passed Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill No. 1310 (chapter 324, Laws of 2021), with the intent of establishing a uniform statewide standard for use of force by peace officers. In 2022, the legislature passed Engrossed Substitute House Bill No. 2037 (chapter 80, Laws of 2022), with the intent of providing further clarification and guidance to police agencies and the public. However, since these provisions were enacted, the complexities and nuances of police practices and applicable laws, both in statute and common law, have posed implementation challenges for some police agencies and peace officers.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to provide clarification and guidance to police agencies and the public by codifying an objective reasonableness standard for evaluating the use of force by peace officers, based on the United States supreme court decision in Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386 (1989). This standard reflects national best practices developed and supported by police leaders across the nation. Moreover, this standard strikes the appropriate balance between the safety and rights of the public and the peace officers who serve to protect us, and the right of the people to be secure in their persons against unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>
