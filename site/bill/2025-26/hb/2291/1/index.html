<p>Application for such licenses must be made through the business licensing system under chapter 19.02 RCW. The board may refuse to issue any license under this chapter if the board has reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has willfully withheld information requested for the purpose of determining the eligibility of the applicant to receive a license, or if the board has reasonable cause to believe that information submitted in the application is false or misleading or is not made in good faith. In addition, for the purpose of reviewing an application for a license, and for considering the denial, suspension, or revocation of any such license, the board may consider criminal conduct of the applicant, including an administrative violation history record with the board and a criminal history record information check within the previous five years, in any state, tribal, or federal jurisdiction in the United States, its territories, or possessions, and the provisions of RCW 9.95.240 and chapter 9.96A RCW do not apply to such cases.

If the applicant or licensee also has a license issued under chapter 66.24, 69.50, 82.24, or 82.26 RCW, the background check done under the authority of chapter 66.24, 69.50, 82.24, or 82.26 RCW satisfies the requirements of this subsection.</p>

<p>Upon a determination by the secretary of health or a local health jurisdiction that a kratom product may be injurious to human health or poses a significant risk to public health:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The board, in consultation with the department of health and local county health jurisdiction, may cause a kratom product substance or solution sample, purchased or obtained from any kratom retailer or processor licensee, to be analyzed by an analyst appointed or designated by the board;</p>

<p>If the analyzed kratom product contains an ingredient, substance, or solution present in quantities injurious to human health or posing a significant risk to public health, as determined by the secretary of health or a local health jurisdiction, the board may suspend the license of the retailer unless the retailer licensee agrees to remove the product from sale; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If upon a finding from the secretary of health or local health jurisdiction that the kratom product poses an injurious risk to public health or significant public health risk, the retailer does not remove the kratom product from sale, the secretary of health or local health officer may file an injunction in superior court prohibiting the sale or distribution of that specific kratom product substance or solution.</p>

<p>The board may adopt rules necessary to implement, administer, and enforce this chapter.</p>
<h2 id="section-28">Section 28 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-28">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There is levied and collected a kratom excise tax equal to 11 percent of the retail sales price on kratom products. This tax is separate and in addition to general state and local sales and use taxes that apply to retail sales of tangible personal property, and is not part of the total retail price to which general state and local sales and use taxes apply. The tax must be separately itemized from the state and local retail sales tax and use taxes on the sales receipt provided to the buyer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tax levied in this section must be reflected in the price list or quoted shelf price in the licensed retailer and in any advertising that includes prices for all kratom products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All revenues collected from the kratom excise tax imposed under this section must be deposited in the youth regulated substance prevention account under section 30 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tax imposed in this section must be paid by the buyer to the seller. Each seller must collect from the buyer the full amount of the tax payable on each taxable sale. The tax collected as required by this section is deemed to be held in trust by the seller until paid to the department. If any seller fails to collect the tax imposed by this section or, having collected the tax, fails to pay it as prescribed by the department, whether such failure is the result of the seller's own actions or the result of actions or conditions beyond the seller's control, the seller is personally liable to the state for the amount of the tax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature does not intend and does not authorize any person or entity to engage in activities or to conspire to engage in activities that would constitute per se violations of state and federal antitrust laws including, but not limited to, agreements among retailers as to the selling price of any goods sold.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-29">Section 29 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-29">¶</a></h2>

<h2 id="section-30">Section 30 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-30">¶</a></h2>
<p>The youth regulated substance prevention account is created in the state treasury. All receipts from the kratom excise tax established in section 28 of this act must be deposited in the account. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. The legislature must annually appropriate amounts from the account as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Twenty-five percent for administration of this chapter; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seventy-five percent for public health education, awareness, and interventions regarding regulated substances.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-31">Section 31 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-31">¶</a></h2>
<p>This chapter preempts political subdivisions from adopting or enforcing requirements for the licensure and regulation of kratom product promotions and sales at retail. No political subdivision may impose fees or license requirements on retail outlets for possessing or selling kratom products, other than general business taxes or license fees not primarily levied on such products.</p>
<h2 id="section-32">Section 32 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-32">¶</a></h2>
<p>If the federal government or any department or agency of the federal government regulates kratom, kratom extracts, including 7-hydroxymitragynine, or any derivative of the plant mitragyna speciosa, those federal regulations shall supersede and take precedence over any provision of this chapter and any rule adopted under this chapter that is contrary to the federal action.</p>
