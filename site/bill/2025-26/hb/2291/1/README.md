## Section 27
The board may adopt rules necessary to implement, administer, and enforce this chapter.

## Section 28
1. There is levied and collected a kratom excise tax equal to 11 percent of the retail sales price on kratom products. This tax is separate and in addition to general state and local sales and use taxes that apply to retail sales of tangible personal property, and is not part of the total retail price to which general state and local sales and use taxes apply. The tax must be separately itemized from the state and local retail sales tax and use taxes on the sales receipt provided to the buyer.

The tax collected as required by this section is deemed to be held in trust by the seller until paid to the department. If any seller fails to collect the tax imposed by this section or, having collected the tax, fails to pay it as prescribed by the department, whether such failure is the result of the seller's own actions or the result of actions or conditions beyond the seller's control, the seller is personally liable to the state for the amount of the tax.

5. The legislature does not intend and does not authorize any person or entity to engage in activities or to conspire to engage in activities that would constitute per se violations of state and federal antitrust laws including, but not limited to, agreements among retailers as to the selling price of any goods sold.

## Section 29
All the provisions contained in chapter 82.32 RCW not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter have full force and application with respect to taxes imposed under this chapter.

## Section 30
The youth regulated substance prevention account is created in the state treasury. All receipts from the kratom excise tax established in section 28 of this act must be deposited in the account. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. The legislature must annually appropriate amounts from the account as follows:

1. Twenty-five percent for administration of this chapter; and

2. Seventy-five percent for public health education, awareness, and interventions regarding regulated substances.

## Section 31

## Section 32
If the federal government or any department or agency of the federal government regulates kratom, kratom extracts, including 7-hydroxymitragynine, or any derivative of the plant mitragyna speciosa, those federal regulations shall supersede and take precedence over any provision of this chapter and any rule adopted under this chapter that is contrary to the federal action.
