# HB 1775 - Fur products

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1775.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that the demand for products made of animal fur has been in decline and that the fur industry represents a very small portion of Washington's economy. For example, according to the United States department of agriculture, mink pelt production decreased 15 percent from 2018 to 2019, and the value of mink pelts produced decreased 30 percent in the same time frame. In Washington, mink pelt production accounted for only 1.4 percent of total production in the United States in 2018, decreasing to less than one percent in 2019.

2. The legislature finds that there are growing concerns for the welfare of the animals used in fur farming. For instance, there are no federal or state humane slaughter laws that regulate the industry. In addition, there are significant concerns related to the environmental impact of fur farming. For these and other reasons, the legislature finds that it is in the public interest to end fur trading and farming.

3. Recognizing the harmful impacts on animals and the environment, the legislature intends to end fur farming, to provide assistance to existing farmers transitioning to other types of farming or livelihood, and to end the production and manufacture of fur products in Washington by 2026.
