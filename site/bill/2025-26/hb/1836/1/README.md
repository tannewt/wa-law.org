# HB 1836 - Local news journalism

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1836.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds and declares the following:

1. A free and diverse fourth estate was critical in the founding of our democracy and continues to be the lifeblood for a functioning democracy.

2. Every day, journalism plays an essential role in Washington and in local communities. The ability of local news organizations to continue to provide the public with critical information about their communities, including creating content that is used by others, will preserve and ensure the sustainability of local and diverse news outlets.

3. Communities without newspapers lose touch with government, business, education, and neighbors. They operate without journalists working to keep them informed, uncover truth, expose corruption, and share common goals and experiences.

4. Over the past 10 years, newspaper advertising has decreased 66 percent, and newsroom staff have declined 44 percent.

5. Ethnic media has long been a distinctive genre of journalism and communications, informing, engaging, and advocating on behalf of communities underserved by both the for-profit and not-for-profit general market media. It plays a unique role in upholding the fourth estate in our democracy by facilitating cross-racial and cross-ethnic communications to facilitate social integration, promote civic engagement, and address inequalities among all underserved communities.

6. Given the important role of ethnic media, it is critical to advance state policy that ensures their publishers continue to employ journalists able to create content. An excellent example is the historic preamble, "We Wish to Plead Our Own Cause," a document penned by the African American journalist and abolitionist Samuel Cornish in 1827. It marked a significant milestone in the history of the Black press as it highlighted the urgent need for African Americans to have their own platform to voice their grievances, advocate for their rights, and challenge racial inequality. This call to action spurred the establishment of numerous Black-owned newspapers and publications, solidifying the role of the Black press as a powerful tool for empowerment and social change, and laid the groundwork in our country for other ethnic media to plead their own cause.

7. Quality local journalism is key to sustaining civic society, strengthening communal ties, and providing information at a deeper level that national outlets cannot match.

8. 73 percent of United States adults surveyed said they have confidence in their local newspaper.

## Section 2
1. The Washington local news journalism corps program is established within the department. The director shall make grants to eligible applicants, in accordance with this section.

2. Grants made under this section shall be used to support the employment of news journalists covering civic affairs in underserved communities to deepen community understanding of complex community issues and policies.

3. Applicants eligible for grants under this chapter must meet all of the following requirements:

    a. Be an eligible news journalism provider; and

    b. Employ at least three news journalists in Washington state per quarter in the four calendar quarters prior to receiving a grant from the department.

4. If an eligible news journalism provider fails to meet eligibility requirements in subsection (3)(b) of this section solely because they only employ two news journalists working in Washington state, they may qualify for a grant if they have employed at least two news journalists in Washington state per quarter in the eight calendar quarters prior to receiving a grant from the department.

5. The dollar amount of each grant awarded to an applicant must be in an amount proportional to the hours worked by journalists employed by the applicant as reported by the applicant to the employment security department.

6. An application for a grant under this chapter must be submitted by the applicant in such form and in accordance with requirements as determined by the director.

7. An applicant selected for funding under this chapter shall provide the department information on the news coverage supported by this program. The information shall be provided in progress and final reports as requested by the department, but no less frequently than once per biennium.
