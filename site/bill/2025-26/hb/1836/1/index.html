<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds and declares the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A free and diverse fourth estate was critical in the founding of our democracy and continues to be the lifeblood for a functioning democracy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every day, journalism plays an essential role in Washington and in local communities. The ability of local news organizations to continue to provide the public with critical information about their communities, including creating content that is used by others, will preserve and ensure the sustainability of local and diverse news outlets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communities without newspapers lose touch with government, business, education, and neighbors. They operate without journalists working to keep them informed, uncover truth, expose corruption, and share common goals and experiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over the past 10 years, newspaper advertising has decreased 66 percent, and newsroom staff have declined 44 percent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ethnic media has long been a distinctive genre of journalism and communications, informing, engaging, and advocating on behalf of communities underserved by both the for-profit and not-for-profit general market media. It plays a unique role in upholding the fourth estate in our democracy by facilitating cross-racial and cross-ethnic communications to facilitate social integration, promote civic engagement, and address inequalities among all underserved communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given the important role of ethnic media, it is critical to advance state policy that ensures their publishers continue to employ journalists able to create content. An excellent example is the historic preamble, &quot;We Wish to Plead Our Own Cause,&quot; a document penned by the African American journalist and abolitionist Samuel Cornish in 1827. It marked a significant milestone in the history of the Black press as it highlighted the urgent need for African Americans to have their own platform to voice their grievances, advocate for their rights, and challenge racial inequality. This call to action spurred the establishment of numerous Black-owned newspapers and publications, solidifying the role of the Black press as a powerful tool for empowerment and social change, and laid the groundwork in our country for other ethnic media to plead their own cause.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quality local journalism is key to sustaining civic society, strengthening communal ties, and providing information at a deeper level that national outlets cannot match.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>73 percent of United States adults surveyed said they have confidence in their local newspaper.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
