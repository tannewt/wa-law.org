<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Microplastics, often small bits of synthetic fibers from clothing, are found so commonly in drinking water that studies have estimated that the average American consumes one credit card's worth of plastic every week. Microplastics have already been linked to harm to reproductive, liver, digestive, and respiratory health, in addition to harm to the marine environment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washing synthetic garments has been found to be the single largest source of microfiber and microplastic pollution in marine waters;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A single load of laundry can release up to 700,000 microplastic fibers into wastewater, many of which pass through treatment plants and end up in rivers, lakes, and oceans. These fibers can eventually make their way into drinking water sources, affecting both tap and bottled water supplies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Studies have detected microplastics in 95 percent of United States tap water samples, indicating widespread contamination;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Studies have documented that adding microplastic filters to washing machines or their discharge lines effectively reduces microplastic pollution; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filters are available commercially at relatively low cost. Costs will reduce further as other nations and states require new washing machines to include microfiber filters.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to begin reducing microplastic pollution in Washington's waters in order to protect public health and environment starting with industrial and commercial laundry facilities, which contribute a large portion of the discharges. Adding filters to commercial or industrial laundry discharge lines or newly installed machines is a relatively low cost and easily implemented step. As the incremental cost of adding filters to new consumer machines or new residential consumer installations reduces, which may be from adoption of similar standards in large consumer markets, the legislature intends for the department to adopt requirements for filters.</p>
