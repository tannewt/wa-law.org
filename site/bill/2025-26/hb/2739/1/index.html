<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature declares there is a state of emergency in scientific research activities conducted by Washington research institutions that is jeopardizing current research and the sustainability of scientific advancements for at least a generation, which in turn jeopardizes advances in human health and the economic prosperity of Washington residents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The emergency has been caused by federal agencies acting at the direction of the incumbent President of the United States and in contravention of Congressional legislation and the longstanding commitment of the United States to being the world's leader in advancing human health, technological development, and economic expansion driven by research and development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For more than half a century, through the financial support of governmental agencies including, but not limited to, the national science foundation, the national institutes of health, the department of energy, the United States food and drug administration, the federal centers for disease control and prevention, the national oceanic and atmospheric administration, and the department of war, the scientific and health communities have been able to create life-enhancing scientific, biomedical, and public health discoveries and technological advances that enhance national security and create economic prosperity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the direction of the presidential administration, those agencies have made changes that have resulted in drastic cuts to existing federal grants to research activities in Washington. The cuts have created an existential crisis in ongoing research activity. The cuts also preclude planning for future research because the cuts create uncertainty as to whether there will be sufficient funding to sustain the long timeline for experimentation and innovation needed to yield the benefits that so dramatically improve the lives of Washington citizens and beyond.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington's public research universities and colleges have lost or are projected to lose many hundreds of millions of dollars in federal research grant funding for fiscal year 2025 and many hundreds of millions of dollars more in the following year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ongoing research in Washington has been jeopardized in many fields including, but not limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Medicine, such as breast and prostate cancer prevention and treatment research;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agriculture and veterinary medicine, such as large animal research and animal-to-human disease transmission;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Climate and weather research;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technological development, vital to security and economic development, such as quantum information science and engineering and semiconductor technology;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small business innovation research and technology transfer; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applied physics research, key to our national defense.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not only will lives be lost because of the failure to fund ongoing research, but many Washington research institutions will eliminate research programs because gaps in funding created by the planned federal cuts cannot be filled with other funding and make the ongoing research unsustainable. For just one example, Washington State University's college of veterinary medicine's research is 30 percent funded by the national institutes of health. The announced cuts put in jeopardy the continued work of the college of veterinary medicine's Washington animal disease diagnostic laboratory, the only accredited veterinary medical laboratory within Washington. The laboratory's work to detect, research, and conduct responses to current and future disease outbreaks such as the current highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, rabies, tularemia, and the plague may be lost completely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The current announced cuts, and the uncertainty about future funding, have caused many research projects to cease and many more will cease or move to other countries where research funding is more sustainable. Washington will not only lose its current research capacity but will likely also lose a whole generation of scientists across a broad spectrum of research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the damage to human health, the economic consequences of the loss of Washington's currently robust research activities will create a spiraling economic downturn in the state. Currently, research-driven innovation returns to Washington's economy more than two dollars for every dollar invested. For just one example, the University of Washington's research enterprise for fiscal year 2023 contributed $2,600,000,000 to the Washington state economy and supported 10,641 jobs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The human and economic damage that is being caused and will be caused by the actions of the current federal executive administration can be mitigated by legislative action, approved by the people of Washington, to sustain ongoing and future scientific research. The health, economic welfare, and security of the people of Washington and our nation require the legislature and people to act to sustain research and innovation.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The total amount of the bonds authorized by this section issued in any single calendar year, commencing in 2027, may not exceed $1,000,000,000. If less than this amount of bonds is issued in any year, the remaining permitted amount may be carried over to one or more subsequent years.</p>
