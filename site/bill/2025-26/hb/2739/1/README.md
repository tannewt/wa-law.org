# HB 2739 - Scientific research

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2739.pdf)

## Section 101
1. The legislature declares there is a state of emergency in scientific research activities conducted by Washington research institutions that is jeopardizing current research and the sustainability of scientific advancements for at least a generation, which in turn jeopardizes advances in human health and the economic prosperity of Washington residents.

2. The emergency has been caused by federal agencies acting at the direction of the incumbent President of the United States and in contravention of Congressional legislation and the longstanding commitment of the United States to being the world's leader in advancing human health, technological development, and economic expansion driven by research and development.

3. For more than half a century, through the financial support of governmental agencies including, but not limited to, the national science foundation, the national institutes of health, the department of energy, the United States food and drug administration, the federal centers for disease control and prevention, the national oceanic and atmospheric administration, and the department of war, the scientific and health communities have been able to create life-enhancing scientific, biomedical, and public health discoveries and technological advances that enhance national security and create economic prosperity.

4. At the direction of the presidential administration, those agencies have made changes that have resulted in drastic cuts to existing federal grants to research activities in Washington. The cuts have created an existential crisis in ongoing research activity. The cuts also preclude planning for future research because the cuts create uncertainty as to whether there will be sufficient funding to sustain the long timeline for experimentation and innovation needed to yield the benefits that so dramatically improve the lives of Washington citizens and beyond.

5. Washington's public research universities and colleges have lost or are projected to lose many hundreds of millions of dollars in federal research grant funding for fiscal year 2025 and many hundreds of millions of dollars more in the following year.

6. Ongoing research in Washington has been jeopardized in many fields including, but not limited to:

    a. Medicine, such as breast and prostate cancer prevention and treatment research;

    b. Agriculture and veterinary medicine, such as large animal research and animal-to-human disease transmission;

    c. Climate and weather research;

    d. Technological development, vital to security and economic development, such as quantum information science and engineering and semiconductor technology;

    e. Small business innovation research and technology transfer; and

    f. Applied physics research, key to our national defense.

7. Not only will lives be lost because of the failure to fund ongoing research, but many Washington research institutions will eliminate research programs because gaps in funding created by the planned federal cuts cannot be filled with other funding and make the ongoing research unsustainable. For just one example, Washington State University's college of veterinary medicine's research is 30 percent funded by the national institutes of health. The announced cuts put in jeopardy the continued work of the college of veterinary medicine's Washington animal disease diagnostic laboratory, the only accredited veterinary medical laboratory within Washington. The laboratory's work to detect, research, and conduct responses to current and future disease outbreaks such as the current highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, rabies, tularemia, and the plague may be lost completely.

8. The current announced cuts, and the uncertainty about future funding, have caused many research projects to cease and many more will cease or move to other countries where research funding is more sustainable. Washington will not only lose its current research capacity but will likely also lose a whole generation of scientists across a broad spectrum of research.

9. In addition to the damage to human health, the economic consequences of the loss of Washington's currently robust research activities will create a spiraling economic downturn in the state. Currently, research-driven innovation returns to Washington's economy more than two dollars for every dollar invested. For just one example, the University of Washington's research enterprise for fiscal year 2023 contributed $2,600,000,000 to the Washington state economy and supported 10,641 jobs.

10. The human and economic damage that is being caused and will be caused by the actions of the current federal executive administration can be mitigated by legislative action, approved by the people of Washington, to sustain ongoing and future scientific research. The health, economic welfare, and security of the people of Washington and our nation require the legislature and people to act to sustain research and innovation.

## Section 201
1. The state finance committee may issue general obligation bonds of the state of Washington in the sum of $6,000,000,000, or so much thereof as may be required, solely for the purpose of providing funds to advance scientific research, as specified in section 401 of this act, and all costs incidental thereto.

2. Bonds authorized in this section may be sold in the manner, at the time or times, in amounts, and at such price as the state finance committee determines.

3. The total amount of the bonds authorized by this section issued in any single calendar year, commencing in 2027, may not exceed $1,000,000,000. If less than this amount of bonds is issued in any year, the remaining permitted amount may be carried over to one or more subsequent years.

4. The authorization to issue bonds contained in this act does not expire until the full authorization has been issued.

5. No bonds authorized in this section may be offered for sale without prior legislative appropriation of the net proceeds of the sale of the bonds.

## Section 202
It is the intent of the legislature that the proceeds of the new bonds authorized in sections 201 and 203 of this act will be appropriated for the specific uses set forth in section 403 of this act in phases over three biennia, beginning with the 2025–2027 biennium. This is not intended to limit the legislature's ability to appropriate bond proceeds if the full amount authorized in sections 201 and 203 of this act has not been appropriated after two biennia.

## Section 203
1. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds authorized in section 201 of this act must be deposited in the Washington institute for scientific advancement account created in section 301 of this act. If the state finance committee deems it necessary to issue the bonds authorized in section 201 of this act as taxable bonds in order to comply with federal internal revenue service rules and regulations pertaining to the use of nontaxable bond proceeds, the proceeds of such taxable bonds must be deposited into the Washington institute for scientific advancement taxable bond account created in section 302 of this act. The state treasurer shall submit written notice to the director of financial management if it is determined that any such transfer to the Washington institute for scientific advancement taxable bond account is necessary. If such a transfer is required, a portion of the appropriation authority granted in any omnibus capital appropriations act from the Washington institute for scientific advancement account is transferred to the Washington institute for scientific advancement taxable bond account in an amount equal to the transferred proceeds. For purposes of this section, "nontaxable bond proceeds" includes proceeds from bonds issued as tax exempt bonds and proceeds from taxable bonds eligible for direct federal subsidy or other federal tax advantage under the federal internal revenue code and internal revenue service rules.

2. The proceeds must be used exclusively for the purpose stated in section 403 of this act and for the payment of expenses incurred in the issuance and sale of the bonds.

## Section 204
1. The nondebt-limit general fund bond retirement account must be used for the payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds authorized in sections 201 and 203 of this act.

2. The state finance committee shall, on or before June 30th of each year, certify to the state treasurer the amount needed in the ensuing 12 months to meet the bond retirement and interest requirements. On each date on which any interest or principal and interest payment is due, the state treasurer shall withdraw from any general state revenues received in the state treasury and deposit in the nondebt-limit general fund bond retirement account an amount equal to the amount certified by the state finance committee to be due on the payment date.

3. Bonds issued under sections 201 and 203 of this act must state that they are a general obligation of the state of Washington, pledge the full faith and credit of the state to the payment of the principal thereof and the interest thereon, and contain an unconditional promise to pay the principal and interest as the same becomes due.

## Section 205
1. The bonds authorized by sections 201 and 203 of this act constitute a legal investment for all state funds or for funds under state control and all funds of municipal corporations.

2. The owner and holder of each of the bonds or the trustee for the owner and holder of any of the bonds may by mandamus or other appropriate proceeding require the transfer and payment of funds as directed in this section.

## Section 206
The legislature may provide additional means for raising moneys for the payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds authorized in sections 201 and 203 of this act, and sections 203 and 204 of this act do not provide an exclusive method for the payment.

## Section 301
The Washington institute for scientific advancement account is created in the state treasury. Proceeds from the bonds issued under section 201 of this act must be deposited in the account. The account must be used for the purpose stated in section 403 of this act and for payment of expenses incurred in connection with the sale and issuance of the bonds. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation.

## Section 302
The Washington institute for scientific advancement taxable account is created in the state treasury. Proceeds from any taxable bonds issued and directed to the account under section 203 of this act must be deposited in the account.
