<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>These exponential increases in state budgets have come with little benefit to the citizens of Washington state. Over the past decade, Washington state has experienced declining student test scores, fewer students attending postsecondary education, significant spikes in the number of unsheltered homeless individuals in our communities, stagnant carbon emissions, skyrocketing violent crime rates, a worsening housing shortage, severe increases in the cost of housing, steep drops in business climate, and has become one of the least affordable states for working families in the nation. Despite the multitude of promises made about increased state spending to fix these crises, this legislature has unequivocally failed to deliver on these commitments.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to reform the state budgeting process to require accountability for every taxpayer dollar spent, ensure that lawmakers prioritize spending on essential services prior to luxury spending items or tax increases, and place limitations on state spending to ensure fiscal discipline and responsibility.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>The director of financial management shall provide all agencies with a complete set of instructions for submitting biennial budget requests to the director at least three months before agency budget documents are due into the office of financial management. The budget document or documents shall consist of the governor's budget message which shall be explanatory of the budget and shall contain an outline of the proposed financial policies of the state for the ensuing fiscal period, as well as an outline of the proposed six-year financial policies where applicable, and shall describe in connection therewith the important features of the budget. The biennial budget document or documents shall also describe performance indicators that demonstrate measurable progress towards priority results. The message shall set forth the reasons for salient changes from the previous fiscal period in expenditure and revenue items and shall explain any major changes in financial policy. Attached to the budget message shall be such supporting schedules, exhibits and other explanatory material in respect to both current operations and capital improvements as the governor shall deem to be useful to the legislature. The budget document or documents shall set forth a proposal for expenditures in the ensuing fiscal period, or six-year period where applicable, based upon the estimated revenues and caseloads as approved by the economic and revenue forecast council and caseload forecast council or upon the estimated revenues and caseloads of the office of financial management for those funds, accounts, sources, and programs for which the forecast councils do not prepare an official forecast. Revenues shall be estimated for such fiscal period from the source and at the rates existing by law at the time of submission of the budget document, including the supplemental budgets submitted in the even-numbered years of a biennium. However, the estimated revenues and caseloads for use in the governor's budget document may be adjusted to reflect budgetary revenue transfers and revenue and caseload estimates dependent upon budgetary assumptions of enrollments, workloads, and caseloads. All adjustments to the approved estimated revenues and caseloads must be set forth in the budget document. The governor may additionally submit, as an appendix to each supplemental, biennial, or six-year agency budget or to the budget document or documents, a proposal for expenditures in the ensuing fiscal period from revenue sources derived from proposed changes in existing statutes.</li>
</ol>
<p>The budget document or documents shall also contain:</p>

c. Such additional information dealing with expenditures, revenues, workload, performance, and personnel as the legislature may direct by law or concurrent resolution;

d. Such additional information dealing with revenues and expenditures as the governor shall deem pertinent and useful to the legislature;

e. Tabulations showing expenditures classified by fund, function, and agency;

f. The expenditures that include nonbudgeted, nonappropriated accounts outside the state treasury;

g. Identification of all proposed direct expenditures to implement the Puget Sound water quality plan under chapter 90.71 RCW, shown by agency and in total; and

h. Tabulations showing each postretirement adjustment by retirement system established after fiscal year 1991, to include, but not be limited to, estimated total payments made to the end of the previous biennial period, estimated payments for the present biennium, and estimated payments for the ensuing biennium.
