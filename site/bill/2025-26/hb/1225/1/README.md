# HB 1225 - Budgeting process

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1225.pdf)

## Section 1
These exponential increases in state budgets have come with little benefit to the citizens of Washington state. Over the past decade, Washington state has experienced declining student test scores, fewer students attending postsecondary education, significant spikes in the number of unsheltered homeless individuals in our communities, stagnant carbon emissions, skyrocketing violent crime rates, a worsening housing shortage, severe increases in the cost of housing, steep drops in business climate, and has become one of the least affordable states for working families in the nation. Despite the multitude of promises made about increased state spending to fix these crises, this legislature has unequivocally failed to deliver on these commitments.

Therefore, the legislature intends to reform the state budgeting process to require accountability for every taxpayer dollar spent, ensure that lawmakers prioritize spending on essential services prior to luxury spending items or tax increases, and place limitations on state spending to ensure fiscal discipline and responsibility.

## Section 2
1. The director of financial management shall provide all agencies with a complete set of instructions for submitting biennial budget requests to the director at least three months before agency budget documents are due into the office of financial management. The budget document or documents shall consist of the governor's budget message which shall be explanatory of the budget and shall contain an outline of the proposed financial policies of the state for the ensuing fiscal period, as well as an outline of the proposed six-year financial policies where applicable, and shall describe in connection therewith the important features of the budget. The biennial budget document or documents shall also describe performance indicators that demonstrate measurable progress towards priority results. The message shall set forth the reasons for salient changes from the previous fiscal period in expenditure and revenue items and shall explain any major changes in financial policy. Attached to the budget message shall be such supporting schedules, exhibits and other explanatory material in respect to both current operations and capital improvements as the governor shall deem to be useful to the legislature. The budget document or documents shall set forth a proposal for expenditures in the ensuing fiscal period, or six-year period where applicable, based upon the estimated revenues and caseloads as approved by the economic and revenue forecast council and caseload forecast council or upon the estimated revenues and caseloads of the office of financial management for those funds, accounts, sources, and programs for which the forecast councils do not prepare an official forecast. Revenues shall be estimated for such fiscal period from the source and at the rates existing by law at the time of submission of the budget document, including the supplemental budgets submitted in the even-numbered years of a biennium. However, the estimated revenues and caseloads for use in the governor's budget document may be adjusted to reflect budgetary revenue transfers and revenue and caseload estimates dependent upon budgetary assumptions of enrollments, workloads, and caseloads. All adjustments to the approved estimated revenues and caseloads must be set forth in the budget document. The governor may additionally submit, as an appendix to each supplemental, biennial, or six-year agency budget or to the budget document or documents, a proposal for expenditures in the ensuing fiscal period from revenue sources derived from proposed changes in existing statutes.

The budget document or documents shall also contain:

    a. Revenues classified by fund and source for the immediately past fiscal period, those received or anticipated for the current fiscal period, and those anticipated for the ensuing biennium;

    b. The undesignated fund balance or deficit, by fund;

    c. Such additional information dealing with expenditures, revenues, workload, performance, and personnel as the legislature may direct by law or concurrent resolution;

    d. Such additional information dealing with revenues and expenditures as the governor shall deem pertinent and useful to the legislature;

    e. Tabulations showing expenditures classified by fund, function, and agency;

    f. The expenditures that include nonbudgeted, nonappropriated accounts outside the state treasury;

    g. Identification of all proposed direct expenditures to implement the Puget Sound water quality plan under chapter 90.71 RCW, shown by agency and in total; and

Tabulations showing each postretirement adjustment by retirement system established after fiscal year 1991, to include, but not be limited to, estimated total payments made to the end of the previous biennial period, estimated payments for the present biennium, and estimated payments for the ensuing biennium.

2. The budget document or documents shall include detailed estimates of all anticipated revenues applicable to proposed operating or capital expenditures and shall also include all proposed operating or capital expenditures. The total of beginning undesignated fund balance and estimated revenues less working capital and other reserves shall equal or exceed the total of proposed applicable expenditures. The budget document or documents shall further include:

    a. Interest, amortization and redemption charges on the state debt;

    b. Payments of all reliefs, judgments, and claims;

    c. Other statutory expenditures;

    d. Expenditures incident to the operation for each agency;

    e. Revenues derived from agency operations;

    f. Expenditures and revenues shall be given in comparative form showing those incurred or received for the immediately past fiscal period and those anticipated for the current biennium and next ensuing biennium;

    g. A showing and explanation of amounts of general fund and other funds obligations for debt service and any transfers of moneys that otherwise would have been available for appropriation;

    h. Common school expenditures on a fiscal-year basis;

        i. A showing, by agency, of the value and purpose of financing contracts for the lease/purchase or acquisition of personal or real property for the current and ensuing fiscal periods; and

A showing and explanation of anticipated amounts of general fund and other funds required to amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the retirement system specified under chapter 41.45 RCW, and the contributions to meet such amortization, stated in total dollars and as a level percentage of total compensation.

3. The governor's operating budget document or documents shall reflect the statewide priorities as required by RCW 43.88.090.

4. The governor's operating budget document or documents shall identify activities that are not addressing the statewide priorities.

    b. "Program" means a service or a group of services designed to accomplish a specific public goal and result in specific public benefits except for those entitlement services listed in the definition of "caseload" under RCW 43.88C.010 (7) and (12). For the zero-based budget review under this section, a program is any distinguishable service or unit that makes up an agency activity. In most cases, an agency activity will encompass several programs, although in some cases the agency activity could be one program.

    c. "Zero-based budget review" means:

        i. Information and analysis regarding an agency's programs prepared by the agency as required by subsection (3) of this section that must be included as a separate document in an agency's biennial budget request under this chapter; and

        ii. Consideration of the information provided under (c)(i) of this subsection by the governor and the legislature during the budget development process.

2. Beginning in 2026 and in each even-numbered year thereafter, the legislature must specify, in the omnibus operating appropriations act or in other legislation, programs for which agencies must perform a zero-based budget review under subsection (3) of this section. It is the intent of the legislature that 20 percent of all state programs be subject to a zero-based budget review each biennium, so that every program receives a zero-based budget review within a 10-year cycle. When selecting programs for review, the legislature may specify programs by functional area, such as education, health care, other human services, natural resources, and general government, or may specify programs as prioritized by the legislature. When selecting programs for a zero-based budget review for a particular biennium, the legislature may broaden or narrow the definition of program for specific agencies.

3. Beginning with biennial budget requests for the 2027-2029 fiscal biennium and with each biennial budget request thereafter, agencies must submit zero-based budget reviews for the programs identified by the legislature for review that biennium under subsection (2) of this section. Information and analysis submitted by agencies for the zero-based review under this section shall include:

    a. A statement of the statutory basis or other basis for the creation of each program and the history of each program that is being reviewed;

    b. A description of how each program fits within the strategic plan and goals of the agency and an analysis of the quantified objectives of each program within the agency;

    c. Any available performance measures indicating the effectiveness and efficiency of each program;

    d. A description with supporting cost and staffing data of each program and the populations served by each program, and the level of funding and staff required to accomplish the goals of the program if different than the actual maintenance level;

    e. An analysis of the major costs and benefits of operating each program and the rationale for specific expenditure and staffing levels;

    f. An analysis estimating each program's administrative and other overhead costs;

    g. An analysis of the levels of services provided;

    h. Where applicable, an analysis estimating the amount of funds or benefits that actually reach the intended recipients; and

        i. Other information and analysis requested by the legislature in the legislation identifying the agency programs for review under subsection (2) of this section.

4. [Empty]

    a. The governor and legislature shall consider the information and analysis provided by agencies under this section in the budget development process. The house of representatives appropriations committee and the senate ways and means committee shall hold at least one public hearing on the information and analysis submitted by agencies under the zero-based budget review.

    b. The information and analysis submitted by agencies under the zero-based budget review process must be filed electronically with the state's fiscal website managed by the legislative evaluation and accountability program committee.

## Section 5
1. The legislature must enact appropriations for state operating expenditures in separate, prioritized appropriations bills as required by this section.

    a. Operating appropriations must be enacted in separate bills for the following purposes:

        i. First: For payment of principal and interest on outstanding debt of the state.

        ii. Second: For basic public education of children in grades kindergarten through 12.

        iii. Third: For assessing and collecting state revenue.

        iv. Fourth: For public safety.

    v. Fifth: For public health.

    vi. Sixth: For public assistance programs.

    vii. Seventh: For all other state purposes.

    viii. Eighth: For the legislature, judiciary, and statewide elected officials in the executive branch.

    b. Operating appropriations bills must be enacted in the priority order established in (a) of this subsection. Before either house of the legislature may take a final vote on legislation that raises state taxes, it must first enact operating appropriations legislation that funds the maximum number of operating appropriations bills in priority order with revenues projected for collection under existing tax laws.

    c. To implement the requirements of this section, the legislature must assign agencies to one of the priority categories in (a) of this subsection. The legislature may divide the activities of an agency among multiple categories, but it is not required to do so.

    d. For purposes of this section, "raises state taxes" means any action by the legislature that imposes a new tax, expands a tax base, or increases an existing rate of taxation, including modifications to any tax preference, where such action increases state tax revenue deposited in any state account appropriated in state operating budget legislation.

    e. For purposes of this section, revenue projections are made by the economic and revenue forecast council as established in law, or its successor entity.

2. The legislature must enact all biennial appropriations bills for operating, transportation, and capital purposes no later than 30 days before the beginning of the fiscal biennium for which the appropriations are made.

## Section 6
This act is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, or support of the state government and its existing public institutions, and takes effect immediately.
