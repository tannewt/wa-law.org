[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2232.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature intends to:

1. Implement the recommendations of the emergency cardiac and stroke system assessment directed by chapter 58, Laws of 2022 to support efforts to improve emergency cardiac and stroke care in Washington and reduce death and disability resulting from cardiac and stroke events. This includes developing an inclusive system of optimal cardiac and stroke care throughout the continuum of care delivery. Coordinated health care delivery systems require ongoing levels of oversight, evidence-based inputs, coordination, and evaluation of performance. Accordingly, the legislature intends that the department has the responsibility for oversight and coordination of the statewide cardiac and stroke system of care; and

2. Establish a single statewide data repository for time-sensitive emergencies, including stroke events, cardiac events such as heart attack and sudden cardiac arrest, and trauma events, such as traumatic brain injury. The data repository shall be established by maintaining the existing reporting requirements under the trauma registry and adding new data sets related to stroke events and cardiac events. The result will provide a data repository that is able to analyze data on the incidence, severity, and causes of cardiac, stroke, and trauma events. In addition, the data repository will have the capacity to interact with the statewide electronic emergency medical services data system to provide complete information about the status of the time-sensitive emergency response system in Washington.

## Section 2
1.Until January 1, 2031, when the time-sensitive emergencies data repository is established under subsection (2) of this section, the department shall maintain a statewide data registry to collect and analyze data on the incidence, severity, and causes of trauma, including traumatic brain injury. The department shall collect additional data on traumatic brain injury should additional data requirements be enacted by the legislature. The registry shall be used to improve the availability and delivery of prehospital and hospital trauma care services. Specific data elements of the registry shall be defined by rule by the department. To the extent possible, the department shall coordinate data collection from hospitals for the trauma registry with the health care data system authorized in chapter 70.170 RCW. Every hospital, facility, or health care provider authorized to provide level I, II, III, IV, or V trauma care services, level I, II, or III pediatric trauma care services, level I, level I-pediatric, II, or III trauma-related rehabilitative services, and prehospital trauma-related services in the state shall furnish data to the registry. All other hospitals and prehospital providers shall furnish trauma data as required by the department by rule.

## Section 3
1. By January 1, 2011, the department shall endeavor to enhance and support an emergency cardiac and stroke care system through:

    a. Encouraging hospitals to voluntarily self-identify cardiac and stroke capabilities, indicating which level of cardiac and stroke service the facility provides. Hospital levels must be defined by the previous work of the emergency cardiac and stroke technical advisory committee and must follow the guiding principles and recommendations of the emergency cardiac and stroke work group report;

    b. Giving a hospital "deemed status" and designating it as a primary stroke center if it has received a certification of distinction for primary stroke centers issued by the nonprofit organization known as the joint commission. When available, a hospital shall demonstrate its cardiac or stroke level through external, national certifying organizations, including, but not limited to, primary stroke center certification by the joint commission; and

    c. Within the current authority of the department, adopting cardiac and stroke prehospital patient care protocols, patient care procedures, and triage tools, consistent with the guiding principles and recommendations of the emergency cardiac and stroke work group report.

2. A hospital that voluntarily participates in the system:

    a. Shall participate in internal, as well as regional, quality improvement activities;

    b. Shall participate in a national, state, or local data collection system that measures cardiac and stroke system performance from patient onset of symptoms to treatment or intervention, and includes, at a minimum, the nationally recognized consensus measures for stroke. Beginning January 1, 2031, hospitals that participate in the system shall submit data to the time-sensitive emergencies data repository; and

    c. May advertise participation in the system, but may not claim a verified certification level unless verified by an external, nationally recognized, evidence-based certifying body as provided in subsection (1)(b) of this section.
