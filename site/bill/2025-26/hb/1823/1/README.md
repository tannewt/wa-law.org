    a. Improve mobility of people and goods in Washington state by supporting economic development and environmentally responsive solutions to our statewide transportation system needs;

Within one year after board approval of an application for funding, a county, city, or transportation benefit district shall provide written certification to the board of the pledged local and/or private funding. Funds allocated to an applicant that does not certify its funding within one year after approval may be reallocated by the board.

## Section 2
Transportation improvement account projects selected for funding programs after fiscal year 1995 are governed by the requirements of this section.

The board shall allocate funds from the account by June 30th of each year for the ensuing fiscal year to urban counties, cities , and to transportation benefit districts.

Priority consideration shall be given to those projects with the greatest percentage of local or private contribution, or both.

Within one year after board approval of an application for funding, the lead agency shall provide written certification to the board of the pledged local and private funding for the phase of the project approved.
