# HB 2094 - Requiring coroners to be appointed rather than elected.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2094.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that county coroners occupy positions of significant public importance. By investigating unexpected deaths, coroners provide important public safety and public health services. Technical skill, and medical and legal investigative abilities are critical to perform this function. Coroner is not a political position, yet most counties are required to hold coroner elections.

Many coroners or medical examiners in the state are already appointed and serving successfully. Counties with less than 40,000 may appoint a coroner in lieu of electing a coroner, while those with more than 250,000 may appoint a medical examiner. Having all counties, including those in between those thresholds, appoint rather than elect a coroner will reduce taxpayer costs by removing an unnecessary elected office. Therefore, in order to better steward public funds, the legislature finds that coroners throughout the state should be appointed rather than elected.

## Section 2
1. Except as provided elsewhere in this section, in every county there shall be elected from among the qualified voters of the county a county assessor, a county auditor, a county clerk,  three county commissioners, a county prosecuting attorney, a county sheriff, and a county treasurer. A noncharter county may have five county commissioners as provided in RCW 36.32.010 and 36.32.055 through 36.32.0556.

2. Each county legislative authority must appoint a coroner. If a county has an elected coroner as of the effective date of this section, the elected coroner may continue in office until the coroner's term of office expires, at which time the county legislative authority must appoint a coroner. In a county with a population of $250,000 or more, the county legislative authority may replace the office of coroner with a medical examiner system and appoint a medical examiner as specified in RCW 36.24.190. Any county may enter into an interlocal agreement under chapter 39.34 RCW with an adjoining county for the provision of coroner or medical examiner services.

## Section 3
1. [Empty]

    a. All  coroners, persons serving as coroners, medical examiners, and all other full-time medicolegal investigative personnel employed by a county coroner's or medical examiner's office must successfully complete medicolegal forensic investigation training through the medicolegal training academy program within 12 months of being  appointed or employed unless otherwise exempted by the commission. This section does not apply to elected prosecutors who are coroners in their counties.

    b. All part-time medicolegal investigative personnel employed by a county coroner's or medical examiner's office must successfully complete medicolegal forensic investigation training through the medicolegal training academy program within 18 months of being employed unless otherwise exempted by the commission.

2. The commission, in conjunction with the Washington association of coroners and medical examiners and a practicing physician selected by the commission, shall develop the medicolegal forensic investigation training curriculum and adopt the standards for the medicolegal training academy and any exemption from the requirement to complete the medicolegal forensic investigation training. The commission shall exempt from this requirement any coroner, medical examiner, or medicolegal investigative personnel who has obtained training comparable to the medicolegal forensic investigation training by virtue of educational or professional training or experience.

3. The commission must certify successful completion of the medicolegal forensic investigation training or exemption from the medicolegal training requirement within 60 days from the receipt of proof of completion or request for exemption.

4. The medicolegal forensic investigation training required under this section must:

    a. Meet the recommendations of the national commission on forensic science for certification and accreditation; and

    b. Satisfy the requirements for training on the subject of sudden, unexplained child death including, but not limited to, sudden infant death syndrome developed pursuant to RCW 43.103.100 and missing persons protocols pursuant to RCW 43.103.110.

5. Certification under this section is a condition of continued employment in a coroner's or medical examiner's office.

6. A county in which a coroner, person serving as coroner, medical examiner, or other medicolegal investigative employee, who has not otherwise been exempted by the commission, is not certified within 12 months of being elected, appointed, or employed as required by this section, may have its reimbursement from the death investigations account reduced as provided under RCW 68.50.104 until the office is in compliance with all requirements under this section.

## Section 4
