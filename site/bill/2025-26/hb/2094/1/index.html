<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that county coroners occupy positions of significant public importance. By investigating unexpected deaths, coroners provide important public safety and public health services. Technical skill, and medical and legal investigative abilities are critical to perform this function. Coroner is not a political position, yet most counties are required to hold coroner elections.</p>
<p>Many coroners or medical examiners in the state are already appointed and serving successfully. Counties with less than 40,000 may appoint a coroner in lieu of electing a coroner, while those with more than 250,000 may appoint a medical examiner. Having all counties, including those in between those thresholds, appoint rather than elect a coroner will reduce taxpayer costs by removing an unnecessary elected office. Therefore, in order to better steward public funds, the legislature finds that coroners throughout the state should be appointed rather than elected.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Except as provided elsewhere in this section, in every county there shall be elected from among the qualified voters of the county a county assessor, a county auditor, a county clerk,  three county commissioners, a county prosecuting attorney, a county sheriff, and a county treasurer. A noncharter county may have five county commissioners as provided in RCW 36.32.010 and 36.32.055 through 36.32.0556.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each county legislative authority must appoint a coroner. If a county has an elected coroner as of the effective date of this section, the elected coroner may continue in office until the coroner's term of office expires, at which time the county legislative authority must appoint a coroner. In a county with a population of $250,000 or more, the county legislative authority may replace the office of coroner with a medical examiner system and appoint a medical examiner as specified in RCW 36.24.190. Any county may enter into an interlocal agreement under chapter 39.34 RCW with an adjoining county for the provision of coroner or medical examiner services.</p>
</li>
