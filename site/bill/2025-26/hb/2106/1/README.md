# HB 2106 - Requiring carriers to provide substantive notice to health care providers and health care facilities about significant contract modifications.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2106.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that a healthy insurance market requires that major changes to contract terms and expectations between health carriers and providers or facilities be provided in a transparent manner that reflects mutual agreement between the parties. The legislature finds that unilateral changes by health carriers to payment or service delivery through policy changes violate principles of fair contracting and contribute to avoidable contract terminations and changes to access to services for patients. The legislature intends to remedy this by requiring certain policy changes be clearly communicated and mutually agreed upon by the parties before implementation.

## Section 2
1. A carrier shall provide notice of a significant payer contract modification to the contract representative of the relevant health care provider or health care facility no less than 90 days before the effective date of the significant payer contract modification. This notice must:

    a. Specify the precise provider contract to which the significant payer contract modification applies and be conspicuously labeled as "notice of significant payer contract modification to provider contract";

    b. Contain sufficient information about the change to allow the health care provider or health care facility to assess the financial impact, if any, of the significant payer contract modification;

    c. Include the specific language of the significant payer contract modification;

    d. Be sent to the person designated to receive notice under the terms of the relevant provider contract; and

    e. Inform the health care provider or health care facility that the provider or facility shall accept or reject the terms of the significant payer contract modification through written or electronic means during the notice period and that a rejection may not affect the terms of the health care provider's or health care facility's existing provider contract with the carrier.

2. A health care provider or health care facility shall affirmatively accept or reject the significant payer contract modification. The rejection of a significant payer contract modification by the health care provider or health care facility may not affect the terms of the existing provider contract.

3. [Empty]

    a. If a carrier fails to comply with the requirements of this section, the significant payer contract modification is void.

    b. If a provider contract contains a provision that violates this section, that provision of the provider contract is void.

4. A carrier shall include a summary of all notices of significant payer contract modifications in a single location on the carrier's website and in the carrier's newsletters no less than 90 days before the effective date of the significant payer contract modification.

5. For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:

    a. [Empty]
