<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds and declares all of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and other ortho-phthalates are toxic chemicals and can have negative impacts on human health as determined by the United States food and drug administration and the United States environmental protection agency;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DEHP and other ortho-phthalates are used primarily to produce flexibility in plastics, mainly polyvinyl chloride (PVC);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DEHP is the most common plasticizer used in medical devices, including intravenous solution containers (IV bags) and intravenous tubing;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over the course of its shelf life, DEHP leaches out of the plastic into the solution being held in the container;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DEHP is classified as an endocrine-disrupting compound, meaning it can interfere with the hormonal system in humans and animals. It can mimic or block the actions of hormones, leading to adverse effects on reproductive health, development, and metabolism;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Studies have suggested a potential link between DEHP exposure and certain types of cancer, including breast, liver, lung, and testicular cancer. The United States environmental protection agency has determined that DEHP is a probable human carcinogen;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DEHP exposure has been associated with adverse effects on reproductive organs and fertility. It can disrupt normal reproductive development, reduce sperm quality, and affect hormone levels in both males and females;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DEHP is metabolized in the liver and can accumulate in the body over time. Prolonged exposure to high levels of DEHP has been shown to cause liver and kidney damage in animal studies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inhalation or ingestion of DEHP can cause respiratory irritation and allergic reactions in some individuals, particularly those with preexisting respiratory conditions or sensitivities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DEHP dosed at varying concentrations in cell culture studies has been linked to potential multidrug resistance in breast cancer cells that may inhibit the effectiveness of breast cancer drugs; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Triple-negative breast cancer cells dosed in culture with DEHP have been potentially linked to multidrug resistance, inhibiting the apoptosis mechanism induced by breast cancer drugs such as tamoxifen and increasing cell proliferation in vitro. One proposed mechanism is that DEHP may serve as a mitogenic factor for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells, potentially making them multidrug resistant.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
