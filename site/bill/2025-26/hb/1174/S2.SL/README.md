## Section 1
It is hereby declared to be the policy of this state to secure the rights, constitutional or otherwise, of persons who, because of a non-English-speaking cultural background, are unable to readily understand or communicate in the English language, and who consequently cannot be fully protected in legal proceedings unless  interpreters are available to assist them.

It is the intent of the legislature in the passage of this chapter to provide for the use and procedure for the appointment of such interpreters.

## Section 2
As used in this chapter:

## Section 3

    a. Credentialed interpreters shall be appointed in legal proceedings involving participation of persons with limited English proficiency, unless good cause is found on the record for appointing a noncredentialed interpreter.

        i. Given the totality of the circumstances, including the nature of the proceeding and the potential penalty or consequences involved, the services of a credentialed interpreter are not reasonably available; or

        ii. The current list of interpreters maintained by the administrative office of the courts does not include an interpreter credentialed in the language spoken by the person with limited English proficiency.

2. If good cause is found for using an interpreter who is not

credentialed, the judicial or presiding officer shall make a preliminary determination on the record that the proposed interpreter is able to interpret accurately all communications to and from the person with limited English proficiency in that particular proceeding. The judicial or presiding officer shall consider testimony and the needs of the person with limited English proficiency in making this determination.

3. After an appropriate colloquy or other process permitted by statute or regulation, the judicial or presiding officer shall satisfy itself and state on the record that:

    a. The proposed interpreter is capable of communicating effectively in English and in the non-English language. If the interpreter is assigned to interpret between two non-English languages (relay interpreter), the interpreter shall not be required to communicate in English;

    b. The proposed interpreter has read, understands, and will abide by the code of professional responsibility for judiciary interpreters established by court rule. If the interpreter does not meet this requirement, the interpreter may be given time to review the code of professional responsibility for judiciary interpreters; and

    c. The person with limited English proficiency can understand the interpreter.

4. The court shall inquire whether the interpreter can accurately interpret:

    a. In the consecutive mode, if that mode of interpretation is expected to be used; and

    b. The administrative office of the courts shall maintain the list of credentialed interpreters and a record of the oath in the same manner .

2. Subject to other processes permitted by statute or regulation, before any person serving as an interpreter for the court or agency begins to interpret, the judicial or presiding officer shall require the interpreter to state the interpreter's name on the record and whether the interpreter is a credentialed interpreter. If the interpreter is not a credentialed interpreter, the interpreter must be qualified on the record.

3. Before beginning to interpret, every interpreter appointed under this chapter shall take an oath unless the interpreter is a credentialed interpreter who has taken the oath as required in subsection (1) of this section. The oath must affirm that the interpreter will make a true interpretation to the person being examined of all the proceedings in a language which the person understands, and that the interpreter will repeat the statements of the person being examined to the court or agency conducting the proceedings, in the English language, to the best of the interpreter's skill and judgment.

## Section 5
1. The right to an interpreter may not be waived except when:

    a. A  person with limited English proficiency requests a waiver on the record; and

    b. The judicial or presiding officer determines on the record that the waiver has been made knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently.

2. The waiver of the right to an interpreter may be set aside and an interpreter appointedat the discretion of the judicial or presiding officer at any time during the proceedings.
