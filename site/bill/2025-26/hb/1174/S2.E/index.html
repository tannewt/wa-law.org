<pre><code>a. Credentialed interpreters shall be appointed in legal proceedings involving participation of persons with limited English proficiency, unless good cause is found on the record for appointing a noncredentialed interpreter.

b. For purposes of this chapter, &quot;good cause&quot; includes, but is not limited to, a determination that:

    i. Given the totality of the circumstances, including the nature of the proceeding and the potential penalty or consequences involved, the services of a credentialed interpreter are not reasonably available; or
