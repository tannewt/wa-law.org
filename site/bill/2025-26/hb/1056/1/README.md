# HB 1056 - Law enf. misconduct

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1056.pdf)

## Section 1
The state of Washington and its subdivisions undertake to protect the safety of individuals and to preserve public peace by employing peace officers who are entrusted with the power to arrest, detain, and use force against individuals suspected of violating criminal statutes, and local corrections officers who are responsible for the custody, safety, and security of incarcerated individuals. The legislature recognizes that systemic abuses of this power, such as repeated officer misconduct in using excessive force; unlawful stops, searches, or arrests; discriminatory practices that violate the rights of people in Washington; and the provision of substandard conditions of confinement and inadequate medical care to detainees and prisoners, harm public safety, hinder effectiveness, and decrease trust in law enforcement and corrections agencies.

It is the intent of the legislature to clarify existing authority and authorize the attorney general's office to investigate and, if necessary, bring suit against law enforcement agencies and local corrections agencies to compel needed reforms where there are violations of constitutional and civil rights, in order to promote effective and constitutional policing, detention, and incarceration practices across the state, provide significant, systemic relief and transparency, increase community confidence in law enforcement and corrections agencies, and improve officer and agency accountability with respect to policing, detention, and incarceration practices.

This state level authority is not intended to address isolated acts of misconduct or to hold individual officers liable for misconduct. This state authority is necessary to promote a consistent level of quality policing for all Washingtonians. This act does not preempt, limit, diminish, or otherwise affect any other cause of action or appropriate remedy authorized by state or federal law.

## Section 2

1. "Local corrections agency" means any county, city, or local agency providing or otherwise responsible for the custody, safety, and security of adults or juveniles incarcerated in correctional, jail, or detention facilities. "Local corrections agency" does not include the Washington department of corrections or any other agency, department, or division of state government.

2. "Local corrections officer" means any employee, whether part time or full time, of a county, city, or local jail, correctional, or detention facility who is responsible for the custody, safety, and security of adult or juvenile persons confined in the facility.

    a. The local law enforcement agency or local corrections agency in an attempt to clarify and remedy the alleged violations;

    b. The office of independent investigations to ensure that any investigation under this section will not interfere with or impede an ongoing investigation being conducted by the office of independent investigations.

## Section 4

## Section 5
By September 1, 2026, the attorney general shall develop and publish a model policy for law enforcement agency accountability systems, specifying model practices for receiving complaints of serious misconduct, conducting investigations of serious misconduct, imposing discipline for serious misconduct, and addressing disciplinary appeals.

The model policy shall be consistent with standards adopted in other attorney general published model policies addressing policing practices, including policies governing use of force, and reporting practices. In developing this policy, the attorney general shall consult with the criminal justice training commission, the office of independent investigations, the state auditor's office, law enforcement agencies, police unions, independent oversight bodies, city attorneys and county prosecutors, people impacted by police misconduct, policing experts, and police accountability advocates.

## Section 6
