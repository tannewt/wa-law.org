# HB 1955 - Fishing & shellfishing/youth

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1955.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that youth benefit by engaging in outdoor activities, such as fishing and shellfishing. Participating in such activities can boost self-esteem and cultivate an appreciation for nature. The legislature further finds that license fees can be a barrier to this activity for some youth. Therefore, the legislature intends to reduce financial barriers to fishing and shellfishing by increasing the age at which a fishing license is required.
