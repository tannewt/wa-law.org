<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that youth benefit by engaging in outdoor activities, such as fishing and shellfishing. Participating in such activities can boost self-esteem and cultivate an appreciation for nature. The legislature further finds that license fees can be a barrier to this activity for some youth. Therefore, the legislature intends to reduce financial barriers to fishing and shellfishing by increasing the age at which a fishing license is required.</p>
