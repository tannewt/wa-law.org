# HB 2297 - Grocery store incentives

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2297-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that access to affordable, nutritious, and culturally relevant food is essential to health, economic stability, and community well-being. Yet many Washington residents, particularly low-income households, communities of color, rural residents, immigrants and refugees, and people with limited transportation options continue to face barriers to food access due to store closures, uneven infrastructure, and long-standing patterns of disinvestment.

2. It is the intent of the legislature to provide locally controlled tools to preserve existing grocery stores and support the development and retention of grocery stores in underserved communities where market forces alone have not met community needs. By reducing structural cost barriers, this act is intended to strengthen community-serving food retailers and support local jobs and neighborhood stability. The legislature further intends that these incentives be implemented in a manner responsive to local conditions and as part of a broader effort to promote health equity, economic justice, and long-term community stability.

## Section 101
1. [Empty]

    a. The cities, working through the association of Washington cities, shall form a model ordinance development committee made up of a representative sampling of cities that as of July 27, 2003, impose a business and occupation tax. This committee shall work through the association of Washington cities to adopt a model ordinance on municipal gross receipts business and occupation tax. The model ordinance and subsequent amendments shall be adopted using a process that includes opportunity for substantial input from business stakeholders and other members of the public. Input shall be solicited from statewide business associations and from local chambers of commerce and downtown business associations in cities that levy a business and occupation tax.

    b. The department of commerce shall contract to post the model ordinance on an internet website and to make paper copies available for inspection upon request. The department of revenue and the department of licensing shall post copies of or links to the model ordinance on their internet websites. Additionally, a city that imposes a business and occupation tax must make copies of its ordinance available for inspection and copying as provided in chapter 42.56 RCW.

    c. The definitions and tax classifications in the model ordinance may not be amended more frequently than once every four years, however the model ordinance may be amended at any time to comply with changes in state law. Any amendment to a mandatory provision of the model ordinance must be adopted with the same effective date by all cities.

2. A city that imposes a business and occupation tax must adopt the mandatory provisions of the model ordinance. The following provisions are mandatory:

    a. A system of credits that meets the requirements of RCW 35.102.060 and a form for such use;

    b. A uniform, minimum small business tax threshold of at least the equivalent of twenty thousand dollars in gross income annually. A city may elect to deviate from this requirement by creating a higher threshold or exemption but it shall not deviate lower than the level required in this subsection. If a city has a small business threshold or exemption in excess of that provided in this subsection as of January 1, 2003, and chooses to deviate below the threshold or exemption level that was in place as of January 1, 2003, the city must notify all businesses licensed to do business within the city at least one hundred twenty days prior to the potential implementation of a lower threshold or exemption amount;

    c. Tax reporting frequencies that meet the requirements of RCW 35.102.070;

    d. Penalty and interest provisions that meet the requirements of RCW 35.102.080 and 35.102.090;

The definitions in chapter 82.04 RCW shall be used as the baseline for all definitions in the model ordinance, and any deviation in the model ordinance from these definitions must be described by a comment in the model ordinance.

3. Except for the deduction required by RCW 35.102.160 and the system of credits developed to address multiple taxation under subsection (2)(a) of this section, a city may adopt its own provisions for tax exemptions, tax credits, preferential rates, and tax deductions.

4. Any city that adopts an ordinance that deviates from the nonmandatory provisions of the model ordinance shall make a description of such differences available to the public, in written and electronic form.

## Section 102
The taxing authority granted to cities for taxes upon business activities measured by gross receipts or gross income from sales shall not exceed a rate of .0020; except that any city with an adopted ordinance at a higher rate, as of January 1, 1982 shall be limited to a maximum increase of ten percent of the January 1982 rate, not to exceed an annual incremental increase of two percent of current rate: PROVIDED, That any adopted ordinance which classifies according to different types of business or services shall be subject to both the ten percent and the two percent annual incremental increase limitation on each tax rate: PROVIDED FURTHER, That all surtaxes on business and occupation classifications in effect as of January 1, 1982, shall expire no later than December 31, 1982, or by expiration date established by local ordinance.

10. Low-income criteria are as follows:

    a. Each census tract within the area meets one or more income criteria used in the food access research atlas published by the United States department of agriculture; or

    b. Twenty-five percent or more of the population in each census tract within the area has an income at or below 200 percent of poverty thresholds reflected in the most recently available five-year American community survey estimates.

11. To meet the criteria for a health disadvantaged area, each census tract in the area must have an index score of eight or above on the most recently published department of health environmental health disparities map index, indicating the highest composite levels of health disadvantage based on a combination of environmental, health, socioeconomic, and demographic factors.

12. To meet the criteria for a low-access area, at least 500 people within each tract or 33 percent of the population within each tract must reside more than 0.5 miles from the nearest grocery store for an urban census tract or greater than 10 miles from the nearest grocery store for a rural census tract.

## Section 312
1. If the value of the real property or real property improvements have been exempted under this chapter, the real property and real property improvements continue to be exempted for the applicable period under this chapter so long as they are not converted to another use and continue to satisfy all applicable conditions including, but not limited to, zoning, land use, and building requirements.

2. Transfer of property ownership does not terminate the exemption. The exemption is subject to the successor meeting the eligibility requirements under this chapter. The transferor of an exempted property must notify the governing authority of the transfer. The governing authority must certify that the successor meets the requirements of the exemption. The transferor must provide the information necessary for the county assessor to transfer the exemption. If the transferor fails to notify the city or county within 60 days, the tax exemption is terminated and all exempted property taxes from the date of the transfer are immediately due and payable by the transferor as required in subsection (4) of this section.

3. If an owner voluntarily opts to discontinue compliance with the requirements of this chapter, the owner must notify the county assessor within 60 days of the change in use or intended discontinuance and all exempted property taxes from the date of the initial exemption are immediately due and payable by the transferor as required in subsection (4) of this section.

4. If, after a certificate of tax exemption has been filed with the county assessor, the city or county discovers that a portion of the property has changed or will be changed to disqualify the property for exemption eligibility under this chapter, the tax exemption must be canceled, and the following occurs:

    a. Additional real property tax must be imposed on the value of the nonqualifying improvements in the amount that would be imposed if an exemption had not been available under this chapter, plus a penalty equal to 20 percent of the additional value. This additional tax is calculated based upon the difference between the property tax paid and the property tax that would have been paid if it had included the value of the nonqualifying improvements dated back to the date that the improvements were converted to a nonqualifying use;

    b. Interest upon the amounts of the additional tax at the same statutory rate charged on delinquent property taxes must be included from the dates on which the additional tax could have been paid without penalty if the improvements had been assessed at a value without regard to this chapter; and

    c. The additional tax owed together with interest and penalty becomes a lien on the property and attaches at the time the property or portion of the property is removed from the qualifying use under this chapter, or the amenities no longer meet the applicable requirements for exemption under this chapter. A lien under this section has priority to, and must be fully paid and satisfied before, a recognizance, mortgage, judgment, debt, obligation, or responsibility to or with which the property may become charged or liable. The lien may be foreclosed upon expiration of the same period after delinquency and in the same manner provided by law for foreclosure of liens for delinquent real property taxes. An additional tax unpaid on its due date is delinquent. From the date of delinquency until paid, interest must be charged at the same rate applied by law to delinquent property taxes.

5. Upon a determination that a tax exemption is to be terminated for a reason stated in this section, the city's or county's governing authority must notify the record owner of the property as shown by the tax rolls by mail, return receipt requested, of the determination to terminate the exemption. The owner may appeal the determination to the city or county, within 30 days by filing a notice of appeal with the city or county, which notice must specify the factual and legal basis on which the determination of termination is alleged to be erroneous. At an appeal hearing, all affected parties may be heard and all competent evidence received. After the hearing, the deciding body or officer must either affirm, modify, or repeal the decision of termination of exemption based on the evidence received. An aggrieved party may appeal the decision of the deciding body or officer to the superior court as provided in RCW 34.05.510 through 34.05.598.

6. Upon determination by the city or county to terminate an exemption, the county officials having possession of the assessment and tax rolls must correct the rolls in the manner provided for omitted property under RCW 84.40.080. The county assessor must make such a valuation of the property and improvements as is necessary to permit the correction of the rolls.
