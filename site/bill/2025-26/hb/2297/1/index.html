<li>
<p>The legislature finds that access to affordable, nutritious, and culturally relevant food is essential to health, economic stability, and community well-being. Yet many Washington residents, particularly low-income households, communities of color, rural residents, immigrants and refugees, and people with limited transportation options continue to face barriers to food access due to store closures, uneven infrastructure, and long-standing patterns of disinvestment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to provide locally controlled tools to preserve existing grocery stores and support the development and retention of grocery stores in underserved communities where market forces alone have not met community needs. By reducing structural cost barriers, this act is intended to strengthen community-serving food retailers and support local jobs and neighborhood stability. The legislature further intends that these incentives be implemented in a manner responsive to local conditions and as part of a broader effort to promote health equity, economic justice, and long-term community stability.</p>

<p>The city's or county's governing authority may enact an ordinance to provide a process for an owner to appeal a decision by the city or county that the owner is not entitled to a certificate of tax exemption to the city or county. The owner may appeal a decision by the city or county to deny a certificate of tax exemption in superior court under RCW 34.05.510 through 34.05.598 if the appeal is filed within 30 days of notification by the city or county to the owner of the exemption denial.</p>

<p>Thirty days after the anniversary of the date of the certificate of tax exemption and each year for the tax exemption period, the owner of the exempted property must file with a designated authorized representative of the city or county an annual report indicating the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A certification by the owner that the property has not changed use that is, if the owner of the property and the retailer are not the same individual, verified by the grocery store retailer;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A description of changes or improvements constructed after issuance of the certificate of tax exemption; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any additional information requested by the city or county.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A city or county that issues a certificate of tax exemption under this chapter must report annually by December 31st of each year, beginning in 2026, to the department of commerce. The report must include the following information:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The number of tax exemption certificates granted;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The total number and type of existing buildings exempted, and the total number and type of rehabilitated and new grocery stores constructed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The value of the tax exemption for each project receiving a tax exemption and the total value of tax exemptions granted;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The methodology and data used by the governing authority when designating underserved community zones; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An explanation of how the program is working to supply fresh and healthy food and new job opportunities to underserved communities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A city or county that issues a certificate of tax exemption under this chapter must annually provide a report to the department of revenue that provides the information required in subsection (2) of this section and any other information that the department of revenue requires to verify eligibility for the business and occupation tax incentives created in sections 401 and 501 of this act.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-312">Section 312 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-312">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the value of the real property or real property improvements have been exempted under this chapter, the real property and real property improvements continue to be exempted for the applicable period under this chapter so long as they are not converted to another use and continue to satisfy all applicable conditions including, but not limited to, zoning, land use, and building requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer of property ownership does not terminate the exemption. The exemption is subject to the successor meeting the eligibility requirements under this chapter. The transferor of an exempted property must notify the governing authority of the transfer. The governing authority must certify that the successor meets the requirements of the exemption. The transferor must provide the information necessary for the county assessor to transfer the exemption. If the transferor fails to notify the city or county within 60 days, the tax exemption is terminated and all exempted property taxes from the date of the transfer are immediately due and payable by the transferor as required in subsection (4) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an owner voluntarily opts to discontinue compliance with the requirements of this chapter, the owner must notify the county assessor within 60 days of the change in use or intended discontinuance and all exempted property taxes from the date of the transfer are immediately due and payable by the transferor as required in subsection (4) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If, after a certificate of tax exemption has been filed with the county assessor, the city or county discovers that a portion of the property has changed or will be changed to disqualify the property for exemption eligibility under this chapter, the tax exemption must be canceled, and the following occurs:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Additional real property tax must be imposed on the value of the nonqualifying improvements in the amount that would be imposed if an exemption had not been available under this chapter, plus a penalty equal to 20 percent of the additional value. This additional tax is calculated based upon the difference between the property tax paid and the property tax that would have been paid if it had included the value of the nonqualifying improvements dated back to the date that the improvements were converted to a nonqualifying use;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interest upon the amounts of the additional tax at the same statutory rate charged on delinquent property taxes must be included from the dates on which the additional tax could have been paid without penalty if the improvements had been assessed at a value without regard to this chapter; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The additional tax owed together with interest and penalty becomes a lien on the property and attaches at the time the property or portion of the property is removed from the qualifying use under this chapter, or the amenities no longer meet the applicable requirements for exemption under this chapter. A lien under this section has priority to, and must be fully paid and satisfied before, a recognizance, mortgage, judgment, debt, obligation, or responsibility to or with which the property may become charged or liable. The lien may be foreclosed upon expiration of the same period after delinquency and in the same manner provided by law for foreclosure of liens for delinquent real property taxes. An additional tax unpaid on its due date is delinquent. From the date of delinquency until paid, interest must be charged at the same rate applied by law to delinquent property taxes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon a determination that a tax exemption is to be terminated for a reason stated in this section, the city's or county's governing authority must notify the record owner of the property as shown by the tax rolls by mail, return receipt requested, of the determination to terminate the exemption. The owner may appeal the determination to the city or county, within 30 days by filing a notice of appeal with the city or county, which notice must specify the factual and legal basis on which the determination of termination is alleged to be erroneous. At an appeal hearing, all affected parties may be heard and all competent evidence received. After the hearing, the deciding body or officer must either affirm, modify, or repeal the decision of termination of exemption based on the evidence received. An aggrieved party may appeal the decision of the deciding body or officer to the superior court as provided in RCW 34.05.510 through 34.05.598.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon determination by the city or county to terminate an exemption, the county officials having possession of the assessment and tax rolls must correct the rolls in the manner provided for omitted property under RCW 84.40.080. The county assessor must make such a valuation of the property and improvements as is necessary to permit the correction of the rolls. The value of the new construction from the rehabilitated grocery store or the newly constructed grocery store added to the rolls is considered new construction for the purposes of chapter 84.40 RCW. The owner may appeal the valuation to the county board of equalization as provided in chapter 84.40 RCW. If there has been a failure to comply with this chapter, the property must be listed as an omitted assessment for assessment years beginning January 1st of the calendar year in which the noncompliance first occurred, but the listing as an omitted assessment may not be for a period more than three calendar years preceding the year in which the failure to comply was discovered.</p>
