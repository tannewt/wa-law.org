# HB 2168 - Overdose mapping information

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2168-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that substance use disorder and drug overdose is a major health problem that affects the lives of many people and multiple service systems, and leads to profound consequences, including permanent injury or death. Accidental overdoses caused by opioids and other legal and illegal drugs are a Washington state health crisis that stress and strain the financial, public health, health care, and public safety resources in Washington state. This impact occurs because there are few central databases that can quickly help identify this problem and limited funding for support to mitigate the crisis and risks statewide.

2. The legislature finds there is a need for collaboration among local, regional, and state agencies and service systems within Washington, and other partners to establish a comprehensive system addressing the problems associated with overdoses and to reduce duplicative requirements across local, county, state, public safety, and health care agencies. Formalized collaboration will allow these entities to combine their numerous resources and strengths, thus reducing insular decision making. Contemporaneous data collection about, and analysis of, confirmed or suspected overdoses within Washington will further allow state and local agencies to focus on specific areas where the following are needed most in order to maximize resources: (a) Outreach and implementation of risk reduction strategies; (b) real-time notification of spikes in overdose activity; (c) public education about overdose prevention; and (d) treatment, supportive services, and other health care options to reduce demand.

3. Therefore, the legislature intends to:

    a. Provide near real-time drug overdose analysis of confirmed or suspected overdoses occurring within Washington, using a specialized program to collect information about overdose incidents that supports public health efforts to mobilize an immediate response to a sudden increase in overdoses;

    b. Provide a centralized resource that can collect information about overdose incidents and make the data available to the health care community, and municipal, county, and state agencies to quickly identify needs and provide short and long-term solutions while protecting and respecting the privacy rights of individuals;

    c. Prevent accidental overdoses by quickly identifying the areas within Washington where overdoses pose the highest risk to the community;

    d. Enable local, regional, and state agencies and service systems to develop effective strategies for addressing confirmed or suspected overdoses occurring within their jurisdictions and implement interventional strategies; and

    e. Encourage formal collaborative agreements among local, regional, and state agencies and service systems that enhance present and future work pertaining to the various health care and public safety aspects of this crisis.

    a. Beginning January 1, 2027, the department shall submit the information required under this section to the overdose detection mapping application program to report all incidences of fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses submitted to the Washington emergency medical services information system. The department shall establish an application programing interface or similar process to allow for the near time transfer of the information required under the section between the Washington emergency medical services information system and the overdose detection mapping application program.

    b. Within 24 hours of submission of a patient care report by a licensed ambulance service, aid service, or other emergency medical services provider into the Washington emergency medical services information system, the department shall submit the following information for each patient care report to the overdose detection mapping application program:

        i. The date and time of the overdose;

2. Within the parameters established in subsection (1)(b)(ii) of this section, geolocation data specificity submitted to the overdose detection mapping application program is at the discretion of the department but should allow for effective deployment of resources in areas affected by overdose spikes.

3. Information submitted under this section by the department or available through the overdose detection mapping application program may not be used for law enforcement welfare checks, warrant checks, or criminal investigations or prosecution of the individual who was treated by the emergency medical services providers for experiencing the suspected or actual overdose.

4. The department may not submit any information pursuant to this section that allows for or creates a risk of identification of an individual or individuals experiencing a suspected or actual overdose.

5. If any federal agency obtains access to any information pursuant to this section held by the department without prior authorization, use of and access to the overdose detection mapping application program will be immediately terminated.
