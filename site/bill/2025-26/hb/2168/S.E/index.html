<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that substance use disorder and drug overdose is a major health problem that affects the lives of many people and multiple service systems, and leads to profound consequences, including permanent injury or death. Accidental overdoses caused by opioids and other legal and illegal drugs are a Washington state health crisis that stress and strain the financial, public health, health care, and public safety resources in Washington state. This impact occurs because there are few central databases that can quickly help identify this problem and limited funding for support to mitigate the crisis and risks statewide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds there is a need for collaboration among local, regional, and state agencies and service systems within Washington, and other partners to establish a comprehensive system addressing the problems associated with overdoses and to reduce duplicative requirements across local, county, state, public safety, and health care agencies. Formalized collaboration will allow these entities to combine their numerous resources and strengths, thus reducing insular decision making. Contemporaneous data collection about, and analysis of, confirmed or suspected overdoses within Washington will further allow state and local agencies to focus on specific areas where the following are needed most in order to maximize resources: (a) Outreach and implementation of risk reduction strategies; (b) real-time notification of spikes in overdose activity; (c) public education about overdose prevention; and (d) treatment, supportive services, and other health care options to reduce demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Provide near real-time drug overdose analysis of confirmed or suspected overdoses occurring within Washington, using a specialized program to collect information about overdose incidents that supports public health efforts to mobilize an immediate response to a sudden increase in overdoses;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a centralized resource that can collect information about overdose incidents and make the data available to the health care community, and municipal, county, and state agencies to quickly identify needs and provide short and long-term solutions while protecting and respecting the privacy rights of individuals;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prevent accidental overdoses by quickly identifying the areas within Washington where overdoses pose the highest risk to the community;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable local, regional, and state agencies and service systems to develop effective strategies for addressing confirmed or suspected overdoses occurring within their jurisdictions and implement interventional strategies; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage formal collaborative agreements among local, regional, and state agencies and service systems that enhance present and future work pertaining to the various health care and public safety aspects of this crisis.</p>
