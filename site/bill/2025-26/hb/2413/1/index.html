<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Demand for electricity in Washington state is projected to grow rapidly before the end of the decade due to several factors, including economic growth, transportation electrification, demand from data centers, and the shift to electric heating. Projections from the northwest power and conservation council and the western regional adequacy program show the potential for energy shortages in the near term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The utilities and transportation commission has stated that &quot;meeting the pace of growth anticipated in utility IRPs (integrated resource plans) will require annual resource additions equal to four to five times historic levels. The study finds the region experiencing significant headwinds due to permitting and interconnection delays, changes in federal policy, and higher costs. Without any new resource additions, the region would have a gap in resources beginning in 2026 and growing to 9 gigawatts by 2030, which is approximately the load of the state of Oregon.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, to provide the regulatory flexibility to meet Washington's growing demand for electricity, the legislature finds that power producers and utilities need additional tools to meet the growing demand for electricity in ways that balance Washington's goal of reducing CO2 emissions.</p>

<li>The department, for consumer-owned utilities, or the utilities and transportation commission, for investor-owned utilities, must, upon petition by an electric utility, consider whether resource adequacy metrics indicate that a resource adequacy crisis exists. Upon petition, the department or the utilities and transportation commission must determine that a resource adequacy crisis exists if one of the following three criteria is in place:</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) The northwest power and conservation council estimate for loss of load events for the region including Washington is greater than triple their threshold target of 0.1, and the peak magnitude exceeds their threshold target of 1,200 megawatts;</p>
<p>(B) A loss of load event greater than the northwest power and conservation council's thresholds for duration, or eight hours, and magnitude, or 1,200 megawatts, occurs in Washington; or</p>
<p>(C) In a resource plan or integrated resource plan filed and approved under chapter 19.280 RCW, an electric utility determines a greater than five percent loss of load probability without new resources within a four-year planning period.</p>
<pre><code>    ii. The department or the utilities and transportation commission is not required to find that a criterion specified in (b)(i)(A), (B), or (C) of this subsection is in place if the department or the utilities and transportation commission has clear and convincing evidence that the assumptions, calculations, or methodology used in determining those criteria were inaccurate and should not be the basis for the declaration of a resource adequacy crisis.

    iii. In the event that the department or the utilities and transportation commission determines the existence of a resource adequacy crisis under (b)(i) of this subsection, an electric utility may designate an amount, in megawatt hours, and duration, of up to 30 years, for electricity generated from natural gas to meet reliability targets without being in violation of RCW 19.405.040(1) or 19.405.050(1).

<li>
<p>Through December 31, 2044, an electric utility may satisfy up to twenty percent of its compliance obligation under (a) of this subsection with an alternative compliance option consistent with this section. An alternative compliance option may include any combination of the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Making an alternative compliance payment under RCW 19.405.090(2);</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) Unbundled renewable energy credits produced from eligible renewable resources, as defined under RCW 19.285.030, which may be used by the electric utility for compliance with RCW 19.285.040 and this section as provided under RCW 19.285.040(2)(e); and</p>
<p>(B) Unbundled renewable energy credits, other than those included in (b)(ii)(A) of this subsection, that represent electricity generated within the compliance period;</p>
<pre><code>    iii. Investing in energy transformation projects, including additional conservation and efficiency resources beyond what is otherwise required under this section, provided the projects meet the requirements of subsection (2) of this section and are not credited as resources used to meet the standard under (a) of this subsection; or

    iv. Using electricity from an energy recovery facility using municipal solid waste as the principal fuel source, where the facility was constructed prior to 1992, and the facility is operated in compliance with federal laws and regulations and meets state air quality standards. An electric utility may only use electricity from such an energy recovery facility if the department and the department of ecology determine that electricity generation at the facility provides a net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to any other available waste management best practice. The determination must be based on a life-cycle analysis comparing the energy recovery facility to other technologies available in the jurisdiction in which the facility is located for the waste management best practices of waste reduction, recycling, composting, and minimizing the use of a landfill.

c. Electricity from renewable resources used to meet the standard under (a) of this subsection must be verified by the retirement of renewable energy credits. Renewable energy credits must be tracked and retired in the tracking system selected by the department.

d. Hydroelectric generation used by an electric utility in meeting the standard under (a) of this subsection may not include new diversions, new impoundments, new bypass reaches, or expansion of existing reservoirs constructed after May 7, 2019, unless the diversions, bypass reaches, or reservoir expansions are necessary for the operation of a pumped storage facility that: (i) Does not conflict with existing state or federal fish recovery plans; and (ii) complies with all local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

e. Nothing in (d) of this subsection precludes an electric utility that owns and operates hydroelectric generating facilities, or the owner of a hydroelectric generating facility whose energy output is marketed by the Bonneville power administration, from making efficiency or other improvements to its hydroelectric generating facilities existing as of May 7, 2019, or from installing hydroelectric generation in pipes, culverts, irrigation canals, and other man-made waterways, as long as those changes do not create conflicts with existing state or federal fish recovery plans and comply with all local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

f. Nonemitting electric generation used to meet the standard under (a) of this subsection must be generated during the compliance period and must be verified by documentation that the electric utility owns the nonpower attributes of the electricity generated by the nonemitting electric generation resource.

g. Nothing in this section prohibits an electric utility from purchasing or exchanging power from the Bonneville power administration.

h. An electric utility is not in violation of the requirements of this subsection (1) as a result of using electricity generated consistent with a declared resource adequacy crisis under RCW 19.405.090(11)(b).
