# HB 2544 - Upper Columbia water rights

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2544-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. Due to the unique nature of the water rights in the upper Columbia river area, the legislature finds that it would create efficiencies and reduce unnecessary costs on water users to phase the general adjudication process to address significant federal and tribal water rights claims prior to engaging other claimants and streamline service of process requirements.

2. It is the intent of the legislature to establish a pilot process to determine whether there would be an overall benefit to water users throughout the state to modify the procedures for future general adjudications statewide.

## Section 2
1. The department is authorized to and shall initiate a general adjudication of the upper Columbia river in accordance with this section. When initiated, the provisions under RCW 90.03.110 through 90.03.130, and 90.44.220 do not apply to this adjudication.

2. The department may initiate the general adjudication of the upper Columbia river area by filing in the superior court of Stevens county a report containing the following:

    a. A brief statement of the facts in relation to such water, and the necessity for a determination of the rights thereto; and

    b. A map of the geographic area to be included in the general adjudication.

3. Prior to filing the adjudication under subsection (2) of this section, the department shall:

    a. Consult with the administrative office of the courts to determine whether sufficient judicial resources are available to commence and to prosecute the adjudication in a timely manner under this pilot; and

    b. Inform the appropriate committees of the legislature of the estimated budget needs for the court and the department to conduct the adjudication.

4. Upon the filing of the statement and map as provided in subsection (2) of this section and in accordance with subsection (10) of this section, the judge of Stevens county superior court shall issue an order directing summons to be issued by the court and served by the department on federal and federally recognized tribal government entities known to have asserted water rights within the adjudication area identified under subsection (2)(b) of this section. The return day of the summons must be at least 100, but not more than 130, days after the issuance of the order. For good cause and at the request of the department, the court may extend the return day.

5. Following issuance of summons under subsection (4) of this section, the department shall serve the federal and federally recognized tribal government claimants identified in the summons personally or by first-class mail. Personal service of summons may be made by employees of the department. For service by mail, completion of service occurs five judicial days after mailing.

6. Prior to the return day specified in a summons issued under this section, federal and federally recognized tribal government claimants served under subsection (5) of this section may file their claims with the superior court on a form prepared by the department and approved by the court in accordance with RCW 90.03.140. Notwithstanding RCW 90.03.645(2), at any time after the filing of claims under this subsection, the department may engage in settlement negotiations with federal and federally recognized tribal government claimants and affected federal Columbia basin project irrigation districts with repayment contracts and subject to the provisions of chapter 89.12 RCW. During the course of any settlement negotiation, the parties must provide annual status reports to the superior court by December 31st of each year.

    a. The Stevens county superior court shall issue an order instructing the department to submit a report that identifies potential claimants to the adjudication not already served under this section. The order must be issued by the earlier of:

        i. 180 days after the United States, jointly with one or more tribal governments served under subsection (5) of this section, file a motion to approve a proposed settlement of all claims filed by federal and federally recognized tribal government claimants pursuant to subsection (6) of this section with the Stevens county superior court for consideration under RCW 90.03.645(3); or

        ii. June 1, 2033.

    b. The department shall make reasonable efforts to identify potential claimants by, at a minimum, identifying:

        i. Each person or entity owning real property situated within the area to be adjudicated, but outside the boundaries of a service area of a city, town, or public water system that provides water to property within its service area; and

        ii. All known persons claiming a right to the water sought to be determined.

8. Following receipt of the report of potential claimants under subsection (7) of this section, the court shall make an order directing summons to be issued by the court and served by the department on all potential claimants not already served. The return day of the summons must be 130 days after the anticipated date for completion of service by publication under subsection (9) of this section. For good cause and at the request of the department, the court may extend the return day.

The department shall serve the summons issued under subsection (8) of this section on all entities and persons identified in the report of known potential claimants required under subsection (7) of this section personally or by first-class mail. Personal service of summons may be made by employees of the department. For service by mail, completion of service occurs five judicial days after mailing.

    b. The department shall serve the summons issued under subsection (8) of this section by publication on unidentified potential claimants and any potential claimants where service by mail was returned undelivered or attempts at personal service were ineffective. Service by publication must be made by publication of the summons in a newspaper of general circulation once a week for six consecutive weeks, six publications, in the county in which such proceeding is pending and in each county in which any portion of the water is situated. Service by publication is complete at the end of the sixth week of publication.

    a. The summons and all subsequent court documents for the adjudication under this section must be captioned "In re the general adjudication of all rights to use water in the Upper Columbia River area" or in a substantially similar manner.

    b. The summons must contain a brief statement of the objects and purpose of the proceedings, require the claimants to make and file an adjudication claim to, or interest in, the water involved, and contain a statement that unless they assert such right by the return day, judgment will be entered determining their rights according to the evidence.

11. To the extent consistent with court rules and subject to the availability of funds provided either by direct appropriation or funded through the administrative office of the courts for this specific adjudicative proceeding, the court is encouraged to conduct the water rights adjudication employing innovative practices and technologies appropriate to large scale and complex cases, such as:

    a. Electronic filing of documents, including notices and claims;

    b. Appearance via videoconferencing;

    c. Prefiling of testimony; and

    d. Other practices and technologies consistent with court rules and emerging technologies.

12. Except as provided under subsection (6) of this section, following completion of service of summonses as provided in this section, the general adjudication of the upper Columbia river is subject to RCW 90.03.140 through 90.03.240 and 90.03.620 through 90.03.645.

13. The expenses incurred by the state in a proceeding to determine rights to water initiated under this section or upon appeal of such a determination shall be borne by the state. Subject to the availability of state funding provided either by direct appropriation or funded through the administrative office of the courts for this specific purpose, the county in which an adjudication or a suit to administer an adjudication is being held must be provided the extraordinary costs imposed on the superior court of that county due to the adjudication.

14. Rights subject to determination proceedings conducted under this section include all rights to the use of surface water and groundwater, including all diversionary and instream water rights, and include rights to the use of water claimed by the United States. Any persons claiming the right to water by virtue of a contract with a claimant to the right to divert the same are not necessary parties to the proceeding, except for affected federal Columbia basin project irrigation districts with repayment contracts and subject to the provisions of chapter 89.12 RCW.

15. Nothing in this section may be construed as establishing or creating any new rights to the use of water. This section relates exclusively to the confirmation of water rights established or created under other provisions of state law or under federal laws.

16. Upon expiration of each filing period established by a return day under subsections (4) and (8) of this section, the department shall file a motion for default against defendants who have been served but who have failed to timely file an adjudication claim under RCW 90.03.140. A party in default may file a late claim under the same circumstances the party could respond or defend under court rules on default judgments.

17. The department shall report to the relevant committees of the legislature and the office of financial management by June 15, 2035, to evaluate the pilot process and make recommendations to the legislature for changes to general adjudications to streamline the process, improve efficiency, and reduce costs.

18. This section only applies to the general adjudication of the upper Columbia river area.

19. For purposes of this section:

    a. "Judicial day" means the days of the week other than Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holidays.
