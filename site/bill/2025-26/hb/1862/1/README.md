# HB 1862 - Train length

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1862.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that railroad carriers are continuously increasing the length of trains on the railroads operating within our state. Trains of 10,000 to 15,000 feet in length are regularly traversing our state, while trains greater than 20,000 feet in length have been operating within this state and their operation has become commonplace in other states.

2. Excessively long trains operating over the unique and widely varying geographical terrain in Washington create a significant safety risk to the public and the environment, especially considering that railroad infrastructure and operational technologies do not exist to ensure the safe movement of excessively long trains. The state has an obligation and the authority to ensure railroad operational safety, security, and, in the event of a hazardous material incident, to support first responder activities, the safety of our communities, the expeditious response of emergency services, and the health and welfare of passengers, the public, and railroad employees.

3. Therefore, the legislature declares that this act regulating the length of trains to reduce risk to the public and our localities constitutes an exercise of the state's police power to protect and promote the health, safety, security, and welfare of the residents of the state by reducing the risk exposure to local communities and protecting environmentally sensitive and/or pristine lands and waterways.

1. "Commission" means the utilities and transportation commission created in chapter 80.01 RCW.

    a. Pursuant to the safety provisions of RCW 81.40.025(4), the commission may consider and determine whether to authorize by order railroad carrier requests to operate trains that exceed 8,500 feet in length, up to a maximum of 10,000 feet in length, on specified routes and direction of travel, provided:

        i. Additional crewmembers are assigned to the train, with no less than one additional crewmember positioned on the rear of excess length trains to observe the forward movement and monitor the safe operation of such trains to respond to any issues that become apparent en route;

        ii. On board rolling equipment equipped with an accessible air brake release valve is installed; and

        iii. A mobile radio to ensure communication with other members of the crew and train dispatchers, which is also capable of establishing direct voice communication with government emergency response agencies and responders, is installed.
