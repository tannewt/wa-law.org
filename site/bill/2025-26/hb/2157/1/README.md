Such information and documentation must include artifacts, such as system cards or predeployment impact assessments, including relevant risk management policies and impact assessments.

4. A developer that also serves as a deployer for a high-risk artificial intelligence system may not be required to generate the documentation required by this section unless such high-risk artificial intelligence system is provided to an unaffiliated entity acting as a deployer or as otherwise required by law.

A developer of a high-risk generative artificial intelligence system that generates or substantially modifies synthetic content shall ensure that the outputs of such high-risk artificial intelligence system: (i) Are identifiable and detectable in a manner that is accessible by consumers using industry-standard tools or tools provided by the developer; (ii) comply with any applicable accessibility requirements, as synthetic content, to the extent reasonably feasible; and (iii) apply such identification at the time the output is generated.

    b. If such synthetic content is an audio, image, or video format that forms part of an evidently artistic, creative, satirical, fictional, or analogous work or program, the requirement for identifying outputs of high-risk artificial intelligence systems pursuant to (a) of this subsection (7) is limited to a manner that does not hinder the display or enjoyment of such work or program.

    c. The identification of outputs required by (a) of this subsection (7) do not apply to: (i) Synthetic content that consists exclusively of text, is published to inform the public on any matter of public interest, or is unlikely to mislead a reasonable person consuming such synthetic content; or (ii) the outputs of a high-risk artificial intelligence system that performs an assistive function for standard editing, does not substantially alter the input data provided by the developer, or is used to detect, prevent, investigate, or prosecute any crime as authorized by law.

        iii. A deployer that completes an impact assessment pursuant to this section shall maintain such impact assessment and all records concerning the impact assessment for three years. Throughout the period of time that a high-risk artificial intelligence system is deployed and for a period of at least three years following the final deployment of the high-risk artificial intelligence system, the deployer shall retain all records concerning each impact assessment conducted on the high-risk artificial intelligence system, including all raw data used to evaluate the performance and known limitations of such system.

4. Not later than the time that a deployer uses a high-risk artificial intelligence system to interact with a consumer, the deployer shall disclose to the consumer that the consumer is interacting with an artificial intelligence system. At such time, the deployer shall also disclose to the consumer:

    a. The purpose of such high-risk artificial intelligence system;

    b. The nature of such system;

A deployer that has deployed a high-risk artificial intelligence system to make a consequential decision concerning a consumer shall transmit to the consumer the consequential decision without undue delay. If such consequential decision is adverse to the consumer and based on personal data beyond information that the consumer provided directly to the deployer, the deployer shall provide to the consumer a statement disclosing the principal reason or reasons for the consequential decision, including:

    a. The degree to which and manner in which the high-risk artificial intelligence system contributed to the consequential decision;

    b. The type of data that was processed by such system in making the consequential decision; and

    c. The sources of such data.

6. A deployer shall make readily available a clear statement summarizing how the deployer manages any reasonably foreseeable risk of algorithmic discrimination that may arise from the use or deployment of the high-risk artificial intelligence system.

7. For a disclosure required pursuant to this section, each deployer shall, no later than 30 days after the deployer is notified by the developer that the developer has performed an intentional and substantial modification to a high-risk artificial intelligence system, update such disclosure as necessary to ensure that such disclosure remains accurate.

8. A deployer who performs an intentional and substantial modification to a high-risk artificial intelligence system shall comply with the documentation and disclosure requirements for developers pursuant to section 2 of this act.
