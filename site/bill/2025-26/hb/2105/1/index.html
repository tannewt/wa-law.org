<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that immigrant workers contribute to Washington state's strong economy. According to research from the immigration research initiative, immigrants account for 15 percent of the population in Washington state, yet contribute 21 percent of economic output, or gross domestic product (GDP). Immigrant workers contribute an estimated $145,000,000,000 to Washington state's GDP per year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that civil immigration enforcement through workplace raids conducted by the federal government is disruptive to families and communities, reduces community safety, and is ineffective at deterring illegal conduct by employers or raising standards for workers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that employers could benefit from clarity about their rights and responsibilities when engaging with federal agencies that conduct form I-9 audits. The legislature seeks to provide resources and support to employers about their rights and the rights of their workers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that protecting Washingtonians who are abiding by our state laws and keeping families together is an urgent statewide priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature therefore intends to require Washington employers to provide notice to workers in the event of a form I-9 audit and provide additional protections and support for workers and employers.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The minimum base penalty to the attorney general for a first violation of any provision of sections 3 through 7 of this act is $2,000 times the number of Washington-based workers the employer employs at the time of the violation. Each Washington-based worker counts as one worker for the purposes of determining the penalty multiplier, regardless of whether that worker works full time or part time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the attorney general determines that the first violation of a provision of sections 3 through 7 of this act was a willful violation, the penalty to the attorney general's civil enforcement expenses increases to $5,000 times the number of Washington-based workers the employer employs at the time of the violation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>On a second or subsequent violation of a provision of sections 3 through 7 of this act, the base penalty to the attorney general's civil enforcement expenses is double the penalty assessed for the previous violation, or $10,000 times the number of Washington-based workers the employer employs at the time of the violation, whichever is higher.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The attorney general may pursue legal action to enjoin violations of this act, obtain the penalty outlined in this section, and seek any other appropriate relief at law or equity including actual damages and any reasonable costs and attorneys' fees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to enforcement conducted by the attorney general, a worker, former worker, or a person otherwise believed to be injured by a violation of any provision of sections 3 through 7 of this act or an organization whose membership includes any such person may enforce this act through a private cause of action in superior court to enjoin further violations and recover actual damages together with reasonable attorneys' fees and costs and any other equitable relief or appropriate remedy authorized by state or federal law. If the court finds that the respondent has violated this chapter, it shall award damages up to and including an amount equal to actual damages, or statutory damages equivalent to 80 times the hourly Washington state minimum wage as defined in RCW 49.46.020, per plaintiff per violation, whichever is greater.</p>
