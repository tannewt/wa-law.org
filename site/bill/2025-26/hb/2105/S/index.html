<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that immigrant workers contribute to Washington state's strong economy. According to research from the immigration research initiative, immigrants account for 15 percent of the population in Washington state, yet contribute 21 percent of economic output, or gross domestic product (GDP). Immigrant workers contribute an estimated $145,000,000,000 to Washington state's GDP per year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that civil immigration enforcement through workplace raids conducted by the federal government is disruptive to families and communities, reduces community safety, and is ineffective at deterring illegal conduct by employers or raising standards for workers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that employers could benefit from clarity about their rights and responsibilities when engaging with federal agencies that conduct form I-9 inspections. The legislature seeks to provide resources and support to employers about their rights and the rights of their workers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that protecting Washingtonians who are abiding by our state laws and keeping families together is an urgent statewide priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature therefore intends to require Washington employers to provide notice to workers in the event of a form I-9 inspection and provide additional protections and support for workers and employers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
