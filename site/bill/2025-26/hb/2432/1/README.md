# HB 2432 - Students/surplus technology

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2432.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature acknowledges that requirements in state law governing surplus computer laptops, tablets, and other electronic devices or equipment from education settings can be improved to better support students and families.

2. The legislature intends to allow school districts and other public education agencies the option to prioritize selling these electronic devices or equipment at depreciated cost to public school students or grant these electronic devices or equipment at no cost to qualifying public school students.

3. The legislature believes these changes will reduce barriers for students to accessing these devices and equipment, which will help improve education outcomes, access to information, and career and workforce development.

## Section 2
(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, school districts, educational service districts, or any other state or local governmental agency concerned with education, when declaring texts and other books, equipment, materials or relocatable facilities as surplus, shall, prior to other disposal thereof, serve notice in writing in a newspaper of general circulation in the school district and to any public school district or private school in Washington state annually requesting such a notice, that the same is available for sale, rent, or lease to public school districts or approved private schools, at depreciated cost or fair market value, whichever is greater: PROVIDED, That students wishing to purchase texts pursuant to RCW 28A.320.230(2) (1)(b) shall have priority as to such texts. The notice requirement in this section does not apply to the sale or transfer of assistive devices under RCW 28A.335.205 or chapter 72.40 RCW. Such districts or agencies shall not otherwise sell, rent or lease such surplus property to any person, firm, organization, or nongovernmental agency for at least thirty days following publication of notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the school district.
