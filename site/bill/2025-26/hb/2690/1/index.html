<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that electric utilities play an important role in helping reduce the household energy burden of low-income customers associated with electric service, and that effective energy assistance is best delivered through coordination among utilities, public agencies, nonprofit service providers, and private and charitable funding sources.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that duplicative administrative requirements and unclear funding boundaries can increase costs to utilities and ratepayers without improving the delivery of assistance to households most in need. It is therefore the intent of the legislature to simplify and clarify the administration of energy assistance programs, reduce unnecessary compliance and reporting costs, and allow electric utilities to demonstrate progress toward meeting energy assistance needs by leveraging multiple public and private funding sources.</p>
<p>The legislature intends to protect electric ratepayers by clarifying that a utility's obligation under this section is limited to addressing the energy assistance need associated with electricity use provided by that utility, and not the costs of other household energy sources or fuels that are not part of the utility's electric service.</p>
<p>It is further the intent of the legislature to preserve local and regulatory rate-making authority while encouraging flexible, cost-effective, and coordinated approaches that maximize the amount of assistance delivered to low-income households and minimize the administrative and financial burden on utilities and their customers.</p>
