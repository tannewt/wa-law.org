# HB 2266 - Supportive & emerg. housing

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2266-S.E.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that Washington state faces an acute shortage of housing affordable to households at all income levels, resulting in housing insecurity and a growing number of people experiencing homelessness. The legislature further finds that local regulatory barriers, inconsistent siting standards, and discretionary review processes have constrained the timely development of permanent supportive housing, transitional housing, indoor emergency housing, and indoor emergency shelters. It is the intent of the legislature to increase housing supply and advance fair housing by requiring these housing types to be permitted in urban areas on the same terms as other types of lodging and residential development, subject only to objective and nondiscriminatory development standards necessary to protect public health and safety. By streamlining permitting processes and ensuring consistent treatment across jurisdictions, the legislature intends to avoid unnecessary cost increases associated with delays and to facilitate the prompt delivery of safe, dignified, and stable housing and to support statewide efforts to address homelessness and the housing crisis.

3. Except as provided in subsections (5) through (7) of this section, a county or city shall only apply the same development permit and environmental review processes to transitional housing, permanent supportive housing, indoor emergency shelters, and indoor emergency housing that apply to other types of lodging or residential development within the same zone, unless otherwise required by state law including, but not limited to, shoreline regulations under chapter 90.58 RCW, building codes under chapter 19.27 RCW, energy codes under chapter 19.27A RCW, or electrical codes under chapter 19.28 RCW.
