# HB 2266 - Supportive & emerg. housing

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2266-S.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that Washington state faces an acute shortage of housing affordable to households at all income levels, resulting in housing insecurity and a growing number of people experiencing homelessness. The legislature further finds that local regulatory barriers, inconsistent siting standards, and discretionary review processes have constrained the timely development of permanent supportive housing, transitional housing, indoor emergency housing, and indoor emergency shelters. It is the intent of the legislature to increase housing supply and advance fair housing by requiring these housing types to be permitted in urban areas on the same terms as other types of lodging and residential development, subject only to objective and nondiscriminatory development standards necessary to protect public health and safety. By streamlining permitting processes and ensuring consistent treatment across jurisdictions, the legislature intends to avoid unnecessary cost increases associated with delays and to facilitate the prompt delivery of safe, dignified, and stable housing and to support statewide efforts to address homelessness and the housing crisis.

## Section 2
1. [Empty]

    a. A county or city planning under RCW 36.70A.040 must allow:

        ii. Indoor emergency shelters and indoor emergency housing in any zones within an urban growth area in which hotels are allowed. Nothing in this subsection allows a county or city to limit indoor emergency shelters and indoor emergency housing in a manner where the capacity of indoor emergency shelters and indoor emergency housing is insufficient to meet the projected needs identified under RCW 36.70A.070(2)(a)(ii). A county or city must allow indoor emergency shelters and indoor emergency housing in additional types of zones when necessary to meet projected needs identified in RCW 36.70A.070(2)(a)(ii).

    b. A county or city may not require transitional housing, permanent supportive housing, indoor emergency housing, and indoor emergency shelters to be located in a zone within an urban growth area zoned for industrial use.

2. Except as provided in subsections (5) and (6) of this section, a county or city may not require through development regulations, ordinances, or legal agreements any standards, conditions, or requirements for transitional housing, permanent supportive housing, indoor emergency housing, and indoor emergency shelters that are more restrictive than those required for other types of lodging and residential development within the same zone, but may apply any objective development regulations, including form-based codes, that are required for residential development including, but not limited to, setback, lot coverage, stormwater, clearing, and tree canopy and retention requirements.

3. A county or city shall only apply the same development permit and environmental review processes to transitional housing, permanent supportive housing, indoor emergency shelters, and indoor emergency housing that apply to other types of lodging and residential development within the same zone, unless otherwise required by state law including, but not limited to, shoreline regulations under chapter 90.58 RCW, building codes under chapter 19.27 RCW, energy codes under chapter 19.27A RCW, or electrical codes under chapter 19.28 RCW.

4. If applying design review for transitional housing, permanent supportive housing, indoor emergency shelters, and indoor emergency housing, only administrative design review may be required.

5. [Empty]

    a. For an indoor emergency shelter or indoor emergency housing, a county or city may require the sponsor or managing agency to certify in writing that it has, between the date the permit application was approved and the date the certificate of occupancy was issued:

        ii. Conducted no more than one community meeting;

        iii. Designated at least one point of contact and provide at least one telephone number to be used in emergencies; and

        iv. Provided documentation of the sponsor's or managing agency's operational policies or procedures for health, fire, safety, and occupancy.

    b. The written certification by the sponsor or managing entity constitutes full compliance with (a) of this subsection. A county or city may not require the sponsor or managing agency to provide additional certifications outside of what is allowed under (a) of this subsection (5) or to repeat or revise any of the items in (a)(i) through (iv) of this subsection (5). Nothing in this subsection (b) prohibits the sponsor or managing agency from voluntarily updating any of the information submitted under (a)(i) through (iv) of this subsection (5).

6. Nothing in this section requires a city or county to approve a permit application for permanent supportive housing, transitional housing, indoor emergency housing, or indoor emergency shelters that are proposed in a critical area in which no residential development is permitted, an area of natural hazards that generally prohibit residential development, or on agricultural, forest, or mineral lands of long-term commercial significance.
