## Section 1

    b. A pet insurer utilizing a waiting period permitted in (a) of this subsection shall include a provision in its policy that allows the waiting periods to be waived upon completion of a medical examination. Pet insurers may require the examination to be conducted by a licensed veterinarian after the purchase of the policy.
