# HB 2065 - Reducing administrative staffing at institutions of higher education.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2065.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that higher education is one of the great equalizers for reducing inequality, but the cost of a college education has exploded making higher education less accessible to lower class and middle class families. In support of our public institutions, the legislature has provided extensive financial support, including recently dedicating an entire tax stream to the state's colleges. Because these institutions receive public funds, the legislature and state taxpayers expect that they deliver an education that is both high quality and cost-effective. However, the legislature finds that alarming growth in administrative bureaucracy has made higher education less affordable for families and more expensive to taxpayers.

The legislature further finds that since 1994, the faculty-to-student ratio increased 60 percent while the administrator-to-student ratio increased by 245 percent. The legislature finds that institutional priorities over the past decade have been excessively focused on services that occur outside the classroom. The burgeoning administrative bureaucracy and related costs have unnecessarily increased the cost of higher education and are not aligned with the mission of delivering a high quality and cost-effective education. Therefore, the legislature intends for institutions to reduce their administrator-to-student ratios to 2008 levels, the high water mark prior to the great recession. In doing so, the legislature will generate millions of dollars of savings to taxpayers and will reduce the cost of a degree, making college more accessible and affordable for all Washington families.

## Section 2
1. By June 30, 2025, each state institution of higher education shall reduce the number of nonfaculty exempt employees to a number that is no greater than the amount reflected by the ratio of full-time equivalent nonfaculty exempt employees employed by the institution in fiscal year 2008, to full-time equivalent enrollments served by the institution in fiscal year 2008, multiplied by the number of full-time equivalent enrollments served by the institution in fiscal year 2024. By this method, the number of full-time equivalent nonfaculty exempt employees per full-time equivalent student will be no greater than the institution employed in 2008.
