[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1258-S.E.pdf)

## Section 1
1. A county located east of the crest of the Cascade mountains with a population between 530,000 and 1,500,000 receiving tax revenues under this chapter that operates a regional 911 emergency communications system must transfer a portion of the tax revenues received under this chapter to the corresponding local government operating a municipal public safety answering point or receiving calls transferred from the regional 911 emergency communications system for disposition and dispatch. The portion of the tax to be transferred by a county operating a regional 911 communications system must be calculated as follows:

    a. The portion of the tax transferred to the local government operating a municipal public safety answering point must be equal to the amount of the tax imposed under this chapter sourced to that local government's taxing jurisdiction.

    b. Until the department has the ability to apportion the taxes imposed under this chapter as directed in subsection (1)(a) of this section, the portion of the tax transferred to the local government operating a municipal public safety answering point must be the same percentage as the city receives for the tax imposed pursuant to RCW 82.14.450.

2. The amount calculated in subsection (1) of this section must be transferred quarterly by the county operating the regional 911 emergency communications system to the corresponding local government operating a municipal public safety answering point or receiving calls transferred from the regional 911 emergency communications system to a municipal public safety answering point for disposition and dispatch for the quarter.

3. For the purposes of this section, "regional 911 emergency communications system" means a 911 emergency communications system operated by a county that is responsible for receiving incoming 911 emergency calls for multiple local government law enforcement and fire response agencies.
