<p>&quot;Electric-assisted bicycle&quot; means a bicycle with two or three wheels, a saddle, fully operative pedals for human propulsion, and an electric motor. The electric-assisted bicycle's electric motor must have a power output of no more than 750 watts. The electric-assisted bicycle must meet the requirements of one of the following three classifications:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Class 1 electric-assisted bicycle&quot; means an electric-assisted bicycle in which the motor provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling and ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches the speed of 20 miles per hour;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Class 2 electric-assisted bicycle&quot; means an electric-assisted bicycle in which the motor may be used exclusively to propel the bicycle and is not capable of providing assistance when the bicycle reaches the speed of 20 miles per hour; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Class 3 electric-assisted bicycle&quot; means an electric-assisted bicycle in which the motor provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling and ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches the speed of 28 miles per hour and is equipped with a speedometer.</p>

<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes the recent proliferation of electric motorcycle use statewide, especially among teenagers and young adults. The legislature also recognizes that there is a growing need to focus on the differences between electric-assisted bicycles and electric motorcycles to provide a clear means of distinguishing between the regulations that apply to each type of vehicle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The department of licensing must convene a work group to study and recommend: (i) Whether additional training or other investments could assist with uniform and consistent enforcement of rules of the road and equipment requirements applicable to all types of electric motorcycles; and (ii) whether consumer protections related to a consumer's ability to distinguish between electric bicycles and electric motorcycles would facilitate adherence to the laws applicable to each category of vehicle. The department may contract with a third-party consultant for work group support and to make recommendations on potential changes to state law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The work group must consist of, but is not limited to, the following members:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The secretary of the department of transportation or the secretary's designee;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The work group must address the following topics:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Enforcement of motorcycle rules of the road and equipment requirements as applied to all types of electric motorcycles, including whether any category of electric motorcycles may not be subject to consistent enforcement across the state, and if not, how enforcement could be made more consistent across all types of electric motorcycles;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vehicle modifications that impact vehicle classification and may require vehicle reclassification, potential vehicle marketing practice and disclosure requirements related to vehicle classification that could assist consumers in distinguishing between electric-assisted bicycles and electric motorcycles, and any penalties that would be appropriate for violations of these requirements; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any additional areas of focus the work group finds relevant to the objective of the assessment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The work group must submit a final report, including any recommendations or draft legislation, to the office of the governor and transportation committees of the legislature by December 15, 2026.</p>
