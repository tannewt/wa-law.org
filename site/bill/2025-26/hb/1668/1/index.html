<ol>
<li>
<p>An inmate in community custody who willfully discontinues making himself or herself available to the department for supervision by making his or her whereabouts unknown or by failing to maintain contact with the department as directed by the community corrections officer shall be deemed an escapee and fugitive from justice, and upon conviction shall be guilty of a class C felony under chapter 9A.20 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must exercise discretion when deciding to recommend to the prosecuting authority the charging of escape from community custody under this section, including not recommending a charge for every instance of an individual failing to make themselves available to the department, but considering the severity of the circumstances and prioritizing the recommendation of charging in more egregious instances, such as when the individual poses a substantial risk to public safety or when the individual has willfully absconded for a prolonged period or under concerning circumstances.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Within five days of the department's issuance of an arrest warrant for an individual under community custody who has absconded from community supervision or violated any other community custody conditions, community corrections officers must undertake all reasonable efforts to ascertain the whereabouts of and apprehend the individual subject to the warrant including coordinating with department liaisons as provided for in subsection (2) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the department community corrections division must create a liaison position to foster relationships between the division's field offices and local law enforcement agencies, in order to support local law enforcement assistance in apprehending supervised individuals who have a department warrant. The division must also develop and implement a mechanism for information sharing between the department and local law enforcement agencies to facilitate the ability of local law enforcement to assist in looking for and apprehending individuals subject to a warrant. The focus of the department's local law enforcement partnership and data sharing shall be on apprehending supervised individuals who pose a substantial risk to public safety or who have willfully absconded for a prolonged period of time or under concerning circumstances.</p>
