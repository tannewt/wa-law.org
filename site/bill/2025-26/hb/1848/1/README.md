# HB 1848 - Traumatic brain injuries

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1848.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that individuals living with traumatic brain injuries face significant barriers to accessing necessary support services, community integration programs, and peer-led recovery opportunities. The legislature acknowledges that traumatic brain injuries can lead to long-term cognitive, emotional, and physical challenges, often resulting in social isolation, difficulty in maintaining employment, and limited access to rehabilitation services. Additionally, family members and caregivers of individuals with a traumatic brain injury require ongoing support and guidance to navigate the complexities of available resources. Recent trends indicate that allocations have disproportionately favored virtual education and state-affiliated programs, leaving direct peer-to-peer groups and community-based support underfunded. The disappearance of many in-person support groups, due to financial constraints, has severely limited opportunities for individuals with a traumatic brain injury to connect, build essential life skills, and engage in meaningful recovery-focused activities.

The legislature recognizes the urgent need to rebalance funding priorities to ensure that in-person support groups and community integration programs are adequately supported. To further facilitate community integration and education, the legislature finds that an annual conference should be sponsored by the traumatic brain injury council to bring together survivors, caregivers, professionals, and community members. This conference will serve as a platform for knowledge-sharing, networking, and collaboration on traumatic brain injury research, rehabilitation, and support services.

The public awareness campaign shall also include information on the availability and benefits of in-person peer support groups, community integration programs, and other services designed to assist individuals with traumatic brain injuries and their families.

2. In addition to existing public awareness efforts, the council shall sponsor an annual statewide traumatic brain injury conference. This event must provide opportunities for education, networking, and collaboration among survivors, caregivers, medical professionals, and community organizations to improve knowledge of traumatic brain injury issues and available resources.

## Section 4
1. The department shall provide funding from the traumatic brain injury account established by RCW 74.31.060 to programs that facilitate support groups to individuals with traumatic brain injuries and their families.

3. At least 30 percent of the annual expenditures from the traumatic brain injury account must be allocated to in-person support groups and community integration activities. The department shall ensure that funds dedicated to in-person support groups, the expansion of structured programs that facilitate direct peer-to-peer connection for individuals and family members impacted by traumatic brain injuries, and community integration programs prioritize peer engagement and are not disproportionately allocated to virtual-only support structures or other department-affiliated programs that do not. The council shall review and approve annual funding proposals for in-person support and community integration programs to ensure transparency and adherence to legislative intent. The department shall make every effort to disburse the incremental revenue that is the result of the fee under RCW 46.63.110(7)(c) or federal funds under RCW 74.31.060(2) in a diverse manner to include rural areas of the state.

4. The department shall allocate a portion of funding from the traumatic brain injury account to support the planning and execution of an annual traumatic brain injury conference. The council shall provide recommendations on the content, structures, and speakers to ensure a comprehensive approach that includes survivor experiences, professional training, and policy discussions.

## Section 5
1. The traumatic brain injury account is created in the state treasury. The fee imposed under RCW 46.63.110(7)(c) must be deposited into the account. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation, and may be used only to support the activities in the statewide traumatic brain injury comprehensive plan, to provide a public awareness campaign and services relating to traumatic brain injury under RCW 74.31.040 and 74.31.050, for information and referral services, and for costs of required department staff who are providing support for the council under RCW 74.31.020 and 74.31.030. Additionally, at least 30 percent of the annual expenditures from the account must be for in-person support groups and community integration activities that promote social connections between individuals impacted by traumatic brain injury. The secretary of the department of social and health services shall administer the funds in alignment with the priorities outlined in this section and ensure compliance with all allocation requirements. The department must make every effort to disburse the incremental revenue that is the result of the fee increased under RCW 46.63.110(7)(c) in a diverse manner to include rural areas of the state.

2. The department shall proactively seek, apply for, and secure federal funding opportunities, including but not limited to grants available through the administration for community living and other federal programs. These efforts shall be conducted in coordination with the council and in alignment with the council's mission and priorities. Federal funds obtained pursuant to this subsection shall supplement the fee amounts collected pursuant to RCW 46.63.110(7)(c) and shall be deposited into the traumatic brain injury account. The department shall ensure that any federal funds received enhance, rather than supplant, existing state funding dedicated to in-person support groups, community integration activities, and peer-to-peer recovery initiatives.

3. A minimum of 30 percent of the annual fee revenue collected under RCW 46.63.110(7)(c) shall be used exclusively for:

However, funds for the conference shall not be drawn from the 30 percent allocation specified in subsection (3) of this section.
