<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that individuals living with traumatic brain injuries face significant barriers to accessing necessary support services, community integration programs, and peer-led recovery opportunities. The legislature acknowledges that traumatic brain injuries can lead to long-term cognitive, emotional, and physical challenges, often resulting in social isolation, difficulty in maintaining employment, and limited access to rehabilitation services. Additionally, family members and caregivers of individuals with a traumatic brain injury require ongoing support and guidance to navigate the complexities of available resources. Recent trends indicate that allocations have disproportionately favored virtual education and state-affiliated programs, leaving direct peer-to-peer groups and community-based support underfunded. The disappearance of many in-person support groups, due to financial constraints, has severely limited opportunities for individuals with a traumatic brain injury to connect, build essential life skills, and engage in meaningful recovery-focused activities.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes the urgent need to rebalance funding priorities to ensure that in-person support groups and community integration programs are adequately supported.</p>

<p>In collaboration with the council, the department shall conduct a public awareness campaign that utilizes funding from the traumatic brain injury account to leverage a private advertising campaign to persuade Washington residents to be aware and concerned about the issues facing individuals with traumatic brain injuries through all forms of media including internet, television, radio, and print. The public awareness campaign must also include information on the availability and benefits of in-person peer support groups, community integration programs, and other services designed to assist individuals with traumatic brain injuries and their families.</p>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>

The department shall ensure that funds dedicated to in-person support groups, the expansion of structured programs that facilitate direct peer-to-peer connection for individuals and family members impacted by traumatic brain injuries, and community integration programs prioritize peer engagement and are not disproportionately allocated to virtual-only support structures or other department-affiliated programs that do not. The council shall review and approve annual funding proposals for in-person support and community integration programs to ensure transparency and adherence to legislative intent. The department shall make every effort to disburse the incremental revenue that is the result of the fee under RCW 46.63.110(7)(c) or federal funds under RCW 74.31.060(2) in a diverse manner to include rural areas of the state.</p>

<li>
<p>The traumatic brain injury account is created in the state treasury. The fee imposed under RCW 46.63.110(7)(c) must be deposited into the account. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation, and may be used only to support the activities in the statewide traumatic brain injury comprehensive plan, to provide a public awareness campaign and services relating to traumatic brain injury under RCW 74.31.040 and 74.31.050, for information and referral services, and for costs of required department staff who are providing support for the council under RCW 74.31.020 and 74.31.030. Additionally, at least 30 percent of the annual expenditures from the account must be for in-person support groups and community integration activities that promote social connections between individuals impacted by traumatic brain injury. The secretary of the department of social and health services shall administer the funds in alignment with the priorities outlined in this section and ensure compliance with all allocation requirements.
