## Section 201
1. The legislature finds that public education is a cornerstone of a healthy, diverse, and productive society.

2. Article IX of the state Constitution requires the state to make ample provision for the education of all children residing within its borders.

3. In recognition of the role that public education can play in providing students with information about their rights and about how to employ their rights for the betterment of education and society, the legislature intends to require each school district, charter school, and state-tribal education compact school to develop student-focused educational and promotional materials, for communication and classroom use, that incorporate the statement of student rights established in section 202 of this act.

## Section 203
1. [Empty]

    a. Beginning with or before the 2020-21 school year, each school district that operates a high school must provide a mandatory one-half credit stand-alone course in civics for each high school student. Except as provided by (c) of this subsection, civics content and instruction embedded in other social studies courses do not satisfy the requirements of this subsection.

    b. Credit awarded to students who complete the civics course must be applied to course credit requirements in social studies that are required for high school graduation.

    c. Civics content and instruction required by this section may be embedded in social studies courses that offer students the opportunity to earn both high school and postsecondary credit.

The materials and resources must be posted on the office of the superintendent of public instruction's website.

## Section 204
Sections 201 through 203 of this act may be known and cited as the statement of student rights act.

## Section 301
1. The legislature acknowledges and supports the importance of local control for school district governance. Local school boards and superintendents are in the best position to effectively and quickly respond to the needs of their communities. However, local control is not absolute and must also be balanced against the need to ensure all students have access to a healthy, safe learning environment that celebrates and protects their diversity and civil rights. There are certain areas of state law that are critically important to ensuring every student has equal access to this type of supportive and responsive learning environment.

2. The legislature is aware that some school districts are intentionally not complying with certain requirements in state law and that this noncompliance is negatively impacting students. School board members and superintendents are uniquely responsible for ensuring that their school district is in compliance with those state laws and members of the school district should have a mechanism to hold those individuals accountable if state laws are not followed.

3. The legislature therefore intends to establish a complaint process for students, parents, and community members to address willful noncompliance with certain state laws that are necessary for protecting the health, safety, and civil rights of students in order to ensure every student has access to a positive learning environment.

## Section 302
Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout sections 303 through 305 of this act.

1. "Broad complaint" means a complaint that impacts an entire student body, an entire subgroup of students within a student body, an entire school, or an entire school district.

2. "Limited complaint" means a complaint that impacts one or more individual students.

3. "Negligent" means the failure to exercise ordinary care by a local school district superintendent, a local school district board of directors, or an individual member or members of a board of directors, and the actor knew or reasonably should have known that the failure to exercise ordinary care would result in noncompliance with state law as defined in this section.

4. "Noncompliance with state law" means action or inaction by a local school district superintendent, a local school district board of directors, or an individual member or members of a board of directors, that results in noncompliance with the following state laws, which are intended to ensure academic rights and protections for students in the educational environment:

    a. State civil rights and nondiscrimination, including the nondiscrimination and sexual equality laws and model policy and procedure requirements related to protecting students' rights as established in chapters 28A.640 and 28A.642 RCW;

    b. "Harassment, intimidation, or bullying" requirements as established in RCW 28A.600.477;

    c. Curriculum requirements as described in RCW 28A.150.230, 28A.300.475, and 28A.320.170; the policies and procedures related to the selection or deletion of instructional materials required in RCW 28A.320.230; and the review and removal of supplemental instructional materials required in RCW 28A.320.235;

Before submitting the compliance action plan to the office of the superintendent of public instruction for approval, the school district board of directors must hold a public meeting to present the proposed compliance action plan to the community and allow for public comment on the proposed plan.

The compliance action plan must be developed in collaboration with the office of the superintendent of public instruction. In developing the compliance action plan, the school district must provide school district administrators, teachers, and other staff, parents of children attending a school within the school district, unions representing employees within the school district, students from the school district, and other impacted communities as appropriate with an opportunity to provide input on the development of the plan.

    c. Before submitting the compliance action plan to the office of the superintendent of public instruction for approval, the school district board of directors must hold a public meeting to present the proposed compliance action plan to the community and allow for public comment on the proposed plan.

If a school district neither publishes a handbook nor maintains a website, it must provide the model student handbook language developed under subsection (1) of this section to each student, parent, employee, and volunteer at least annually.

## Section 309
1. The Washington professional educator standards board must adopt rules that make a local school district superintendent's or chief administrator's willful noncompliance with state law an act of unprofessional conduct and provide that a superintendent or chief administrator, whether certificated or not, may be held accountable for such conduct under rules established under this section. It is a defense to a finding of willful noncompliance with state law if the superintendent or chief administrator can show that they were actively attempting to bring the school district, charter school, or state-tribal education compact school into compliance with the applicable state law.

2. For the purposes of this section, "willful" and "noncompliance with state law" have the same meaning as in section 302 of this act.
