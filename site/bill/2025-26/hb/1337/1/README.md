## Section 1
The legislature recognizes that the hiring of presidents at public institutions of higher education is a matter of public interest. To further this interest, the legislature intends to ensure that the top leadership of Washington's public institutions of higher education is selected in a manner that reflects principles of academic partnership with faculty, staff, and students, includes opportunities for input from members of the public, and complies with the open public meetings act.

## Section 2
1. The governing board of each respective institution of higher education shall appoint the institution's president in accordance with the following provisions:

    a. The governing board shall provide public notice for up to four priority candidates for the position of president of their respective institution. Public notice must be provided at least 30 days prior to the date of the public meeting of the governing board at which a final action or vote is to be taken on the employment of a priority candidate. The public meeting must be an open public meeting in compliance with the open public meetings act pursuant to chapter 42.30 RCW. A priority candidate's employment application, resume, reference letters, and school transcripts must be made available with the public notice; and

    b. Prior to the public meeting and after public notice is provided pursuant to (a) of this subsection, the governing board shall provide a public forum at the institution's campus for the priority candidates for the position of president of the institution to provide the public, including the media and students, faculty, and staff of the institution, with an opportunity to meet and ask questions or provide input regarding the priority candidates.

2. For purposes of this section, "priority candidate" means an individual preliminarily selected to fill a vacancy in a position appointed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section.

## Section 3
This act is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, or support of the state government and its existing public institutions, and takes effect immediately.
