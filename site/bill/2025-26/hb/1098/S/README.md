## Section 7
Counties receiving funds from the county local road trust account shall provide such matching funds as established by rules adopted by the board. Matching requirements must be established after appropriate studies by the board, taking into account financial resources available to counties.

## Section 8
1. Only those counties that, during the preceding 12 months, have spent all revenues collected for road purposes only for such purposes, including removal of barriers to fish passage and accompanying streambed and stream bank repair as specified in RCW 36.82.070, and including traffic law enforcement as allowed under Article II, section 40 of the state Constitution or RCW 36.82.070(2), are eligible to receive funds from the county local road trust account, except that:

    a. Counties with a population of less than 8,000 are exempt from this eligibility restriction;

    b. Counties expending revenues collected for road purposes only on other governmental services after authorization from the voters of that county under RCW 84.55.050 are exempt from this eligibility restriction; and

2. The board shall authorize county local road trust account funds for the construction project portion of a project previously authorized for a preliminary proposal in the sequence in which the preliminary proposal has been completed and the construction project is to be placed under contract. At such time the board may reserve county local road trust account funds for expenditure in future years as may be necessary for completion of preliminary proposals and construction projects to be commenced in the ensuing biennium.

3. The board may, within the constraints of available county local road trust account funds, consider additional projects for authorization upon a clear and conclusive showing by the submitting county that the proposed project is of an emergent nature and that its need was unable to be anticipated at the time the six-year program of the county was developed. The proposed projects must be evaluated on the basis of the priority rating factors specified in section 4 of this act.

## Section 9
Whenever the board approves a county local road program project it shall determine the amount of county local road trust account funds to be allocated for such project. The allocation must be based upon information submitted by the county seeking approval of the project and upon such further investigation as the board deems necessary. The board shall adopt reasonable rules pursuant to which county local road trust account funds allocated to a project may be increased upon a subsequent application of the county constructing the project. The rules adopted by the board must take into account, but are not limited to, the following factors:

1. The financial effect of increasing the original allocation for the project upon other county local road program projects either approved or requested;

2. Whether the project for which an additional allocation is requested can be reduced in scope while retaining a usable segment;

3. Whether the original cost of the project shown in the applicant's original submittal was based upon reasonable engineering estimates; and

4. Whether the requested additional allocation is to pay for an expansion in the scope of work originally approved.
