## Section 1
1. [Empty]

    a. The governor may enter into compacts with tribes concerning revenue collected by the state from the state sales tax, state use tax, and certain state business and occupation taxes, to the extent these taxes are imposed on qualified transactions. All compacts must meet the requirements under this section.

    b. [Empty]

        i. Except with regard to the terms of a compacting tribe's qualified capital investment, the governor may delegate the authority to negotiate compacts to the department.

        ii. In negotiating the terms of a compacting tribe's qualified capital investment, the governor must be satisfied that the compacting tribe's qualified capital investment is substantially proportionate to the compacting tribe's estimated tax revenue under the compact as compared to qualified capital investments contained in other compacts. For purposes of estimating a compacting tribe's tax revenue under a compact, tax revenue from new development is not included in the estimate.

2.

    a. One hundred percent of certain state business and occupation tax revenues;

    b. The first $500,000 of the total amount of state sales tax and state use tax collected during each calendar year from taxpayers, regardless of whether the taxpayers meet the requirements of a new development. If this $500,000 cap is reached during a calendar year, any amounts collected from taxpayers that do not meet the requirements of a new development will be deemed to have been collected and applied to the cap first, but only in the calendar month in which the cap is reached;

    c. The following amounts of state sales tax and state use tax collected during each calendar year from taxpayers meeting the requirements of a new development:

        i. Twenty-five percent of any amount over the cap described in (b) of this subsection (2); or

        ii. One hundred percent of any amount over the cap described in (b) of this subsection (2), if the compacting tribe has completed a qualified capital investment; and

    d. Beginning January 1st of the fourth calendar year following the  compact's effective date, the following amounts of state sales tax and state use tax collected during each calendar year from taxpayers that do not meet the requirements of a new development:

        i. Twenty-five percent of any amount over the cap described in (b) of this subsection (2); or

        ii. One hundred percent of any amount over the cap described in (b) of this subsection (2), if the compacting tribe has completed a qualified capital investment.

3. The parties to any compact must agree to include the following provisions in the compact:

    a. A process for determining when any qualified capital investment is complete;

    b. A process to verify compliance with the terms of the compact;

    c. A delineation of the respective roles and responsibilities of the compacting tribe and the department;

    d. A process to resolve disputes, including the use of a nonjudicial process;

    e. An agreement that the compact resolves all current and future disputes between the compacting tribe and state and local taxing authorities, while the compact is in effect, to the extent such disputes relate to the levying, assessment, and collection of taxes related to the following:

        i. Transactions between nonmembers, where such transactions are subject to any state sales tax, local sales tax, and any other taxes in effect or authorized as of June 11, 2020, except for any business and occupation tax under chapter 82.04 RCW other than certain state business and occupation taxes;

        ii. State and local use tax imposed on nonmembers and sourced to a location within the Indian country of the compacting tribe pursuant to RCW 82.32.730; and

        iii. State and local personal property taxes imposed on nonmembers;

        i. The parties must discuss in good faith any changes in the compact or this section that may be appropriate to preserve the intended benefits of the compact; and

        ii. A compacting tribe may terminate the compact if the good faith discussions do not result in a mutually satisfactory resolution;

    g. [Empty]

        i. An agreement that the department must perform all functions related to the administration and collection of the taxes collected on qualified transactions. The department may not impose any charge on a compacting tribe for these services. However, the department may seek legislative appropriations to cover its administrative costs associated with compact negotiations and administration.

        ii. As part of the department's authority under (g)(i) of this subsection (3), the department will apply the provisions contained in Title 82 RCW insofar as they are applicable to the taxes at issue in any compact authorized under this section;

    h. An agreement that the compacting tribe will provide information the department determines is necessary to fulfill the department's tax administration obligations under the compact, including information related to parcel ownership and business operations in the compact covered area; and

        i. Terms specifying the duration of the compact, and any related terms.

    a. A compacting tribe may examine department records related to the payment of tax amounts to the compacting tribe.
