<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that individuals referred for services related to competency to stand trial requiring admission into a psychiatric facility are experiencing significantly reduced wait times for competency services. In order to preserve these critical gains, for the benefit of the state and those individuals awaiting services, the legislature finds that implementing measures to reduce the continued growth of referrals to the competency system are necessary. The state's forensic bed capacity forecast model indicates that if the state continues to receive competency referrals from local superior, district, and municipal courts at the same volume, the state will again fall behind.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that historical investments and policy changes have been made in behavioral health services over the past several years, designed to both increase capacity to provide competency to stand trial services and to reduce the need for them by creating opportunities for diversion, prevention, and improved community health. New construction at western state hospital has resulted in the opening of 58 forensic psychiatric beds in the first quarter of 2023, while emergency community hospital contracts expanded to allow for the discharge or transfer of over 50 civil conversion patients occupying forensic state hospital beds over the same period. Sixteen beds for civil conversion patients opened at Maple Lane school in the first quarter of 2023, with 30 additional beds for patients acquitted by reason of insanity opened in early 2024. The state also acquired a new facility in 2024, now known as Olympic Heritage behavioral health, which added to this historic rise in bed capacity in the state of Washington. Over a longer time period, 350 forensic beds are planned to open within a new forensic hospital on the western state hospital campus between 2028 and 2029. Policy and budget changes have increased capacity for assisted outpatient treatment, 988 crisis response, use of medication for opioid use disorders in jails and community settings, reentry services, and mental health advance directives, and created new behavioral health facility types, supportive housing, and supportive employment services. Forensic navigator services, outpatient competency restoration programs, clinical intervention specialists and other specialty forensic services are now available and continuing to be deployed in phase one, two, and three Trueblood settlement regions.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that these investments over a period of many years have made significant improvements in the wait times for competency services. Even so, there remains a need for everyone to come together to find solutions to both reduce demand for forensic services and shrink the number of individuals whose only access to behavioral health care is through the criminal justice system. Forensic services should be reserved only for those where the state's interest is sufficient to justify the detention and greater efforts are needed to prevent or divert individuals with behavioral health needs from being unnecessarily incarcerated. The state needs collaboration from local governments and other entities to provide and develop services and supports to patients connected to the forensic system, to reduce the flow of competency referrals coming from municipal, district, and superior courts, and to improve availability and effectiveness of behavioral health services provided outside the criminal justice system.</p>

<p>Except as otherwise provided in this section, if the defendant is charged with a felony and determined to be incompetent, until he or she has regained the competency necessary to understand the proceedings against him or her and assist in his or her own defense, but in any event for a period of no longer than 90 days, the court shall commit the defendant to the custody of the secretary for inpatient competency restoration, or may alternatively order the defendant to receive outpatient competency restoration based on a recommendation from a forensic navigator and input from the parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a defendant who is determined to be incompetent and whose highest charge is a class C felony other than assault in the third degree under RCW 9A.36.031(1) (d) or (f), felony physical control of a vehicle under RCW 46.61.504(6), felony hit and run resulting in injury under RCW 46.52.020(4)(b), a hate crime offense under RCW 9A.36.080, a class C felony with a domestic violence designation, a class C felony sex offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030, or a class C felony with a sexual motivation allegation, the court shall first consider all available and appropriate alternatives to inpatient competency restoration. The court shall dismiss the proceedings without prejudice upon agreement of the parties if the forensic navigator has found an appropriate and available diversion program willing to accept the defendant. If the parties do not agree that there is an appropriate diversion program available to accept the defendant:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The court shall dismiss the proceedings without prejudice and order that the defendant be referred for evaluation for civil commitment under subsection (7) of this section, unless the prosecutor objects to the dismissal and provides notice of a motion for an order for competency restoration treatment, in which case the court shall schedule a hearing within seven days. The prosecutor shall provide notice of the objection and motion for an order of competency restoration treatment to the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The prosecuting attorney shall inquire into and make a full examination of all the facts and circumstances regarding whether there is a compelling state interest in pursuing competency restoration. This must include a review of any history that suggests the likelihood of success for competency restoration. Upon examination and prior to the hearing the prosecuting attorney shall file a statement regarding whether there is a compelling state interest in pursuing competency restoration. The statement must include relevant information related to the state's interest in continuing the prosecution of the charges including whether doing so serves the interests of justice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the hearing, the prosecuting attorney must establish that there is a compelling state interest to order competency restoration treatment for the defendant. The court must consider the statement of the prosecuting attorney and any history that suggests whether competency restoration treatment is likely to be successful. The court also may consider prior criminal history, prior history in treatment, prior history of violence, or the quality and severity of the pending charges, in addition to the factors listed under RCW 10.77.092. If the defendant is subject to an order under chapter 71.05 RCW or proceedings under chapter 71.05 RCW have been initiated, or the court determines based on history that competency restoration is unlikely to be successful, there is a rebuttable presumption that there is no compelling state interest in ordering competency restoration treatment. If the prosecuting attorney proves by a preponderance of the evidence that there is a compelling state interest in ordering competency restoration treatment, then the court shall issue an order for either outpatient or inpatient competency restoration in accordance with this section.</p>

<pre><code>b. If the court orders inpatient competency restoration, the department shall place the defendant in an appropriate facility of the department for competency restoration.

c. For a defendant ordered to inpatient competency restoration, the department shall promptly notify the court and parties whenever it appears the defendant's condition is such that a transfer to outpatient competency restoration is appropriate. Any such notice to the court and parties shall provide pertinent information concerning the change in condition or the reasons supporting transfer to outpatient competency restoration. Upon receipt of this notice, the court shall schedule a hearing within 10 days to review the information provided by the department, conditions of release of the defendant, and anticipated release date from inpatient treatment. The court shall issue appropriate orders if it finds that the defendant's condition has so changed that they are a suitable candidate for outpatient competency restoration.

d. If the court orders outpatient competency restoration, the court shall modify conditions of release as needed to authorize the department to place the person in approved housing, which may include access to supported housing, affiliated with a contracted outpatient competency restoration program. The department, in conjunction with the health care authority, must establish rules for conditions of participation in the outpatient competency restoration program, which must include the defendant being subject to medication management. The court may order regular urinalysis testing. The outpatient competency restoration program shall monitor the defendant during the defendant's placement in the program and report any noncompliance or significant changes with respect to the defendant to the department and, if applicable, the forensic navigator.

e. If a defendant fails to comply with the restrictions of the outpatient competency restoration program such that restoration is no longer appropriate in that setting or the defendant is no longer clinically appropriate for outpatient competency restoration, the director of the outpatient competency restoration program shall notify the authority and the department of the need to terminate the outpatient competency restoration placement and intent to request placement for the defendant in an appropriate facility of the department for inpatient competency restoration. The outpatient competency restoration program shall coordinate with the authority, the department, and any law enforcement personnel under (e)(i) of this subsection to ensure that the time period between termination and admission into the inpatient facility is as minimal as possible. The time period for inpatient competency restoration shall be reduced by the time period spent in active treatment within the outpatient competency restoration program, excluding time periods in which the defendant was absent from the program and all time from notice of termination of the outpatient competency restoration period through the defendant's admission to the facility. The department shall obtain a placement for the defendant within seven days of the notice of intent to terminate the outpatient competency restoration placement.

    i. The department may authorize a peace officer to detain the defendant into emergency custody for transport to the designated inpatient competency restoration facility. If medical clearance is required by the designated competency restoration facility before admission, the peace officer must transport the defendant to a crisis stabilization unit, evaluation and treatment facility, or emergency department of a local hospital for medical clearance once a bed is available at the designated inpatient competency restoration facility. The signed outpatient competency restoration order of the court shall serve as authority for the detention of the defendant under this subsection. This subsection does not preclude voluntary transportation of the defendant to a facility for inpatient competency restoration or for medical clearance, or authorize admission of the defendant into jail.

    ii. The department shall notify the court and parties of the defendant's admission for inpatient competency restoration before the close of the next judicial day. The court shall schedule a hearing within five days to review the conditions of release of the defendant and anticipated release from treatment and issue appropriate orders.

f. The court may not issue an order for outpatient competency restoration unless the department certifies that there is an available appropriate outpatient competency restoration program that has adequate space for the person at the time the order is issued or the court places the defendant under the guidance and control of a professional person identified in the court order.

<p>If the court determines or the parties agree before the initial competency restoration period or at any subsequent stage of the proceedings that the defendant is unlikely to regain competency, the court may dismiss the charges without prejudice without ordering the defendant to undergo an initial or further period of competency restoration treatment, in which case the court shall order that the defendant be referred for evaluation for civil commitment in the manner provided in subsection (7) of this section.</p>

<p>On or before expiration of the initial competency restoration period the court shall conduct a hearing to determine whether the defendant is now competent to stand trial. If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant is incompetent to stand trial, the court may order an extension of the competency restoration period for an additional period of 90 days, but the court must at the same time set a date for a new hearing to determine the defendant's competency to stand trial before the expiration of this second restoration period. The defendant, the defendant's attorney, and the prosecutor have the right to demand that the hearing be before a jury. No extension shall be ordered for a second or third competency restoration period if the defendant is ineligible for a subsequent competency restoration period under subsection (4) of this section or the defendant's incompetence has been determined by the secretary to be solely the result of an intellectual or developmental disability, dementia, or traumatic brain injury which is such that competence is not reasonably likely to be regained during an extension.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>For purposes of determining whether a court may authorize involuntary medication for the purpose of competency restoration pursuant to RCW 10.77.084 and for maintaining the level of restoration in the jail following the restoration period, a pending charge involving any one or more of the following crimes is a serious offense per se in the context of competency restoration:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Any violent offense, sex offense, serious traffic offense, and most serious offense, as those terms are defined in RCW 9.94A.030;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any offense, except nonfelony counterfeiting offenses, included in crimes against persons in RCW 9.94A.411;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any offense contained in chapter 9.41 RCW (firearms and dangerous weapons);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any offense listed as domestic violence in RCW 10.99.020;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any offense listed as a harassment offense in chapter 9A.46 RCW, except for criminal trespass in the first or second degree;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any violation of chapter 69.50 RCW that is a class B felony; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any city or county ordinance or statute that is equivalent to an offense referenced in this subsection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any time a petition is filed seeking a court order authorizing the involuntary medication for purposes of competency restoration pursuant to RCW 10.77.084, the petition must also seek authorization to continue involuntary medication for purposes of maintaining the level of restoration in the jail or juvenile detention facility following the restoration period.</p>

<p>In a particular case, a court may determine that a pending charge not otherwise defined as serious by state or federal law or by a city or county ordinance is, nevertheless, a serious offense within the context of competency restoration treatment when the conduct in the charged offense falls within the standards established in (b) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To determine that the particular case is a serious offense within the context of competency restoration, the court must consider the following factors and determine that one or more of the following factors creates a situation in which the offense is serious:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The charge includes an allegation that the defendant actually inflicted bodily or emotional harm on another person or that the defendant created a reasonable apprehension of bodily or emotional harm to another;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The extent of the impact of the alleged offense on the basic human need for security of the citizens within the jurisdiction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number and nature of related charges pending against the defendant;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The length of potential confinement if the defendant is convicted; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of potential and actual victims or persons impacted by the defendant's alleged acts.</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a defendant ordered to inpatient competency restoration, the department shall promptly notify the court and parties whenever it appears the defendant's condition and amenability to treatment are such that an order for involuntary medication is necessary. Any such notice to the court and parties shall provide pertinent information concerning the applicable criteria under Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 123 S.Ct. 2174, 156 L.Ed.2d 197 (2003). Upon receipt of this notice, the court shall schedule a hearing within 10 days to consider an order for involuntary medication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For any hearing pertaining to involuntary medication, the parties, the witnesses, the interpreters, and the presiding judicial officer shall be present and participate by video. The term &quot;video,&quot; as used in this section, includes any functional equivalent. At any hearing conducted by video, the technology used must permit the judicial officer, counsel, all parties, and the witnesses to be able to see, hear, and speak, when authorized, during the hearing; to allow attorneys to use exhibits or other materials during the hearing; and to allow the respondent's counsel to be in the same location as the respondent unless otherwise requested by the respondent or the respondent's counsel. Witnesses in a proceeding may also appear in court through other means, including telephonically, pursuant to the requirements of superior court civil rule 43. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the court, upon its own motion or upon a motion for good cause by any party, may require some or all parties and witnesses to participate in the hearing in person rather than by video. In ruling on any such motion, the court may allow in-person or video testimony; and the court may consider, among other things, whether the respondent's alleged behavioral health disorder affects the respondent's ability to perceive or participate in the proceeding by video.</p>
