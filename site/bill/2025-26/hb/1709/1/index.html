<p>The legislature recognizes that not every public school has a full-time school nurse and that there are restrictions on who can provide nursing care, including medication administration, to students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further recognizes that parent-designated adults are volunteers, who may be school employees, and who provide care for the student consistent with the student's individual health plan. Legislation enacted in 2002 authorized parent-designated adults to provide care for students with diabetes. Legislation enacted in 2013 authorized parent-designated adults to provide care for students with seizure disorders, including epilepsy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that adrenal insufficiency is a rare condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol. If cortisol levels drop too low, which can happen when a person is stressed, ill, or injured, a person will experience abdominal pain, fatigue, dizziness, and ultimately go into shock. Acute severe adrenal insufficiency is a life-threatening situation that requires emergency treatment with cortisol or similar medication to prevent shock or other severe complications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to authorize parent-designated adults to provide care for students with adrenal insufficiency.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>A parent-designated adult may provide care for students with adrenal insufficiency, if needed. Requirements for parent-designated adult eligibility, limitations on supervision, and related provisions are provided in RCW 28A.210.260(1)(h).</p>
