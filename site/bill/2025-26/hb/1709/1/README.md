# HB 1709 - Adrenal insufficiency care

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1709.pdf)

## Section 1
1. [Empty]

    a. The legislature recognizes that not every public school has a full-time school nurse and that there are restrictions on who can provide nursing care, including medication administration, to students.

    b. The legislature further recognizes that parent-designated adults are volunteers, who may be school employees, and who provide care for the student consistent with the student's individual health plan. Legislation enacted in 2002 authorized parent-designated adults to provide care for students with diabetes. Legislation enacted in 2013 authorized parent-designated adults to provide care for students with seizure disorders, including epilepsy.

2. The legislature finds that adrenal insufficiency is a rare condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol. If cortisol levels drop too low, which can happen when a person is stressed, ill, or injured, a person will experience abdominal pain, fatigue, dizziness, and ultimately go into shock. Acute severe adrenal insufficiency is a life-threatening situation that requires emergency treatment with cortisol or similar medication to prevent shock or other severe complications.

3. Therefore, the legislature intends to authorize parent-designated adults to provide care for students with adrenal insufficiency.

## Section 2
A parent-designated adult may provide care for students with adrenal insufficiency, if needed. Requirements for parent-designated adult eligibility, limitations on supervision, and related provisions are provided in RCW 28A.210.260(1)(h).
