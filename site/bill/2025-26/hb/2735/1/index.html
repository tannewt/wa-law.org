<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Parents are responsible for protecting and preserving the health and well-being of their minor children. When two adults choose to have a child together, they incur enduring fiduciary-like duties of care and loyalty;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Troxel v. Granville, the United States supreme court recognized parental rights as a fundamental liberty interest, yet declined to set a standard of review;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the United States Constitution is the supreme law of the land, it behooves us to apply Madisonian guardrails around parental and children's rights;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first amendment protects freedom of speech, and it guarantees that citizens may speak without fear of government retaliation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fourteenth amendment guarantees due process, where no person shall be deprived of liberty without due process of law.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends for this chapter to be implemented subject to a constitutional floor that consists of the following principles:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Presumption of parental fitness. Similar to the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, a parent is presumed to be a fit parent unless the state proves otherwise. A fit parent is a sovereign actor, entrusted by nature and recognized by law to direct the child's development to adulthood. The parent holds a natural right to exercise authority over the child. The child holds a reciprocal natural right to be raised by fit sovereign parents. The custodial presumption is that parents will agree upon a 50/50 custody solution unless they agree upon another arrangement. Concrete proven violence, substance abuse, or neglect negates this presumption;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strict scrutiny and least restrictive means. Any intrusion on the parent-child bond must err on the side of the United States Constitution and be the least restrictive to those rights;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equal standing. Similarly situated parents must be treated equally;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parental duty to cooperate. Parents must cooperate in accordance with enforceable behaviors that prevent sabotage and keep both homes functional; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nondelegation and auditable orders. Advisors may advise but only judges decide. Court orders must be clear and contestable. No secret evidence or one-way pipelines may be permitted.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Together, these principles replace drift with equilibrium and discretion with auditable discipline. The constitutional floor overturns no precedent, respects federalism, and invites state innovation above the floor.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This act may be known and cited as Troxel II.</p>
