<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Workforce mobility is important to economic growth and development;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agreements limiting competition or hiring restrain trade and commerce and may be contracts of adhesion that may be unreasonable; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provisions in this chapter facilitating workforce mobility and protecting employees and independent contractors must be liberally construed and exceptions narrowly construed. In addition, nonsolicitation agreements, which prohibit an employee from actively soliciting current customers or employees away from the employer, are not prohibited; however, the definition of nonsolicitation agreement must be narrowly construed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</p>
