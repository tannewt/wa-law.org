<li>
<p>Entering into a contract with the service provider for $600 or more in a calendar year.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>$25 per month per service provider; or</p>

<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The division of child support may issue an income withholding order:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>As authorized by a support order that contains a notice clearly stating that child support may be collected by withholding from earnings, wages, or benefits without further notice to the obligated parent; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After service of a notice containing an income-withholding provision under this chapter or chapter 74.20A RCW.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The division of child support shall serve an income withholding order upon a responsible parent's employer or upon the employment security department for the state in possession of or owing any benefits from the unemployment compensation fund to the responsible parent pursuant to Title 50 RCW or from the paid family and medical leave program under Title 50A RCW:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>In the manner prescribed for the service of a summons in a civil action;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By certified mail, return receipt requested;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By electronic means if there is an agreement between the secretary and the person, firm, corporation, association, political subdivision, department of the state, or agency, subdivision, or instrumentality of the United States to accept service by electronic means; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By regular mail to a responsible parent's employer unless the division of child support reasonably believes that service of process in the manner prescribed in (a) or (b) of this subsection is required for initiating an action to ensure employer compliance with the withholding requirement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service of an income withholding order upon an employer or employment security department requires the employer or employment security department to immediately make a mandatory payroll deduction from the responsible parent's unpaid disposable earnings or benefits paid by the employment security department. The amount to be withheld stated in the income withholding order is as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If the income withholding order is not for a lump sum payment under RCW 26.23.063, the employer or employment security department shall thereafter deduct each pay period the amount stated in the order divided by the number of pay periods per month. The payroll deduction each pay period shall not exceed 50 percent of the responsible parent's disposable earnings; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the income withholding order is for a lump sum payment under RCW 26.23.063, the employer shall withhold the lump sum payment or the amount stated in the order, whichever is less, unless a portion of the lump sum payment is disposable earnings. If a portion of the lump sum payment is comprised of disposable earnings, 50 percent of the portion considered disposable earnings is not subject to the income withholding order.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An income withholding order for support shall have priority over any wage assignment, garnishment, attachment, or other legal process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The income withholding order shall be in writing and include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The name and social security number of the responsible parent;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amount to be deducted from the responsible parent's disposable earnings each month, or alternate amounts and frequencies as may be necessary to facilitate processing of the payroll deduction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A statement that the total amount withheld shall not exceed 50 percent of the responsible parent's disposable earnings;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The address to which the payments are to be mailed or delivered; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A notice to the responsible parent warning the responsible parent that, despite the payroll deduction, the responsible parent's privileges to obtain and maintain a license, as defined in RCW 74.20A.320, may not be renewed, or may be suspended if the parent is not in compliance with a support order as defined in RCW 74.20A.320.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An informational copy of the income withholding order shall be mailed to the last known address of the responsible parent by regular mail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An employer or employment security department that receives an income withholding order shall make immediate deductions from the responsible parent's unpaid disposable earnings and remit proper amounts to the Washington state support registry within seven working days of the date the earnings are payable to the responsible parent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An employer, or the employment security department, upon whom an income withholding order is served, shall make an answer to the division of child support within 20 days after the date of service. The answer shall confirm compliance and institution of the payroll deduction or explain the circumstances if no payroll deduction is in effect. The answer shall also state whether the responsible parent is employed by or receives earnings from the employer or receives benefit payments from the employment security department, whether the employer or employment security department anticipates paying earnings or benefits and the amount of earnings or benefit payments. If the responsible parent is no longer employed, or receiving earnings from the employer, the answer shall state the present employer's name and address, if known. If the responsible parent is no longer receiving benefit payments from the employment security department, the answer shall state the present employer's name and address, if known.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The returned answer or a payment remitted to the division of child support by the employer constitutes proof of service of the income withholding order in the case where the order was served by regular mail.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<p>The employer may deduct a processing fee from the remainder of the responsible parent's earnings after withholding under the income withholding order, even if the remainder is exempt under RCW 26.18.090. The processing fee may not exceed: (a) $10 for the first disbursement made to the Washington state support registry; and (b) one dollar for each subsequent disbursement to the registry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The income withholding order shall remain in effect until released by the division of child support, the court enters an order terminating the income withholding order and approving an alternate arrangement under RCW 26.23.050, or until 60 days after the employer no longer employs the responsible parent and is no longer in possession of or owing any earnings to the responsible parent. The employer shall promptly notify the office of support enforcement when the employer no longer employs the parent subject to the income withholding order. For the employment security department, the income withholding order shall remain in effect until released by the division of child support or until the court enters an order terminating the income withholding order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The division of child support must use income withholding forms adopted and required by the United States department of health and human services to take withholding actions under this section whether the responsible parent is receiving earnings or unemployment compensation in this state or in another state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this chapter and chapter 74.20A RCW, a service recipient must honor an income withholding order or order to withhold and deliver in the same manner as an employer. The actions of withholding and remitting pursuant to an income withholding order or order to withhold and deliver do not, by themselves, create an employer-employee relationship between a service provider and service recipient.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>By regular mail to an address if designated by the financial institution as a central levy or garnishment address, and if the notice is clearly identified as a levy or garnishment order.

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The division of child support must use income withholding forms adopted and required by the United States department of health and human services to take withholding actions under this section.</p>

<p>Where money is due and owing under any contract of employment, express or implied, or is held by any person, firm, corporation, or association, political subdivision, or department of the state, or agency, subdivision, or instrumentality of the United States subject to withdrawal by the debtor, such money shall be delivered by remittance payable to the order of the secretary.</p>

<p>A person, firm, corporation, or association, political subdivision, department of the state, or agency, subdivision, or instrumentality of the United States that complies with the order to withhold and deliver under this chapter is not civilly liable to the debtor for complying with the order to withhold and deliver under this chapter.</p>

The copy of the order shall be mailed or served together with a concise explanation of the right to petition for judicial review. This requirement is not jurisdictional, but, if the copy is not mailed or served as in this section provided, or if any irregularity appears with respect to the mailing or service, the superior court, in its discretion on motion of the debtor promptly made and supported by affidavit showing that the debtor has suffered substantial injury due to the failure to mail the copy, may set aside the order to withhold and deliver and award to the debtor an amount equal to the damages resulting from the secretary's failure to serve on or mail to the debtor the copy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An order to withhold and deliver issued in accordance with this section has priority over any other wage assignment, garnishment, attachment, or other legal process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The division of child support shall notify any person, firm, corporation, association, or political subdivision, department of the state, or agency, subdivision, or instrumentality of the United States required to withhold and deliver the earnings of a debtor under this action that they may deduct a processing fee from the remainder of the debtor's earnings, even if the remainder would otherwise be exempt under RCW 74.20A.090.
