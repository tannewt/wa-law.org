<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The licensee shall file an application for obtaining a new home state license based on a compact privilege, pay all applicable fees, and notify the current and new home state in accordance with the rules of the compact commission.</p>

<p>Take adverse action against a licensee's compact privilege within that member state; and</p>
</li>
<li>

Subpoenas issued by a licensing authority in a member state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another member state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before that court.

</li>
<li>
<p>The home state shall complete any pending investigations of a licensee who changes home states during the course of the investigations. The home state shall also have authority to take appropriate action(s) and shall promptly report the conclusions of the investigations to the administrator of the data system.

</li>
<li>
<p>A member state, if otherwise permitted by state law, may recover from the affected licensee the costs of investigations and dispositions of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that licensee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A member state may take adverse action based on the factual findings of another remote state, provided that the member state follows its own procedures for taking the adverse action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joint investigations:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>In addition to the authority granted to a member state by its respective state law, any member state may participate with other member states in joint investigations of licensees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Member states shall share any investigative, litigation, or compliance materials in furtherance of any joint investigation initiated under the compact.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If adverse action is taken by the home state against a licensee's home state license resulting in an encumbrance on the home state license, the licensee's compact privilege(s) in all other member states shall be revoked until all encumbrances have been removed from the home state license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a licensee shall include a statement that the licensee's compact privileges are revoked in all member states during the pendency of the order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once an encumbered license in the home state is restored to an unencumbered license (as certified by the home state's licensing authority), the licensee must meet the requirements of section 4(1) of this act and follow the administrative requirements to reapply to obtain a compact privilege in any remote state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a member state takes adverse action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the data system. The administrator of the data system shall promptly notify the other member states state of any adverse actions.</p>
