<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that it is important for all Washingtonians to thrive. The legislature finds that on many fronts men and boys struggle at a higher rate. Boys are struggling in school, with a lower average grade point average and a growing gap in graduation rates. Additionally, boys make up 94 percent of the population of juvenile rehabilitation. These issues are exacerbated for boys of color. As boys transition into adulthood, these problems continue to persist. Men make up 71 percent of the unsheltered population and 63 percent of people experiencing homelessness. Men also account for 79 percent of suicides. The legislature finds that addressing men's issues and improving the emotional well-being of men and increasing their sense of belonging will have a positive impact on larger societal issues such as loneliness, isolation, and gender-based violence.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that the development of public policy and the efficient delivery of governmental services to meet the needs of boys and men can be improved by establishing a focal point in state government focused on the well-being of men and boys. This includes but is not limited to increasing pathways to work and education, increasing physical and mental health support, and addressing the pervasive crisis of loneliness.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature deems it necessary to establish in statute the boys and men commission to further these purposes. The boys and men commission shall address issues relevant to the problems and needs of boys and men including improving physical and mental health outcomes, reducing stigma around mental health treatment, and expanding access to meaningful education, vocational, and mentorship opportunities. The boys and men commission shall address the challenges faced by all boys and men with an emphasis on boys and men of color, those in rural locations, those who identify as LGBTQ, and those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged and often find themselves left out of important conversations regarding their well-being and future.</p>
