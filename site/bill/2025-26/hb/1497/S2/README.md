# HB 1497 - Waste material management

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1497-S2.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that the state has established goals for the reduction of food waste and wasted food, and management of organic materials. The legislature also finds that it has enacted significant policies in recent years that are already showing promise in helping the state to achieve its food waste, wasted food, and organic materials management goals. More work, however, remains to be done in the organic materials management space, including the refinement of policies enacted in recent years to make the envisioned programs more efficient, implementable, comprehensive, and effective. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to take another step forward on the path toward more environmentally and economically sustainable food and organic materials management systems by enacting additional incremental policy changes to this end.

## Section 2
1. The department, through the center, must develop and administer grant programs to support the implementation of the requirements of this act, including the requirements of section 3 of this act, chapter 341, Laws of 2024, and chapter 180, Laws of 2022, with priority given to grants that support the implementation of RCW 70A.205.540 and 70A.205.545. Eligible recipients of grants under this section may include businesses that are subject to organic material management requirements, local governments, federally recognized Indian tribes and federally recognized Indian tribal government entities, nonprofit organizations, or organic material management facilities. Eligible expenses by grant recipients include education, outreach, technical assistance, indoor and outdoor infrastructure, transportation and processing infrastructure, and enforcement costs.

2. The department may not require, as a condition of financial assistance under this section, that matching funds be made available by a local government recipient. The department must provide assistance to each local government that demonstrates eligibility for grant assistance under this section.

3. An entity that is not in compliance with the requirements of section 3 of this act is not eligible to receive funding under this section.
