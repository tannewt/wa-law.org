<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the state has established goals for the reduction of food waste and wasted food, and management of organic materials. The legislature also finds that it has enacted significant policies in recent years that are already showing promise in helping the state to achieve its food waste, wasted food, and organic materials management goals. More work, however, remains to be done in the organic materials management space, including the refinement of policies enacted in recent years to make the envisioned programs more efficient, implementable, comprehensive, and effective. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to take another step forward on the path toward more environmentally and economically sustainable food and organic materials management systems by enacting additional incremental policy changes to this end.</p>

<li>
<p>The department must develop an education and outreach program focused on residential organics source separation participation and contamination reduction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The education and outreach program must include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>An assessment of barriers and motivators for the source separation of food scraps, which must include researching different terminologies, technologies, and strategies for representative audiences;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pilot strategies to motivate residents to increase the diversion of organic materials to productive uses while reducing contamination; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A toolkit for counties and cities to voluntarily implement that can be customized for different geographies and audiences. As part of the toolkit, the department must develop recommended performance metrics for use by counties and cities to measure residential organic materials diversion to productive uses, including the percentage of food waste that is appropriately source-separated and levels of contamination.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must hire an independent third party to:</p>
<ol type="a">

<li>
<p>Beginning April 1, 2030, each jurisdiction's source-separated organic solid waste collection service must include the acceptance of food waste year-round.

By January 1, 2027, the department must develop guidance under which local jurisdictions may exempt persons from this requirement if organic materials will be managed through an alternative mechanism that provides equal or better environmental outcomes. Nothing in this section precludes the ability of a person to use on-site composting, the diversion of organic materials to animal feed, self-haul organic materials to a facility, or other means of beneficially managing unwanted organic materials.
