<p>The department is tasked with generating greater local capacity. To achieve this objective, the department may advance funds to public benefit nonprofit corporations, as defined in RCW 24.03A.245, that have received grants from the department. This advance funding pilot program will provide advance funds, as described in this section, to eligible grant recipients who have demonstrated the need for advance funding in order to perform the work required by the department grant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall develop uniform equity-driven procedures for the demonstration of need. The department shall consult with external partners, including impacted communities, to develop the procedures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall develop eligibility criteria for advance fund applicants. The department shall prioritize those applicants with an average annual budget less than $5,000,000. The eligibility criteria must include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The recipient must have been awarded a department grant within six months;</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
