<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington state, being one of the first two states in the nation to legalize cannabis for adult use, has a mature cannabis industry that has earned its position as a national leader in industry efficiencies, product and brand development, and longevity of active operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that Washington's licensed cannabis industry's tax revenues now provide over two percent of the state's operating budget.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also recognizes that when the United States federal government deschedules or reschedules cannabis, interstate commerce for cannabis sales will become inevitable under federal law and Washington's licensed cannabis industry will be forced to compete in national markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that social equity applicants seeking licensure under the cannabis social equity program have discovered that it is desperately difficult or even impossible to find funding to open licensed cannabis operations. Restrictions against out-of-state investors have effectively blocked these applicants from attracting sufficient investors and have been highlighted as major barriers to the success of the program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that Washington's licensed cannabis industry has been restricted by a state residency requirement for licensees, blocking access to investors from other states, thus putting Washington cannabis licensees at a disadvantage compared to licensees in other states, almost none of which have such barriers to investment capital from other states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that people from many low-income and minority areas do not have the same access to investment capital to start businesses, thus denying certain demographics from achieving generational wealth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature acknowledges that residency requirements for licensing do not exist in any other industry and is in direct conflict with the dormant commerce clause of the United States Constitution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that it is urgent and critical to eliminate the state's residency requirement while also providing tax incentives to investors to attract investments for social equity applicants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that granting a time-limited tax exemption from the business and occupation tax for cannabis producers, processors, and retailers licensed through the cannabis social equity program, while these licensees start their businesses in the established market, will reduce the unique barriers these businesses are facing relative to other businesses outside and within the licensed cannabis industry. Additionally, also granting a time-limited tax exemption from the business and occupation tax for cannabis producers, processors, and retailers who obtain their license by transfer or assumption of a licensee in the cannabis social equity program, or from a licensee who was transferred or assumed a license from such a licensee, when the new owner or group of owners also meets the social equity applicant criteria, will similarly reduce the unique barriers these businesses will face relative to other businesses outside and within the licensed cannabis industry and will support the goals of the cannabis social equity program.</p>

<li>
<p>The board may cause an inspection of the premises to be made, and may inquire into all matters in connection with the construction and operation of the premises.

The board may submit the criminal history record information check to the Washington state patrol and to the identification division of the federal bureau of investigation in order that these agencies may search their records for prior arrests and convictions of the individual or individuals who filled out the forms. The board must require fingerprinting of any applicant whose criminal history record information check is submitted to the federal bureau of investigation. The provisions of RCW 9.95.240 and of chapter 9.96A RCW do not apply to these cases. Subject to the provisions of this section, the board may, in its discretion, grant or deny the renewal or license applied for. Denial may be based on, without limitation, the existence of chronic illegal activity documented in objections submitted pursuant to subsections (7)(c) and (10) of this section. Authority to approve an uncontested or unopposed license may be granted by the board to any staff member the board designates in writing. Conditions for granting this authority must be adopted by rule.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>A city, county, or town may permit the licensing of premises within 1,000 feet but not less than 100 feet of the facilities described in (a) of this subsection, except elementary schools, secondary schools, and playgrounds, by enacting an ordinance authorizing such distance reduction, provided that such distance reduction will not negatively impact the jurisdiction's civil regulatory enforcement, criminal law enforcement interests, public safety, or public health.</p>

<p>In determining whether to grant or deny a license or renewal of any license, the board must give substantial weight to objections from an incorporated city or town or county legislative authority based upon chronic illegal activity associated with the applicant's operations of the premises proposed to be licensed or the applicant's operation of any other licensed premises, or the conduct of the applicant's patrons inside or outside the licensed premises. &quot;Chronic illegal activity&quot; means (a) a pervasive pattern of activity that threatens the public health, safety, and welfare of the city, town, or county including, but not limited to, open container violations, assaults, disturbances, disorderly conduct, or other criminal law violations, or as documented in crime statistics, police reports, emergency medical response data, calls for service, field data, or similar records of a law enforcement agency for the city, town, county, or any other municipal corporation or any state agency; or (b) an unreasonably high number of citations for violations of RCW 46.61.502 associated with the applicant's or licensee's operation of any licensed premises as indicated by the reported statements given to law enforcement upon arrest.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The objection to the issuance of a cannabis retail license at the specified location is based on a preexisting local ordinance limiting outlet density in a specific geographic area. For purposes of this subsection (11), a preexisting local ordinance is an ordinance enacted and in effect before the date the applicant submits an application for a cannabis retail license to the board identifying the premises proposed to be licensed. No objection related to the physical location of a proposed premises may be made by a local government under this subsection (11) based on a local ordinance enacted after the date the applicant submits an application for a cannabis retail license to the board identifying the premises proposed to be licensed.</p>

<p>It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to provide these tax preferences to a designated class of taxpayers who are cannabis producers, processors, and retailers licensed under the cannabis social equity program in RCW 69.50.335, or who are cannabis producers, processors, or retailers who obtain a license by transfer or assumption from a licensee in the cannabis social equity program or from a licensee who previously obtained a license by transfer or assumption from such a licensee, and who also meet the social equity applicant criteria.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that this designated class of taxpayers faces unique barriers in their business relative to other producers, manufacturers, processors, and retailers in general, as well as relative to cannabis producers, cannabis processors, and cannabis retailers licensed outside of the cannabis social equity program, the majority of which have years of operating experience and growth after selecting prime locations within a market with a limited number of licenses and locations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that eligibility for licensure through the cannabis social equity program is connected to documented evidence of disproportionate impacts of historical enforcement of criminal laws related to cannabis or other social disadvantages, and serves to remedy past discrimination against, or disproportionate impacts on, persons who are members of legally protected classes under state and federal antidiscrimination laws, and prevent future discrimination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that providing time-limited business and occupation tax exemptions for licensees in the cannabis social equity program, and certain licensees who obtain a license by transfer or assumption from licensees in the cannabis social equity program, or from licensees who were transferred or assumed such licenses, and who also meet the social equity applicant criteria, will reduce the historical barriers and tax and financial burdens facing these businesses as they enter the lucrative market and start to build generational wealth through growing a sustainable business.</p>
