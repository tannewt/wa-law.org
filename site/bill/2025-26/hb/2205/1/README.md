[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2205.pdf)

## Section 1
The state has long prohibited all forms and means of gambling except where carefully and specifically authorized and regulated. The legislature intends to bolster the regulated sports wagering industry. Currently, sports wagering in Washington is offered exclusively by tribal casinos subject to gaming compacts entered pursuant to the Indian gaming regulatory act. This offering has proven to meet the state's policy of offering gambling only in a highly regulated environment that is safe for the public.
