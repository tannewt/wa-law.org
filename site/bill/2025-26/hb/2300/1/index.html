<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Recent federal changes to the medicaid program will affect all sectors of Washington's health care system. With reduced federal moneys, there will be pressure for the state to restore funds to maintain critical health services and program eligibility. By seeking reimbursement from employers whose workers are enrolled in medical assistance programs, the state can preserve the coverage and services available to Washingtonians who rely on publicly financed health care; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An important part of a comprehensive approach to providing appropriate health care for all Washington citizens involves participation by employers in providing access to health care services for their workers and their families. While most Washington citizens obtain health care services through their employment or the employment of a family member, some employers with adequate resources fail to offer affordable access to health care services to their workers in Washington state. This creates inappropriate competitive advantages for those employers and greatly increases the likelihood that their workers will not have access to affordable health care services or will receive health care services through publicly funded health care programs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to establish, as part of its comprehensive approach to preserving access to appropriate health care services, a mechanism to reimburse the state for its costs of providing access to appropriate health care services to Washington workers. Employer participation in this comprehensive approach allows the state to improve its financing of public health care programs and prioritize those resources on populations not served through employment. It also reduces the burden on taxpayers and the public health care system, and protects the health, safety, and well-being of all the state's residents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In establishing this program, it is not the intent of the legislature to influence the establishment, content, or administration of employee benefit plans. The legislature is neutral regarding whether employers choose to provide access to affordable health care coverage for their workers or pay an assessment to reimburse the state's costs for health care services for their workers.</p>
