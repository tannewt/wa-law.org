# HB 2323 - Traffic stops/blue envelope

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2323.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that traffic stops can be tense situations for the driver and law enforcement officer, and that people who are neurodivergent may react in a manner that could be misunderstood in the context of a traffic stop, inadvertently resulting in an escalation of the situation. The legislature, therefore, intends to establish a voluntary blue envelope program to enhance communication between law enforcement and community members with a disability or condition that may be helpful during traffic stops.

## Section 2
1. The department, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, shall develop a blue envelope program for operators and passengers of motor vehicles with a disability or condition that could impact the way they interact with law enforcement during a traffic stop. The blue envelope developed as part of the program must contain the following:

    a. Printed information for the envelope's holder regarding traffic stop safety tips;

    b. Printed recommendations for the responding law enforcement officer with interaction techniques applicable to those who are neurodivergent to help promote enhanced communication and accommodation between law enforcement officers and community members; and

    c. Printed information on the envelope explaining that documents related to the qualified individual's vehicle including, but not limited to, vehicle registration documents and proof of insurance, should be enclosed within the envelope.

2. The blue envelope program must allow a qualified individual to obtain, at no cost, a blue envelope from any driver licensing office within the state.

3. The department must maintain on an existing website clear, accessible program information and resources regarding the blue envelope program.
