<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The department of health is the designated state radiation control agency and has the authority to establish regulations relating to control of sources of ionizing radiation. Using that authority, in December 2024, the department of health issued rules that, among other changes, limited the screening capabilities of correctional facilities. This included requiring body scanners to operate at one-eighth of their previous imaging power, resulting in unclear images that diminish the ability of correctional staff to identify concealed narcotics potentially leading to dangerous health and safety impacts, including overdose;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Effective screening is essential to protecting the health and safety of all incarcerated individuals, facility staff, and the public visiting in correctional facilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This reduction in imaging capability has already contributed to serious health and safety incidents and nearly an overdose death. These incidents underscore the urgent need to restore screening effectiveness to prevent further harm to individuals' health and safety;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dose levels restored by this act remain well below widely accepted public and occupational health limits for ionizing radiation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Correctional facilities must have access to screening technologies capable of detecting hidden narcotics and other contraband that endanger lives. Overdose incidents within jails have increased statewide, and reduced scanning effectiveness poses a growing risk to both incarcerated individuals and correctional staff.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to require the department of health to revise radiation dose thresholds for contraband screening in correctional facilities to restore the operational effectiveness of body scanners while maintaining safe exposure limits. This change will balance health protections for incarcerated individuals with the urgent need to prevent lethal drugs and other dangerous contraband from entering secure facilities, thereby safeguarding the lives of those who live and work within them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The department of health as the designated state radiation control agency may not establish effective dosage limits or other restrictions intended to reduce the effective radiation dose through rule making or other means for ionizing radiation screening systems used in correctional facilities, detention facilities, or jails that conflict with this section. The department of health may not establish a limit on the:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Total effective radiation dose delivered by an ionizing radiation screening system per screening that is less than 2 µSv (0.2 mrem);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Total effective dose per calendar year for an individual who has been committed to a correctional facility or who has been presented for confinement in a jail or detention facility that is less than 0.25 mSV (25 mrem); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Level of radiation in the area outside the radiation screening zone in any one hour that is less than 20 µSv (2 mrem). When installed and operated according to manufacturer specifications, an ionizing radiation screening system meeting the standards in this section is deemed compliant with the radiation limits for the area outside the radiation screening zone.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An ionizing radiation screening system must be permitted to operate at an effective dose of at least 2 μSv (0.2 mrem) per screening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Correctional facility&quot; has the same meaning as &quot;correctional institution&quot; in RCW 9.94.049;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Detention facility&quot; means a county facility, paid for by the county, for the physical confinement of a juvenile alleged to have committed an offense or an adjudicated offender subject to a disposition or modification order. &quot;Detention facility&quot; includes county group homes, inpatient substance abuse programs, juvenile basic training camps, and electronic monitoring;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Ionizing radiation screening system&quot; means a system that intentionally exposes an individual to ionizing radiation for imaging purposes in a correctional facility, detention facility, or jail and is regulated by the department of health;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Jail&quot; means any holding, detention, special detention, or correctional facility as defined in RCW 70.48.020; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Radiation screening zone&quot; means the general area established for the purpose of limiting or controlling access to the area where screening will be performed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
