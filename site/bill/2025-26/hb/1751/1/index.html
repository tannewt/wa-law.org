<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the rising costs of textbooks and other required course materials pose a significant financial burden on students pursuing higher education. To promote educational accessibility and reduce expenses for students, it is the intent of the legislature to exempt required course materials from retail sales and use taxes.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that precedence has been set for this policy as 36 states and Puerto Rico have some form of sales tax exemption for course materials either through a direct exemption, no sales taxes, or through not taxing digital goods.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that nationwide, the price of textbooks increases on average six percent each year, doubling every 11 years, and has increased 1,041 percent between 1977 and 2015. The legislature finds that these increases have direct impacts on student success as 65 percent of college students report not buying a textbook because of cost and 11 percent report skipping meals in order to afford course materials.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that students who qualify for Washington's state financial aid programs can use funds to purchase textbooks, required course materials, and other necessary materials for their academic success. The legislature finds that nationwide 5,200,000 undergraduate students spend an average of $1,500,000,000 of financial aid on textbooks each semester. The high costs of these items require the use of a student's state financial aid to pay for these items over housing, basic needs, transportation, and other academic necessities.</p>
