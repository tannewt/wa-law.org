# HB 2554 - Tribal fishing rights

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2554.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that chapter 77.110 RCW is inconsistent with judicially affirmed and treaty-reserved fishing rights. The legislature also finds that chapter 77.110 RCW conflicts with well-established state-tribal cooperative fishery management agreements. Therefore, the legislature acknowledges that in order to keep its commitments and relationship with Pacific Northwest tribes and to avoid any legal confusion with current cooperative agreements, it is necessary to repeal chapter 77.110 RCW.
