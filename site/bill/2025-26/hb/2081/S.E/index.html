<p>Upon every person engaging within this state in the business of cleaning up for the United States, or its instrumentalities, radioactive waste and other by-products of weapons production and nuclear research and development; as to such persons the amount of the tax with respect to such business shall be equal to the gross income of the business multiplied by the rate of 0.5 percent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this chapter, &quot;cleaning up radioactive waste and other by-products of weapons production and nuclear research and development&quot; means:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The activities of handling, storing, treating, immobilizing, stabilizing, or disposing of radioactive waste, radioactive tank waste and capsules, nonradioactive hazardous solid and liquid wastes, or spent nuclear fuel;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spent nuclear fuel conditioning;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removal of contamination in soils and groundwater;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decontamination and decommissioning of facilities; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Services supporting the performance of cleanup. For the purposes of this subsection (2)(e), a service supports the performance of cleanup if it:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Is within the scope of work under a clean-up contract with the United States department of energy; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assists in the accomplishment of a requirement of a clean-up project undertaken by the United States department of energy under a subcontract entered into with the prime contractor or another subcontractor in furtherance of a clean-up contract between the United States department of energy and a prime contractor.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A service does not assist in the accomplishment of a requirement of a clean-up project undertaken by the United States department of energy if the same services are routinely provided to businesses not engaged in clean-up activities, except that the following services are always deemed to contribute to the accomplishment of a requirement of a clean-up project undertaken by the United States department of energy:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Information technology and computer support services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Services rendered in respect to infrastructure; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security, safety, and health services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends that the examples provided in this subsection be used as a guideline when determining whether a service is &quot;routinely provided to businesses not engaged in clean-up activities&quot; as that phrase is used in subsection (3) of this section.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The radioactive waste clean-up classification does not apply to general accounting services but does apply to performance audits performed for persons cleaning up radioactive waste.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The radioactive waste clean-up classification does not apply to general legal services but does apply to those legal services that assist in the accomplishment of a requirement of a clean-up project undertaken by the United States department of energy. Thus, legal services provided to contest any local, state, or federal tax liability or to defend a company against a workers' compensation claim arising from a worksite injury do not qualify for the radioactive waste clean-up classification. But, legal services related to the resolution of a contractual dispute between the parties to a clean-up contract between the United States department of energy and a prime contractor do qualify.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>General office janitorial services do not qualify for the radioactive waste clean-up classification, but the specialized cleaning of equipment exposed to radioactive waste does qualify.</p>

    i. To aid in the effective administration of this subsection (2), the department may require a person claiming to be subject to the 1.75 percent tax rate under (a)(i) of this subsection (2) or the 1.5 percent tax rate under (a)(ii)(B) of this subsection (2) to identify all of the person's affiliates, including their department tax registration number or unified business identifier number, as may be applicable, or to certify that the person is not affiliated with any other person. Requests under this subsection (2)(d)(i) must be in writing and may be made electronically.

    ii. If the department establishes, by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence, that a person, with intent to evade the additional taxes due under either the 1.75 percent tax rate in (a)(i) of this subsection (2) or the 2.1 percent tax rate in (a)(iii) of this subsection (2), failed to provide the department with complete and accurate information in response to a written request under (d)(i) of this subsection (2) within 30 days of such request, the person is ineligible for the lesser applicable tax rate in this subsection (2) for the entire current calendar year and the following four calendar years. However, the department must waive the provisions of this subsection (2)(d)(ii) for any tax reporting period that the person is otherwise eligible for the 1.75 percent tax rate in (a)(i) of this subsection (2) or the 1.5 percent tax rate in (a)(ii) of this subsection (2) if (A) the department has not previously determined that the person failed to fully comply with (d)(i) of this subsection (2), and (B) within 30 days of the notice of additional tax due as a result of the person's failure to fully comply with (d)(i) of this subsection (2) the department determines that the person has come into full compliance with (d)(i) of this subsection (2). This subsection (2)(d) applies only with respect to persons claiming entitlement to the 1.5 percent tax rate solely by reason of (a)(ii)(B) of this subsection (2).

e. For the purposes of (a)(i) or (ii)(B) of this subsection (2), if a taxpayer is subject to the reconciliation provisions of RCW 82.04.462(4), and calculates gross income of the business subject to the tax imposed under this subsection (2) for the immediately preceding calendar year, or aggregate gross income of the business subject to the tax imposed under this subsection (2) for the immediately preceding calendar year for all affiliated persons, based on incomplete information, the taxpayer must correct the reporting for the current calendar year when complete information for the immediately preceding calendar year is available.

f. For purposes of this subsection (2), the definitions in this subsection (2)(f) apply:

<p>(I) It is the type of lease permitted to be made by national banks (see 12 U.S.C. Sec. 24(7) and (10), comptroller of the currency regulations, part 23, leasing (added by 56 C.F.R. Sec. 28314, June 20, 1991, effective July 22, 1991), and regulation Y of the federal reserve system 12 C.F.R. Part 225.25, as amended); and</p>
<p>(II) It is the economic equivalent of an extension of credit, i.e., the lease is treated by the lessor as a loan for federal income tax purposes. In no event does a lease qualify as an extension of credit where the lessor takes depreciation on such property for federal income tax purposes.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that the decision of the state supreme court in Antio, LLC v. Department of Revenue could lead to uncertainty insofar as it affirms that the business and occupation tax deduction provided in RCW 82.04.4281 for the investment income of persons is only applicable if such income is from investments that are incidental to the main purpose of a person's business, without providing a bright line rule for what constitutes incidental to the main purpose of the person's business. The legislature intends, by adopting this revision of the statute, to avoid uncertainty and provide clarity around what incidental to the main purpose of the business means and, by extension, what income qualifies for the business and occupation tax deduction provided in RCW 82.04.4281 for investment income.</p>
<p>The legislature also intends to make it clear that amounts received by individuals from personal investments are generally not considered amounts received from engaging in business and therefore are not subject to the business and occupation tax. To that end, the legislature directs the department of revenue to provide guidance on what constitutes income from personal investments that are not considered engaging in business and thus not subject to the business and occupation tax.</p>
<p>The legislature further intends to make it clear that nondeductible investment income is subject to the service and other activities business and occupation tax classification and should be apportioned in accordance with RCW 82.04.462.</p>
