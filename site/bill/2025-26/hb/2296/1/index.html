<li>
<p>An electric utility may recover the cost of service work on any customer-owned meter-mounted device, or maintenance or repair work on any electric utility-owned equipment necessary due to the installation of a customer-owned meter-mounted device, by charging the customer directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each electric utility must implement the provisions of this section no later than six months after the effective date of this section.</p>
