<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature intends to extend and evaluate the cannabis social equity program, and conduct a review and analysis of the first round of licensing and grant awards that was recently conducted before 2025, to support the successful implementation of the cannabis social equity program. By requiring the liquor and cannabis board, in consultation with the department of commerce when appropriate, to evaluate the cannabis social equity program as provided in this act and submit a report with findings and policy options to the governor and legislature by December 1, 2025, the legislature will have an opportunity in the 2026 legislative session to make any policy changes the legislature deems appropriate, before a second and subsequent rounds of licensing opening in the cannabis social equity program. The legislature also intends to extend the cannabis social equity program an additional two years until July 1, 2034. The evaluation required by this act must include opportunities for public feedback, and the identification of any provisions of law or rule and any economic, market, or practical factors that effectively prevent or hinder the successful opening, operation, and business success of cannabis businesses licensed under the cannabis social equity program. This will provide the legislature with information to ensure policies are in place to support successful and efficient implementation of the program.</p>
