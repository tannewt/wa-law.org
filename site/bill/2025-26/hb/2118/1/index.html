<p>An association may not enter into, amend, or enforce a covenant, condition, or restriction in such a way that imposes more onerous restrictions on the types of use of a unit than those restrictions that existed when the unit owner acquired the unit owner's interest in the unit, unless the unit owner who owns the affected unit expressly agrees in writing at the time of the adoption or amendment of the covenant, condition, or restriction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a unit owner claims the benefit of this subsection (1), the unit owner must request that the association record, or allow recording of, the exception applicable to the unit owner. Upon request by the unit owner, the association, the unit owner, or a designee must record the unit owner's exception in every county in which the affected unit is situated. The unit owner must provide the association with the date on which the affected unit was conveyed to the unit owner and must pay the recording fees for the document setting forth the exception.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A unit owner's successor-in-interest may not claim the benefit of subsection (1) of this section to the extent that the association entered into, amended, or enforced a covenant, condition, or restriction before the successor-in-interest purchased the unit, even if the covenant, condition, or restriction was not enforceable against the previous unit owner pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, unless the successor-in-interest is owned by or shares ownership with the previous unit owner or unless the successor-in-interest is a lender that acquired the unit through foreclosure.</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section may be construed to prevent the enforcement of a covenant, condition, or restriction limiting the types of use of a unit as long as the covenant, condition, or restriction applied to the unit at the time the unit owner acquired an interest in the unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section invalidates covenants, conditions, or restrictions that existed before the effective date of this section or creates a private right of action for actions or omissions occurring before the effective date of this section. However, on or after the effective date of this section, unless the unit owner has consented as provided by subsection (1) of this section, an association may not enforce a covenant, condition, or restriction in such a way that limits the types of use that were allowed for a unit when the unit owner acquired the affected unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;types of use&quot; means the following lawful types of use of the unit:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Use for residential, agricultural, or commercial purposes, unless the use was impermissible according to the written or recorded restrictions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to rent the unit, including the unit's land and structures, for any amount of time; and</p>
