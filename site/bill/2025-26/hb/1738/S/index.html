<p>The legislature finds that service to our nation is a selfless sacrifice carried out by members of the armed forces, uniformed services, and their families.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature finds that members of the uniformed services should be afforded the same benefits and opportunities when choosing to continue public service employment in Washington state.</p>
<p>The legislature further recognizes the need to support employment opportunities for veterans, who served at any time in our nation's history and obtained a qualifying discharge, and spouses who support our current active duty force by allowing for hiring preference.</p>
