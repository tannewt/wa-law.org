        ii. The objecting provider commits to complete construction of broadband infrastructure and provide broadband service to end users in the proposed project area at speeds equal to or greater than the speeds contained in the definition of broadband in RCW 43.330.530(4), no later than 24 months after the date awards are made under this section for the grant and loan cycle under which the preapplication was submitted.

    b. Objections submitted to the board under this subsection must be certified by affidavit.

    c. The board may evaluate the information submitted under this section by the objecting provider and must consider it in making a determination on the proposed broadband project objected to.

The board may choose to not fund a proposed broadband project if the board determines that the objecting provider's commitment to provide broadband service that meets the requirements of (a) of this subsection in the proposed project area is credible. In assessing the commitment, the board may consider whether the objecting provider has or will provide a bond, letter of credit, or other indicia of financial commitment guaranteeing the project's completion.

    d. If the board denies funding to an applicant for a proposed broadband project as a result of a broadband service provider's objection made under this section, and the broadband service provider does not fulfill its commitment to provide broadband service in the project area, then for the following two grant and loan cycles, the board is prohibited from denying funding to an applicant for a proposed broadband project on the basis of a challenge by the same broadband service provider, unless the board determines that the broadband service provider's failure to fulfill the provider's commitment was the result of factors beyond the broadband service provider's control. The board is not prohibited from denying funding to an applicant for a proposed broadband project for reasons other than an objection by the same broadband service provider.

    e. An applicant or broadband service provider that objected to the application for a proposed broadband project may request a debriefing conference regarding the board's decision on the application. Requests for debriefing must be coordinated by the office and must be submitted in writing in accordance with procedures specified by the office.
