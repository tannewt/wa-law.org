<p>If the board denies funding to an applicant for a proposed broadband project as a result of a broadband service provider's objection made under this section, and the broadband service provider does not fulfill its commitment to provide broadband service in the project area, then for the following two grant and loan cycles, the board is prohibited from denying funding to an applicant for a proposed broadband project on the basis of a challenge by the same broadband service provider, unless the board determines that the broadband service provider's failure to fulfill the provider's commitment was the result of factors beyond the broadband service provider's control. The board is not prohibited from denying funding to an applicant for a proposed broadband project for reasons other than an objection by the same broadband service provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An applicant or broadband service provider that objected to the application for a proposed broadband project may request a debriefing conference regarding the board's decision on the application.
