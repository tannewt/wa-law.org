<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that community-based health care providers are preferred for providing transitional care services to incarcerated individuals preparing for release due to their provision of comprehensive, integrated primary care services, focus on addressing social determinants of health, and continuity of care after release from incarceration.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that unlike large third-party health care providers, community-based health care providers are generally too small to self-insure and are prevented from providing health care in carceral settings due to the reluctance of private insurers to provide medical malpractice insurance in carceral settings and because federal government insurance coverage does not extend to state carceral settings.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that the inability of community-based health care providers to provide transitional care services in carceral settings creates obstacles for local governments contracting for health care services by limiting options and driving up costs.</p>
<p>The legislature is committed to facilitating the provision of high quality, low-cost health care to, and enabling safe transitions of care for, incarcerated individuals preparing for release back into communities.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that providing a medical malpractice claim reimbursement program will enable community-based providers to provide health care services in carceral settings and increase local governments' contracting options.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that engagement of community-based health care providers in carceral settings improves outcomes upon release, including reduced recidivism rates, greater trust of health care systems, and increased compliance with treatment plans.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
