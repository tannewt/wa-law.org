<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Consumer access to affordable and reliable products that contain digital electronics, including computers, cell phones, appliances, and other nonexempted consumer products, is essential to overcome digital inequities in Washington state and that broader distribution of the information, parts, and tools necessary to repair digital electronic products will shorten repair times, lengthen the useful lives of digital electronic products, and lower costs for consumers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consumers increasingly rely on these products to conduct personal and professional business daily. Many modern consumer products contain digital components, such as microprocessors and microchips, which can create barriers to repairs. In some United States' households, everything from the coffee maker, to the washing machine, vacuum, thermostat, or doorbell may have a digital component as technology has evolved and smart products have increased in popularity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The need for more accessible and affordable repair options is felt more acutely among specific sectors of the population, notably Washington residents in rural areas and people who earn low incomes. Original manufacturer shops or authorized repair providers are often located in urban areas requiring consumers to travel long distances for repair or be without products for periods of time;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small, independent businesses play a vital role in Washington's economy. Providing access to information, parts, and tools is essential in contributing to a competitive repair market, allowing small repair shop employees to repair products more safely;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certain electronic products are comprised of precious metals that are finite, and unnecessary early disposal can be avoided with greater accessibility to proper and affordable repair; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other states such as Minnesota, New York, California, and Colorado have enacted right to repair legislation, recognizing the need to increase access to the documentation, tools, and parts necessary to facilitate multiple repair options for all kinds of consumer products with digital electronics.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to broaden access to the information and tools necessary to repair digital electronic products, including computers, cell phones, appliances, and other nonexempted products in a safe, secure, reliable, and sustainable manner, thereby increasing access to appropriate and affordable digital electronic products, supporting small businesses and jobs, and making it easier for all residents of Washington state to connect digitally.</p>
