6. A controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the controller's refusal to take action on a request within a reasonable period of time after the consumer's receipt of the decision. The appeal process must be conspicuously available and similar to the process for submitting consumer rights requests. Within 45 days of receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions.

A controller shall establish, and describe in the controller's privacy notice, one or more secure and reliable means for consumers to submit a request to exercise their consumer rights pursuant to this chapter. Such means must take into account the ways in which consumers normally interact with the controller, the need for secure and reliable communication of such requests, and the ability of the controller to verify the identity of the consumer making the request. Such means must include:

    a. Providing a clear and conspicuous link on the controller's internet website to an internet web page that enables a consumer, or an agent of the consumer, to opt out of the targeted advertising, the sale of the consumer's personal data, and profiling in furtherance of solely automated decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning the consumer; and

    b. Not later than December 31, 2025, allowing a consumer to opt out of any collection or processing of the consumer's personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, or any sale of the consumer's personal data, through an opt-out preference signal that is sent, with the consumer's consent, by a platform, technology, or mechanism to the controller and that indicates the consumer's intent to opt out of any processing or sale. The platform, technology, or mechanism must:

        i. Be consumer friendly and easy to use by the average consumer; and

        ii. Enable the controller to reasonably determine that the consumer is a Washington resident or a resident of a different state whose data is collected in Washington state, and whether the consumer has made a legitimate request to opt out of any sale of such consumer's personal data or targeted advertising. For purposes of this subsection, the use of an internet protocol address to estimate the consumer's location shall be considered sufficient to reasonably determine residency.

10. If a consumer's decision to opt out of any processing of the consumer's personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, or any sale of the consumer's personal data, through an opt-out preference signal sent in accordance with subsection (9) of this section conflicts with the consumer's existing controller specific privacy setting or voluntary participation in a controller's financial incentive program, the controller shall comply with the consumer's opt-out preference signal, but may notify the consumer of the conflict and provide to the consumer the choice to confirm the controller specific privacy setting or participation in the program.

11. If a controller responds to the consumer opt-out requests received pursuant to subsection (9) of this section by informing the consumer of a change in the price, rate, level, quality, or selection of goods or services, the controller shall present the terms of any financial incentive offered pursuant to section 6(7) of this act for the retention, use, sale, or sharing of the consumer's personal data.

## Section 6
1. [Empty]

    a. Except as specified in (b) of this subsection, a controller shall limit the collection, processing, and transfer of personal data to what is strictly necessary in relation to provide or maintain:

        i. A specific product or service requested by the consumer to whom the data pertains, including any routine administrative, operational, or account-servicing activity, such as billing, shipping, delivery, storage, or accounting; or

        ii. A communication, that is not an advertisement, by the controller to the consumer reasonably anticipated within the context of the relationship between the controller and the consumer.

    b. A controller may only collect and transfer consumer health data in accordance with RCW 19.373.030.

    c. Except with respect to sensitive data, a controller may process or transfer personal data collected under this subsection to provide first-party advertising or targeted advertising. However, this subsection does not permit the processing or transfer of personal data for targeted advertising to a consumer who has opted out of such advertising pursuant to this chapter or to a consumer under circumstances where the controller has knowledge, or willfully disregards, that the consumer is a minor.

2. Except as specified in RCW 19.373.030, a controller may not transfer sensitive data concerning a consumer without obtaining the consumer's affirmative consent, or, in the case of the collection or processing of sensitive data of a known child, without collecting or processing such data in accordance with the children's online privacy protection act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 6501 through 6506 and its implementing regulations.

3. A controller may not sell sensitive data, with the exception of consumer health data, which may be sold in accordance with RCW 19.373.070.

4. A controller shall establish, implement, and maintain administrative, technical, and physical data security practices that, at a minimum, satisfy reasonable standard of care within the controller's industry to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of personal data appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal data at issue, including disposing of personal data in accordance with a retention schedule that requires the deletion of personal data when the data is required to be deleted by law or is no longer necessary for the purpose for which the data was collected, processed, or transferred.

5. A controller shall provide an effective mechanism for a consumer to revoke the consumer's affirmative consent that is at least as easy as the mechanism by which the consumer provided the consumer's affirmative consent. Upon revocation of the consumer's affirmative consent, the controller shall cease to process the data as soon as practicable, but not later than 15 days after the receipt of the revocation.

6. A controller may not process the personal data of a consumer for purposes of targeted advertising or sell the consumer's personal data under the circumstances where a controller has actual knowledge, or willfully disregards, that the consumer is a minor.

7. [Empty]

    a. A controller may not discriminate or retaliate against a consumer for exercising any of the consumer rights contained in this chapter, or for refusing to agree to the collection or processing of personal data for a separate product or service, including by denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or services, or providing a different level of quality of goods or services to the consumer.

    b. Nothing in this subsection may be construed to require a controller to provide a product or service that requires the personal data of a consumer which the controller does not collect or maintain.

    c. [Empty]

        i. Nothing in this subsection may be construed to prohibit a controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no fee, if the offering is in connection with a consumer's voluntary participation in a financial incentive program, such as a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts, or club card program, provided that the controller may not transfer personal data to a third party as part of such a program unless:

(A) The transfer is functionally necessary to enable the third party to provide a benefit to which the consumer is entitled;

(B) The transfer of personal data to the third party is clearly disclosed in the terms of the program; and

(C) The third party uses the personal data only for purposes of facilitating a benefit to which the consumer is entitled and does not process or transfer the personal data for any other purpose.

        ii. The sale of personal data must not be considered functionally necessary to provide a financial incentive program. A controller may not use financial incentive practices that are unjust, unreasonable, coercive, or usurious in nature.

8. [Empty]

    a. A controller or processor may not collect, process, or transfer personal data in a manner that discriminates against an individual or class of individuals, or otherwise makes unavailable the equal enjoyment of goods or services, on the basis of an individual's or class of individuals' actual or perceived race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, religion, ancestry, or national origin.

    b. This subsection does not apply to:

        i. The collection, processing, or transfer of personal data for the sole purpose of a controller's or processor's self-testing to prevent or mitigate unlawful discrimination or otherwise to ensure compliance with state or federal law, or for the sole purpose of diversifying an applicant, participant, or customer pool; or

        ii. A private establishment, as described in 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000a(e).

9. [Empty]

    a. A controller must provide consumers with a reasonably accessible, clear, and meaningful privacy notice that includes:

        i. The categories of personal data collected and processed by the controller, including a separate list of categories of sensitive data collected and processed by the controller, described in a level of detail that provides consumers a meaningful understanding of the type of personal data collected or processed;

        ii. The categories of sources from which the consumer health data is collected;

        iii. The purpose for collecting and processing each category of personal data the controller collects or processes, described in a way that gives consumers a meaningful understanding of how each category of the consumers' personal data will be used;

        iv. How consumers may exercise their consumer rights included in section 3 of this act, including how a consumer may appeal a controller's decision with regard to the consumer's request;

    v. The categories of personal data that the controller transfers to third parties, if any, and the purposes for those transfers;

    vi. The categories of third parties, if any, to which the controller transfers personal data;

    vii. The length of time the controller intends to retain each category of personal data, or, if it is not possible to identify the length of time, the criteria used to determine the length of time the controller intends to retain categories of personal data; and

    viii. An active email address or other online mechanism that the consumer may use to contact the controller.

    b. If a controller makes a material change to its privacy notice, the controller shall notify each consumer affected by the material change before implementing the material change with respect to prospectively collected personal data and provide a reasonable opportunity for each consumer to withdraw consent. A controller should provide a reasonable opportunity for each consumer to affirmatively consent to further materially different processing or transfer of previously collected personal data under the changed policy. The controller shall take all reasonable electronic measures to provide direct notification regarding material changes to the privacy notice to each affected consumer, taking into account available technology and the nature of the relationship.

10. If a controller sells personal data to third parties or processes personal data for targeted advertising, the controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose such selling or processing, as well as the manner in which a consumer may exercise the right to opt out of such selling or processing. The sale of consumer health data must comply with RCW 19.373.030.

## Section 7
    a. Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as is reasonably practicable, assisting the controller in fulfilling the controller's obligation to respond to consumer rights requests;

    b. Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, assisting the controller in meeting the controller's obligation in relation to the security of processing the personal data and in relation to the notification of a breach of the security of the processor's system in order to meet the controller's obligations; and

    c. Providing necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and document data protection assessments.

2. The processor's data processing procedures with respect to processing performed on behalf of the controller must be governed by a contract between a controller and a processor. The contract must be binding and must clearly set forth instructions for processing data, the nature and purpose of processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of processing, and the rights and obligations of both parties. The processor shall adhere to the instructions of the controller and only process and transfer data it receives from the controller to the extent necessary to provide a service requested by the controller, as set out in the contract. The contract must also require that the processor:

    a. Ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to that data;

    b. At the controller's direction, delete or return all personal data to the controller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data is required by law;

    c. Upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all information in its possession necessary to demonstrate the processor's compliance with this chapter;

    d. After providing the controller an opportunity to object, engage any subcontractor pursuant to a written contract that requires the subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data;

    e. Be prohibited from combining personal data that the processor receives from or on behalf of a controller with personal data that the processor receives from or on behalf of another person or collects from the interaction of the processor with an individual; and

    f. Allow and cooperate with reasonable assessments by the controller or the controller's designated assessor or arrange for a qualified and independent assessor to conduct an assessment of the processor's policies and technical and organizational measures in support of the obligations under this chapter, using an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and assessment procedure for such assessments. The processor shall provide a report of such assessment to the controller upon request.

3. A processor shall establish, implement, and maintain administrative, technical, and physical data security practices that, at a minimum, satisfy reasonable standard of care within the processor's industry to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of personal data appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal data at issue.

4. Nothing in this section may be construed to relieve a controller or processor from the liabilities imposed on the controller or processor by virtue of the controller's or processor's role in the processing relationship, as described in this chapter.

5. Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific processing of personal data is a fact-based determination that depends on the context in which personal data is to be processed. A person who is not limited in the processing of personal data pursuant to a controller's instructions, or who fails to adhere to such instructions, is a controller and not a processor with respect to that specific processing of personal data. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor. If a processor begins, alone or jointly with others, determining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, the processor is a controller with respect to such processing and may be subject to an enforcement action under this chapter.

## Section 8
1. A controller may not conduct processing that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer without conducting and documenting a data protection assessment for each of the controller's processing activities that presents the heightened risk of harm to a consumer. For the purposes of this section, processing that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer includes:

    a. The collection or processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising;

    b. The sale of personal data;

    c. The processing of personal data for the purposes of profiling, where such profiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:

        i. Unfair or deceptive treatment of consumers or unlawful disparate impact on consumers;

        ii. Financial, physical, or reputational injury to consumers;

        iii. A physical or other intrusion upon the solitude, seclusion, or the private affairs or concerns of consumers, where such intrusion would be offensive to a reasonable person; or

        iv. Other substantial injury to consumers; and

    d. The collection or processing of sensitive data.

2. Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection (1) of this section must identify the categories of personal data collected, the purposes for collecting personal data, and whether personal data is being transferred. Data protection assessments must also identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and indirectly, from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other stakeholders, and the public against the potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with such processing, as mitigated by safeguards that are employed by the controller to reduce such risks. The controller shall factor into any data protection assessment the use of deidentified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well as the context of the processing and the relationship between the controller and the consumer whose personal data is being processed.

3. [Empty]

    a. A controller shall submit a report of the data protection assessment or evaluation to the attorney general upon request. The report must include a summary of the data protection assessment, and the controller shall make the summary publicly available in a place that is easily accessible to consumers.

    b. The attorney general may require that a controller disclose any data protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the attorney general, and the controller shall make the data protection assessment available to the attorney general upon request. The attorney general may evaluate the data protection assessment for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in this chapter. To the extent any information contained in a data protection assessment disclosed to the attorney general includes information subject to attorney-client privilege or work product protection, the disclosure does not constitute a waiver of such privilege or protection.

4. A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing operations that include similar activities.

5. If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose of complying with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection assessment is deemed to satisfy the requirements of this section if the data protection assessment is reasonably similar in scope and effect to the data protection assessment that would otherwise be conducted pursuant to this section.

6. A controller shall conduct and document a data protection assessment before initiating a processing activity that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer. Throughout the processing activity's life cycle, the controller shall review and update the data protection assessment as often as appropriate, taking into consideration the type, amount, and sensitivity of personal data collected or processed and the level of risk presented by the processing, in order to:

    a. Monitor for harm caused by the processing and adjust safeguards accordingly; and

    b. Ensure that data protection and privacy are considered as the controller makes new decisions with respect to the processing.

7. The first data protection assessment required by this section must be completed no later than one year after the effective date of this section.

## Section 9
1. Any controller in possession of deidentified data shall:

    a. Take technical measures to ensure that the data cannot be associated with an individual;

    b. Publicly commit to maintaining and using deidentified data without attempting to reidentify the data; and

    c. Contractually obligate any recipients of the deidentified data to comply with all provisions of this chapter.

2. Nothing in this chapter may be construed to require a controller or processor to:

    a. Reidentify deidentified data;

    b. Maintain data in an identifiable form; or

    c. Collect, obtain, retain, or access any data or technology in order to be capable of associating an authenticated consumer request with personal data.

3. Nothing in this chapter may be construed to require a controller or processor to comply with an authenticated consumer rights request if the controller:

    a. Is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the personal data or it would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the request with the personal data; and

    b. Does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the specific consumer who is the subject of the personal data, or associate the personal data with other personal data about the same specific consumer.

4. A controller that transfers deidentified data shall exercise reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with any contractual commitments to which the deidentified data is subject and shall take appropriate steps to address any breaches of those contractual commitments.

## Section 10
1. The obligations imposed on controllers and processors under this chapter do not restrict a controller's or processor's ability to:

    a. Comply with federal, state, or local laws, rules, or regulations, except as prohibited by the Washington shield law, chapter 7.115 RCW;

    b. Comply with a civil, criminal, or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena, or summons by federal, state, local, or other governmental authorities;

    c. Cooperate with law enforcement agencies concerning conduct or activity that the controller or processor reasonably and in good faith believes may violate federal, state, or local laws, rules, or regulations;

    d. Investigate, establish, exercise, prepare for, or defend legal claims;

    e. Provide a product or service specifically requested by the consumer;

    f. Perform under a contract to which a consumer is a party, including fulfilling the terms of a written warranty;

    g. Take steps at the request of a consumer prior to entering into a contract;

    h. Take immediate steps to protect an interest that is essential for the life or physical safety of the consumer or another individual, and where the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis;

        i. Prevent, detect, protect against, or respond to security incidents, identity theft, fraud, harassment, malicious or deceptive activities, or any illegal activity targeted at or involving the controller or processor or its services; preserve the integrity or security of systems; or investigate, report, or prosecute those responsible for any such action;

    j. Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all relevant laws and regulations governing such research, if applicable, and is approved, monitored, and governed by an institutional review board, human subjects research ethics review board, or a similar independent oversight entity that determines whether:

        i. The deletion of personal data requested by a consumer pursuant to section 3 of this act is likely to provide substantial benefits that do not exclusively accrue to the controller;

        ii. The expected benefits of the research outweigh the privacy risks; and

        iii. The controller has implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate privacy risks associated with research, including any risks associated with reidentification;

    k. Assist another controller, processor, or third party with any of the obligations under this chapter;

    l. Process personal data for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, community health, or population health, but solely to the extent that such processing is:

        i. Subject to suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights of the consumer whose personal data is being processed; and

        ii. Under the responsibility of a professional subject to confidentiality obligations under federal, state, or local law;

    m. Ensure the data security and integrity of personal data as required by this chapter, protect against spam, or protect and maintain networks and systems, including through diagnostics, debugging, and repairs;

    n. Transfer assets to a third party in the context of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or similar transaction when the third party assumes control, in whole or in part, of the controller's assets, provided that the controller, in a reasonable time prior to the transfer, provides an affected consumer with notice describing the transfer, including the name of the entity receiving the consumer's personal data and the applicable privacy policies of such entity, and a reasonable opportunity to withdraw previously provided consent related to the consumer's personal data and to request the deletion of the consumer's personal data;

    o. Effectuate a product recall pursuant to federal or state law, or to fulfill a warranty;

    p. Conduct medical research in compliance with 45 C.F.R. Part 46 or 21 C.F.R. Part 50 or 56; or

    q. Process personal data previously collected in accordance with this chapter such that the personal data becomes deidentified data, including to:

        i. Conduct internal research to develop, improve, or repair products, services, or technology;

        ii. Identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality; or

        iii. Perform internal operations that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer or reasonably anticipated based on the consumer's existing relationship with the controller, or are otherwise compatible with processing data in furtherance of the provision of a product or service specifically requested by a consumer or the performance of a contract to which the consumer is a party.

2. The obligations imposed on controllers and processors under this chapter do not apply where compliance by a controller or processor would violate an evidentiary privilege under Washington law and do not prevent a controller or processor from providing personal data concerning a consumer to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under Washington law as part of a privileged communication.

3. A controller or processor that discloses personal data in compliance with this chapter to a third-party controller or processor is not in violation of this chapter if the recipient processes such personal data in violation of this chapter, provided that, at the time of disclosing the personal data, the disclosing controller or processor did not have actual knowledge that the recipient would violate this chapter. A third-party controller or processor receiving personal data in compliance with this chapter from a controller or processor is likewise not in violation of this chapter for the transgressions of the controller or processor from which it receives the personal data.

4. Nothing in this chapter may be construed to:

    a. Impose any obligation on a controller or processor that adversely affects the rights or freedoms of any persons including, but not limited to, the rights of any person to freedom of speech or freedom of the press guaranteed in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or under the Washington reporter shield law, chapter 5.68 RCW;

    b. Apply to any person's collection or processing of personal data in the course of the person's purely personal or household activities; or

    c. For private schools approved by the state under chapter 28A.195 RCW and private institutions of higher education as defined in 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1001 et seq., require deletion of personal data that would unreasonably interfere with the provision of education services by or the ordinary operation of the school or institution.

5. [Empty]

    a. Personal data collected or processed by a controller pursuant to this section may be collected or processed to the extent that the collection or processing is:

        i. Strictly necessary and proportionate to the purposes listed in this section, or, in the case of consumer health data, is in compliance with RCW 19.373.030;

        ii. Limited to what is strictly necessary in relation to the specific purpose or purposes listed in this section, or, in the case of consumer health data, in compliance with RCW 19.373.030; and

        iii. Compliant with section 6 of this act.

    b. Personal data processed pursuant to subsection (1)(q) of this section must, where applicable, take into account the nature and purpose or purposes of the processing. Such data must be subject to reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of the personal data, and to reduce reasonably foreseeable risks of harm to consumers relating to such processing of personal data.

6. If a controller collects or processes personal data pursuant to an exemption in this section, the controller bears the burden of demonstrating that such collection or processing qualifies for the exemption and complies with the requirements in subsection (5) of this section.

## Section 11
1. Controllers and processors that collect or process consumer health data may be subject to additional data privacy requirements pursuant to chapter 19.373 RCW.

2. Controllers and processors that collect or process data that is exempt from this chapter may still be considered regulated entities or processors under chapter 19.373 RCW and may be required to comply with obligations under chapter 19.373 RCW.

## Section 12
## Section 13
The rights and obligations covered by this chapter may only be enforced pursuant to section 12 of this act.

## Section 14
Any provision of a contract or agreement of any kind that purports to waive, release, limit in any way, or extinguish the rights of consumers under this chapter is against public policy and is void and unenforceable.

## Section 15
A regulated entity, small business, or processor subject to the requirements of this chapter may also be subject to data privacy requirements provided in chapter 19.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 17 of this act).

## Section 16
If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.

## Section 18
Section 12 of this act takes effect August 1, 2026.
