## Section 1
1. When a unit owner or the unit owner's authorized agent files a written inquiry by certified mail with an association regarding one or more topics related to either association governance or operations, or both, the association must respond, in the form of a record, to the unit owner or the unit owner's authorized agent within 30 days after receipt of the inquiry. The association must either give a substantive response to the inquirer or notify the inquirer that a legal opinion or other third-party opinion has been requested.

2. If a legal opinion or other third-party opinion is requested, the association must provide the inquirer with a substantive response, in the form of a record, within 60 days after receipt of the inquiry.

3. An association's failure to provide a substantive response to an inquiry as provided in this section precludes the association from recovering attorneys' fees and costs in any subsequent dispute arising out of the inquiry including, but not limited to, any litigation or mediation, arbitration, or administrative proceedings.

4. The association may adopt reasonable rules and regulations regarding the frequency and manner of responding to inquiries, one of which may be that the association is only obligated to respond to one written inquiry per unit in any 30-day period. In such a case, the association must respond to any additional inquiry or inquiries in the subsequent 30-day period, or periods, as applicable. Nothing in this section precludes a unit owner from asking more than one question as part of a single inquiry.
