<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that restricting investment in Washington's cannabis industry solely to Washington residents has created a significant and unnecessary barrier, one that does not exist in other state-regulated cannabis markets or any other industry nationwide. This restriction prevents cannabis businesses from accessing the standard tools needed for growth and innovation. While current regulations permit lending and financing, direct investment, such as angel investment, venture capital, and equity investment, is a critical mechanism for businesses across all industries to expand, particularly for those lacking personal wealth. Without access to these resources, small businesses are left at a distinct disadvantage compared to larger, well-funded ventures and competitors in other states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that this restriction was originally enacted when Washington became the first state to legalize cannabis, as a precaution to avoid potential federal enforcement. However, as cannabis legalization has expanded across the nation, every other state with legal cannabis has adopted regulatory structures without such a residency requirement. To date, no federal action has been taken against these states' systems, underscoring the outdated nature of Washington's restrictive policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that eliminating the in-state residency requirement for investors is essential to creating a level playing field. At the same time, maintaining strict transparency requirements for all qualified investors ensures accountability and preserves the integrity of Washington's cannabis industry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also recognizes that a well-balanced regulatory structure fosters economic growth while preserving the state's high regulatory standards. Such a framework is essential for maintaining a vibrant and sustainable cannabis marketplace that serves all Washingtonians. However, oversupply issues have arisen from the issuance of excessive producer licenses, creating uncertainty in the market. Suspending inactive producer licenses until an interstate or federal cannabis marketplace is established will address this challenge and promote stability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to expand access to investment opportunities for Washington's cannabis businesses, empower locally grown and produced cannabis enterprises to compete effectively in the national market, support smaller, community-based businesses in building resilience against larger, well-capitalized entities, and address oversupply challenges by suspending inactive producer licenses until a federal marketplace emerges.</p>

<p>The incorporated city or town through the official or employee selected by it, the county legislative authority or the official or employee selected by it, the tribal government, or port authority has the right to file with the board within twenty days after the date of transmittal of the notice for applications, or at least thirty days prior to the expiration date for renewals, written objections against the applicant or against the premises for which the new or renewed license is asked.

<li>
<p>A city, county, or town may permit the licensing of premises within 1,000 feet but not less than 100 feet of the facilities described in (a) of this subsection, except elementary schools, secondary schools, and playgrounds, by enacting an ordinance authorizing such distance reduction, provided that such distance reduction will not negatively impact the jurisdiction's civil regulatory enforcement, criminal law enforcement interests, public safety, or public health.</p>

<li>
<p>A city, county, or town may permit the licensing of research premises allowed under RCW 69.50.372 within 1,000 feet but not less than 100 feet of the facilities described in (a) of this subsection by enacting an ordinance authorizing such distance reduction, provided that the ordinance will not negatively impact the jurisdiction's civil regulatory enforcement, criminal law enforcement, public safety, or public health.</p>

<p>The board may license premises located in compliance with the distance requirements set in an ordinance adopted under (b) or (c) of this subsection. Before issuing or renewing a research license for premises within 1,000 feet but not less than 100 feet of an elementary school, secondary school, or playground in compliance with an ordinance passed pursuant to (c) of this subsection, the board must ensure that the facility:</p>
<ol type="i">

<p>Is inaccessible to the public and no part of the operation of the facility is in view of the general public; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bears no advertising or signage indicating that it is a cannabis research facility.</p>

<p>In determining whether to grant or deny a license or renewal of any license, the board must give substantial weight to objections from an incorporated city or town or county legislative authority based upon chronic illegal activity associated with the applicant's operations of the premises proposed to be licensed or the applicant's operation of any other licensed premises, or the conduct of the applicant's patrons inside or outside the licensed premises.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The objection to the issuance of a cannabis retail license at the specified location is based on a preexisting local ordinance limiting outlet density in a specific geographic area. For purposes of this subsection (11), a preexisting local ordinance is an ordinance enacted and in effect before the date the applicant submits an application for a cannabis retail license to the board identifying the premises proposed to be licensed. No objection related to the physical location of a proposed premises may be made by a local government under this subsection (11) based on a local ordinance enacted after the date the applicant submits an application for a cannabis retail license to the board identifying the premises proposed to be licensed.</p>

<li>
<p>After January 1, 2024, all cannabis licensees are encouraged but are not required to submit a social equity plan to the board. Upon confirmation by the board that a cannabis licensee who is not a social equity applicant, and who does not hold a social equity license issued under RCW 69.50.335, has submitted a social equity plan, the board must within 30 days reimburse such a licensee an amount equal to the cost of the licensee's annual cannabis license renewal fee. The license renewal fee reimbursement authorized under this subsection is subject to the following limitations:</p>
