# HB 1391 - Court alternatives/youth

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1391-S2.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that youth diverted from the justice system have lower likelihood for future arrests, higher rates of school completion and college enrollment, and earn higher incomes in adulthood than youth who are adjudicated through the court process.

2. The legislature further finds that there is significant cost benefit to offering youth diversion. A 2019 Washington state institute for public policy analysis found that diverting youth returned a societal benefit of more than $11,000 per dollar spent due to lower recidivism rates and improved outcomes.

3. The legislature also finds that diversion is offered at different rates in different counties, leading to justice by geography and pointing to opportunities to expand the use of diversion in Washington.

4. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to strengthen the ability of courts to offer robust diversion services and improve the data and accountability framework for diversions in Washington state.

The diversion unit shall also immediately refer the case to the prosecuting attorney for action if such juvenile violates the terms of the diversion agreement.

A signed acknowledgment of such advisement shall be obtained from the juvenile, and the document shall be maintained by the unit, and a copy of the document shall be delivered to the prosecutor if requested by the prosecutor. The supreme court shall promulgate rules setting forth the content of such advisement in simple language. A juvenile determined to be eligible by a diversion unit for release as provided in this subsection shall retain the same right to counsel and right to have his or her case referred to the court for formal action as any other juvenile referred to the unit.

15. A diversion unit may supervise the fulfillment of a diversion agreement entered into before the juvenile's 18th birthday and which includes a period extending beyond the divertee's 18th birthday.

16. If restitution required by a diversion agreement cannot reasonably be paid due to a change of circumstance, the diversion agreement may be modified at the request of the divertee and with the concurrence of the diversion unit to convert unpaid restitution into community restitution.
