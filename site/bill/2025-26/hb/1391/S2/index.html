<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that youth diverted from the justice system have lower likelihood for future arrests, higher rates of school completion and college enrollment, and earn higher incomes in adulthood than youth who are adjudicated through the court process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that there is significant cost benefit to offering youth diversion. A 2019 Washington state institute for public policy analysis found that diverting youth returned a societal benefit of more than $11,000 per dollar spent due to lower recidivism rates and improved outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that diversion is offered at different rates in different counties, leading to justice by geography and pointing to opportunities to expand the use of diversion in Washington.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to strengthen the ability of courts to offer robust diversion services and improve the data and accountability framework for diversions in Washington state.</p>

In this order, the court shall also determine the terms and conditions of the restitution, including a payment plan extending up to 10 years if the court determines that the juvenile does not have the means to make full restitution over a shorter period.
