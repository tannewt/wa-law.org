# HB 1643 - Utility facility removal

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1643.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that public roadways are increasingly constructed, altered, repaired, and improved in the public interest as part of development agreements. When this is the case, the legislature believes that a governmental entity requiring a project that is in the public interest to be completed as part of a development agreement should be authorized to require utility relocation at the expense of the franchise holder. The legislature recognizes that, at times, it may be expedient for a governmental entity to require a roadway system improvement to be made instead of assessing an impact fee and undertaking the work itself. The legislature believes that whether a utility franchise holder is required to bear the costs of utility relocation should not be determined on the basis of who is undertaking the project, but rather, on the basis of the extent to which the general public will benefit from the project. Therefore, the legislature intends to authorize the Washington state department of transportation, counties, cities, and towns to require utility franchise holders to pay the expense of utility relocation when a public roadway project that is in the public interest is undertaken by a private entity as part of a development agreement.

## Section 2
1. If the department of transportation deems it to be for the public interest, the franchise may be granted in whole or in part, with or without hearing under such regulations and conditions as the department may prescribe, with or without compensation, but not in excess of the reasonable cost for investigating, handling, and granting the franchise. The department may require that the utility and appurtenances be so placed on the highway that they will, in its opinion, least interfere with other uses of the highway.

2. If a hearing is held, it must be conducted by the department, and may be adjourned from time to time until completed. The applicant may be required to produce all facts pertaining to the franchise, and evidence may be taken for and against granting it.

3. [Empty]

    a. The facility must be made subject to removal when necessary for the construction, alteration, repair, or improvement of the highway and at the expense of the franchise holder, except that the state shall pay the share of the cost of the removal in the amount the state is entitled to receive in the form of reimbursement  from the United States .

    b. Facility removal or relocation at the expense of the franchise holder may be required when necessary for the construction, alteration, repair, or improvement of the highway, subject to the exception in (a) of this subsection, when:

        i. The project is carried out by a private entity as a condition of development; and

        ii. The department finds that the project is in the public interest and has been included in a published local or state plan or program.

    c. Renewal upon expiration of a franchise must be by application.

    d. For the purposes of this subsection, "public interest" means of general benefit to the public.

4. A person constructing or operating such a utility on a state highway is liable to any person injured thereby for any damages incident to the work of installation or the continuation of the occupancy of the highway by the utility, and except as provided above, is liable to the state for all necessary expenses incurred in restoring the highway to a permanent suitable condition for travel. A person constructing or operating such a utility on a state highway is also liable to the state for all necessary expenses incurred in inspecting the construction and restoring the pavement or other related transportation equipment or facilities to a permanent condition suitable for travel and operation in accordance with requirements set by the department. Permit and franchise holders are also financially responsible to the department for trenching work not completed within the contractual period and for compensating for the loss of useful pavement life caused by trenching. No franchise may be granted for a longer period than 50 years, and no exclusive franchise or privilege may be granted.

5. The holder of a franchise granted under this section is financially responsible to the department for trenching work not completed within the period of the permit and for compensating for the loss of useful pavement life caused by trenching. In the case of common trenching operations, liability under this subsection will be assessed equally between the franchisees. The assessed parties may thereafter pursue claims of contribution or indemnity in accord with such fault as may be determined by arbitration or other legal action.

## Section 3
1. Any person constructing or operating any utility on or along a county road shall be liable to the county for all necessary expense incurred in restoring the county road to a suitable condition for travel.

    b. Facility removal or relocation at the expense of the franchise holder may be required when a road is to be constructed, altered, repaired, or improved, and:

        ii. The county finds that the project is in the public interest and has been included in a published local or state plan or program.

In calculating the date that relocation must be completed, cities shall consult with affected service providers and consider the extent of facilities to be relocated, the services requirements, and the construction sequence for the relocation, within the city's overall project construction sequence and constraints, to safely complete the relocation. Service providers shall complete the relocation by the date specified, unless the city, or a reviewing court, establishes a later date for completion, after a showing by the service provider that the relocation cannot be completed by the date specified using best efforts and meeting safety and service requirements.
