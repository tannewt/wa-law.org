<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Analyzing how funding has been allocated and spent since the project restart in 2019, comparing actual expenditures against initial funding plans and subsequent legislative approvals;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analyzing the contract with the general engineering consultant, including all supplements, and assessing the general engineering consultant's overhead and any other source of profit compared to other large transportation projects including, but not limited to, the Brent Spence bridge between Kentucky and Ohio; the Key bridge in Baltimore, Maryland; the I-10 Calcasieu river bridge in Louisiana; the Alligator river bridge in North Carolina; and other large transportation projects in the Pacific Northwest;</p>
