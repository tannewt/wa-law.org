2. During the first seven days of a state of emergency, as declared by the governor or the president of the United States, a transportation network company may not charge a fare for transportation network company services provided to any passenger that exceeds two and one-half times the fare that would otherwise be applicable for the prearranged ride.

4. A violation of this section affects the public interest and constitutes an unlawful and unfair practice under chapter 19.86 RCW.

## Section 2
1. Except as provided in subsections (2) , (3), and (6) of this section, as of June 9, 2022, the state preempts the field of regulating transportation network companies and drivers. No county, city, town, or other municipal corporation may regulate transportation network companies or drivers, or impose any tax, fee, or other charge, on a transportation network company or driver.

2. [Empty]

    a. Except as provided in (b) and (c) of this subsection, a local ordinance or regulation, in a city with a population of more than 600,000 or a county with a population of more than 2,000,000, existing on or before January 1, 2022, that imposes a tax, fee, or other charge on a transportation network company or driver, remains in effect at the rate that exists on or before January 1, 2022. The city or county may continue to collect that tax, fee, or other charge, but may not increase the amount of that tax, fee, or other charge, and may not impose any higher or new taxes, fees, or other charges.

    c. Any per ride fee imposed by a local ordinance or regulation described in (a) of this subsection, the proceeds of which are used to offset expenses of enforcing the ordinance or regulation, may be adjusted under the following provisions:

        i. The city or county demonstrates to the satisfaction of the department that the revenues from the existing per ride fee amount are insufficient to offset the city's or county's cost from enforcement and regulation;

        ii. The total amount expected to be collected under the increased amount will not exceed the city or county's total expected costs; and

        iii. The department has not authorized an increase in the per ride fee in the last two fiscal years.
