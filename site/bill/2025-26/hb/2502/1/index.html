<li>
<p>The legislature finds that local governments, like cities and counties, are a critical component of Washington's governing structure. They deliver essential daily services such as law enforcement, roads, bridges, public health, behavioral health, veterans services, building and permitting, and many more, implement state laws at the community level, and act as the government layer closest to the residents and the most responsive to community issues. They form the foundation for effective state policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For local governments to be successful, they must have adequate funding. Previous reports have highlighted significant local government funding challenges in the state, stemming from state and federal funding cuts, inherent fiscal constraints such as limited property tax revenue growth, and rising costs for services, including labor, public safety, insurance, and inflation, among others. A January 1988 study by the Washington state local governance study commission titled &quot;The Quiet Crisis of Local Governance in Washington&quot; found that, for local governments, &quot;revenues are inadequate for the services they are expected or required to perform.&quot; A December 2007 study by the department of community, trade, and economic development titled &quot;County Financial Health and Governance Alternatives&quot; reported that &quot;counties' revenue base has become more inelastic over the last decade, significantly contributing to fiscal distress and jeopardizing equal access across the state to basic services provided by counties.&quot; In August 2010 the state treasurer report titled &quot;Local Government Financial Health Indicators&quot; claimed &quot;the financial condition of Washington's local governments has generally declined between 2004 and 2008 based on the selected stress indicators.&quot; An August 2014 report by the state auditor titled &quot;Progress Report: Local Government Financial Health&quot; found that &quot;local governments continue to face the fiscally challenging combination of rising costs and constrained revenues that could jeopardize their financial stability long after the state and national economies fully recover.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature has considered numerous proposals to address the fiscal distress of local governments since these reports have been published, but no significant policy changes to improve the fiscal health of local governments have been adopted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The joint legislative audit and review committee has identified 111 sales and use tax preferences in the Revised Code of Washington that impact state and local government revenues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to be careful and prudent when implementing tax preferences. Additionally, the law requires regular review of existing tax preferences to determine if the preference achieves the legislature's objectives, who benefits from the preference, how much the preference costs, and other issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The average combined sales tax rate in the state is 9.4 percent. The average combined rate includes the state base rate of 6.5 percent and an average local rate of 2.9 percent. While most sales and use tax preferences exempt specific products and services from both state and local taxes, RCW 82.08.985 does not include local sales taxes. Without including an exemption from local sales taxes, payers still receive a significant benefit by saving most of the sales tax. The legislature finds that maintaining the exemption for the state base sales tax rate and not including an exemption for local sales taxes achieves the legislature's objective with certain sales tax preferences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to improve the fiscal health of local governments by removing the sales tax exemptions for certain products and services and by following the example in RCW 82.08.985 to limit the sales tax exemptions for other specific products and services to only the state portion.</p>
