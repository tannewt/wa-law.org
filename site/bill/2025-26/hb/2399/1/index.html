<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that a post-loss assignment of benefits in property claims is a contractual agreement that, once signed, transfers the insurance claim rights and benefits within the policyholder's insurance policy to a third party. This contractual arrangement usually involves a restoration or mitigation contractor doing some, or all, of the repairs of the covered property. This assignment agreement is different than the policyholder authorizing direct payment to the restoration or mitigation contractor from the insurance company. It is also different than the assignment clause found in the conditions section within a property policy that prohibits the policyholder from assigning the policy to another entity unless approved by the insurance company.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that a post-loss assignment agreement can allow, but not limit, the third party to: Collect insurance payments without the involvement of the policyholder; restrict communications on the claim to prohibit the policyholder's involvement; and sue the insurance company without the consent of the policyholder.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that the basis of the relationship between the policyholder and the policyholder's insurance company is one affected by the public interest. The consumer protections in claims handling as set forth in the insurance code are intended for the benefit of the policyholder. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature that the policyholder be the entity that has control of the policyholder's property claim with the policyholder's insurer.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
