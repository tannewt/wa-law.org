# HB 2720 - Behavioral health services

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2720.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. Behavioral health crisis services are cost-effective and reduce burdens on other emergency systems. According to the all payer claims database from 2022 through 2024, aggregate health plan claims payments for hospital emergency department visits where patients have primary mental health diagnoses cost far more than behavioral health crisis services;

    b. Behavioral health crisis services which include, but are not limited to, mobile crisis response, crisis relief centers, and crisis stabilization units, provide customized care specific to behavioral health conditions that support people to recover as a more effective alternative to hospital emergency departments;

    c. By giving first responders, family members, and people with behavioral health conditions a place to go and someone to respond in a crisis, behavioral health crisis services help people avoid overburdened emergency departments, inpatient hospitals, and jails;

    d. Behavioral health crisis services should be available to all regardless of insurance status, residency, age, or diagnosis, similar to medical emergency services;

    e. The substance abuse and mental health services administration recommends a comprehensive, 24/7, community-based crisis system that is funded under a firehouse model rather than through traditional insurance reimbursement;

    f. RCW 48.43.093 requires health carriers to cover behavioral health emergency services for people enrolled in their health plans. Federal and state mental health parity laws require private health insurance to provide comparable coverage of medical and behavioral health emergency services;

    g. Despite ongoing efforts from the office of the insurance commissioner, behavioral health administrative services organizations, behavioral health agencies, and health carriers to implement this coverage requirement, payments for behavioral health emergency services by private health plans remain limited. This is due in part to the challenges of obtaining health insurance information when a client is experiencing a behavioral health crisis or its aftermath and to the complexity of billing private health insurers given limited administrative capacity and billing expertise of behavioral health crisis providers. Due to these structural barriers, there are not clear and consistent systems for payments for behavioral health crisis services by health carriers as required by RCW 48.43.093. As a result, Washington state taxpayers have been subsidizing this care;

    h. Behavioral health administrative services organizations are best positioned to administer and implement the array of community-based behavioral health crisis services that a region needs and its providers can deliver, within their limited available resources, given their role as regional behavioral health crisis services authorities under RCW 71.24.045;

        i. A streamlined payment mechanism is needed to sustain access to behavioral health crisis services and to ensure that private health insurers provide the financial contribution for these services that RCW 48.43.093 and mental health parity laws are intended to result in; and

    j. Communities throughout Washington are seeking to expand access to behavioral health crisis care by establishing new facilities, often with state capital funding, but neither state funding nor private health insurance funding is sufficient to support services in these facilities. Too many have been unable to start providing services in their community.

2. The legislature intends to create a broad-based, ongoing, dedicated funding source for behavioral health crisis services provided to people that are not eligible for medicaid reimbursement, and for people who are not enrolled in medicaid.
