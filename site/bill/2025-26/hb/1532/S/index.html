<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that additional funding tools are needed to improve community vitality in the industrial and warehousing valley located near the port of Seattle and the port of Tacoma. Sales tax sourcing laws created a significant negative fiscal impact on this community thereby impacting the quality of life of residents in the valley. The valley is a vital job center to Washington state's economy and is one of the most diverse communities in the state. At the same time, with a concentration of warehousing, manufacturing, and shipping businesses, this community experiences negative impacts on resources that other communities do not experience. Furthermore, the legislature recognizes the dedicated funding in RCW 82.14.545 for the manufacturing and warehousing job centers account, RCW 82.14.550, is scheduled to expire on July 1, 2026. The legislature hereby authorizes new funding tools for these communities to generate revenue necessary to improve community vitality.</p>
