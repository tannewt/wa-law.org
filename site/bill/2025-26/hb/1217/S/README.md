# HB 1217 - Residential tenants

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1217-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. The state is in the midst of a housing affordability crisis. Homes cannot be built fast enough to meet the urgent need to keep families, seniors, and all Washington renters housed.

    b. Residential rents and manufactured/mobile home lot rents have increased at a rate that outpaces inflation, wage growth, cost of living adjustments for programs like social security, and other standard economic metrics that drive price increases. In October 2024, the United States census bureau reported that 15 percent of renter households in Washington received a rent increase of over $250 ($3,000 per year). The United States census bureau also reported that Black households received higher rent increases than other racial groups and that almost a quarter of Black renters received rent increases of over $250 per month. In addition, 57 percent of renter households with children under the age of 18 received a rent increase of over $100, while 22 percent received rent increases of over $250.

    c. Tenants in residential and manufactured/mobile home settings are subject to not only excessive rent increases, but also to the addition of new recurring or periodic fees that can have the effect of drastically increasing monthly housing costs. Tenants also experience arbitrary one-time fees or the addition of fees for services that were previously provided at no cost. Combined with rent increases, these fees create significant additional financial strains for renter households.

    d. According to the 2021 American community survey, nearly one out of every four renters in the state of Washington is over the age of 55. Households of color are disproportionately renters, and these households, as well as Hispanic households, are majority renter households.

    e. Excessive rent increases force renter households, including families, seniors, and young people, to lose housing opportunities. Due to excessive rent increases, renter households are increasingly unable to afford housing in communities of opportunity and are being forced to move away from their communities. Renter households are forced to make tough and often impossible decisions between paying the rent and paying for other basic necessities such as medicine, child care, and transportation. Communities, employers, and workers all suffer when businesses cannot retain or hire staff because workers have to move due to excessive rent increases, a phenomenon especially common for the service industry in heavy tourism areas.

2. The legislature declares that failure to act urgently to protect Washingtonians from excessive rent increases will result in continued harm for millions of residents, especially when considering the essential nature of housing. Therefore, the legislature intends to enact rent stabilization policies in order to preserve the public peace, health, or safety of the state by providing Washington renters with predictability, transparency, and the same protections afforded to other consumers.

## Section 101
1. [Empty]

    a. Except as authorized by an exemption under section 102 of this act, a landlord may not increase the rent and fees combined for any type of tenancy, regardless of whether the tenancy is month-to-month or for a term greater or lesser than month-to-month:

        i. During the first 12 months after the tenancy begins; and

        ii. During any 12-month period, in an amount greater than seven percent.

    b. This subsection (1) of this section applies to all tenancies subject to this chapter, including any such tenancies in dwelling units operated as short-term rentals and vacation rentals.

2. If a landlord increases the rent and fees combined above the amount allowed in subsection (1) of this section as authorized by an exemption under section 102 of this act, the landlord must include facts supporting any claimed exemptions in the written notice of the rent increase. Notice must comply with this section, section 103 of this act, RCW 59.18.140, and be served in accordance with RCW 59.12.040.

3. If a landlord increases rent and fees combined above the amount allowed in subsection (1) of this section and the increase is not authorized by an exemption under section 102 of this act, the tenant may, in addition to any other remedies or relief available under this chapter or other law, terminate the rental agreement at any time prior to the effective date of the increase by providing the landlord with written notice at least 20 days before terminating the rental agreement. If a tenant terminates a rental agreement under this subsection, the tenant only owes pro rata rent through the date upon which the tenant vacates the dwelling unit. A landlord may not charge a tenant any fines or fees for terminating a rental agreement under this subsection.

4. A landlord may not charge a higher rent or fees or include terms of payment or other material conditions in a rental agreement that are more burdensome to a tenant for a month-to-month rental agreement than for a rental agreement where the term is greater or lesser than month-to-month, or vice versa.

5. A landlord who engages in practices in violation of this section, section 102 of this act, section 103 of this act, RCW 59.18.140, 59.18.170, 59.18.200, 59.18.270, or 59.18.650 is liable for:

    a. Damages in the amount of any excess rent, fees, or other costs paid by the tenant;

    b. Mandatory damages equal to three months of any unlawful rent, fees, or other costs charged by the landlord; and

    c. Reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in bringing the action.

6. The remedies provided by this section are in addition to any other remedies provided by law, including the remedies provided for in section 104 of this act.

7. It is a defense to an eviction or other legal action that the action to remove the tenant and recover possession of the premises was for nonpayment of rent or fees that were unlawfully increased in violation of this section.

8. A landlord may not report the tenant to a tenant screening service provider for failure to pay rent or fees that were unlawfully increased in violation of this section.

9. A local government may adopt policies, ordinances, or other regulations to enforce this act.

## Section 102
1. A landlord may increase rent and fees combined in an amount greater than allowed under section 101 of this act only as authorized by the exemptions described in this section. Rent and fee increases are not limited by section 101 of this act for any of the following types of tenancies:

    a. A tenancy in a dwelling unit for which the first certificate of occupancy was issued 10 or less years before the date of the notice of the rent increase.

    b. A tenancy in a dwelling unit owned by a:

        i. Public housing authority;

        ii. Public development authority;

        iii. Nonprofit organization, where maximum rents are regulated by other laws or local, state, or federal affordable housing program requirements; or

        iv. Nonprofit entity, as defined in RCW 84.36.560, where a nonprofit organization, housing authority, or public development authority has the majority decision-making power on behalf of the general partner, and where maximum rents are regulated by other laws or local, state, or federal affordable housing program requirements; or

    c. A tenancy in a qualified low-income housing development as defined in RCW 82.45.010, where the property is owned by any of the organizations described in (b)(i) through (iv) of this subsection.

    d. A tenancy in a dwelling unit in which the tenant shares a bathroom or kitchen facility with the owner who maintains a principal residence at the residential real property.

    e. A tenancy in a single-family owner-occupied residence, including a residence in which the owner-occupant rents or leases no more than two units or bedrooms including, but not limited to, an attached or detached accessory dwelling unit.

    f. A tenancy in a duplex in which the owner occupied one of the units as the owner's principal place of residence at the beginning of the tenancy, so long as the owner continues the occupancy.

2. Subsection (1)(d) through (f) of this section only apply where the owner is not any of the following:

    a. A real estate investment trust, as defined in section 856 of the internal revenue code;

    b. A corporation; or

    c. A limited liability company in which at least one member is a corporation.

## Section 103
1. A landlord must provide a tenant with annual notice of rent and fee increases in substantially the following form. Notice under this section must comply with the requirements in RCW 59.18.140 and be served in accordance with RCW 59.12.040.

2. The annual notice of rent increase requirement in this section does not apply if the rental agreement governs a subsidized tenancy where the amount of rent is based on, in whole or in part, a percentage of the income of the tenant or other circumstances specific to the subsidized household. However, for purposes of this section, a subsidized tenancy does not include tenancies where some or all of the rent paid to the landlord comes from a portable tenant-based voucher or similar portable assistance administered through a housing authority or other state or local agency, or tenancies in other types of affordable housing where maximum unit rents are limited by area median income levels and a tenant's base rent does not change as the tenant's income does.

RENT AND FEE INCREASE NOTICE TO TENANTS

This notice is required by Washington state law to inform you of your rights regarding rent and fee increases. Washington state limits how much your landlord can raise your rent and fees.

1. Your landlord can raise your rent and fees combined once every 12 months by up to seven percent, as allowed by section 101 of this act. Your landlord is not required to raise the rent or fees by any amount.

2. Your landlord may be exempt from the seven percent limit on rent and fee increases for the reasons described in section 102 of this act. If your landlord claims an exemption, your landlord is required to include supporting facts with this notice.

3. Your landlord must properly and fully complete the form below to notify you of any rent and fee increases and any exemptions claimed.

Your landlord (name) intends to (check one of the following):

__ Raise your rent and/or fees: Your total rent and fee increase effective (date) will be (percent), which totals an additional $(dollar amount) per month, for a new total amount of $(dollar amount) per month for rent and fees combined.

This rent and/or fee increase is allowed by state law and is (check one of the following):

__ A lower rent and/or fee increase than the maximum allowed by state law.

__ The maximum rent and/or fee increase allowed by state law.

__ Authorized by an exemption under section 102 of this act. If the rent and/or fee increase is authorized by an exemption, your landlord must fill out the section of the form below.

EXEMPTIONS CLAIMED BY LANDLORD

Under penalty of perjury, I (landlord name) certify that I am allowed under Washington state law to raise your rent and fees by (percent), which is more than the maximum increase otherwise allowed by state law, because I am claiming the following exemption under section 102 of this act (check one of the following):

__ The first certificate of occupancy for your dwelling unit was issued on (insert date), which is 10 or less years before the date of this rent and fee increase notice, so the maximum allowable rent and fee increase limit in section 101 of this act does not apply. (The landlord must include facts or attach documents supporting the exemption.)

__ You live in a dwelling unit owned by a public housing authority, public development authority, or nonprofit organization where maximum rents are regulated by other laws or local, state, or federal affordable housing program requirements, or a qualified low-income housing development as defined in RCW 82.45.010, where the property is owned by a public housing authority, public development authority, or nonprofit organization. (The landlord must include facts or attach documents supporting the exemption.)

__ You live in a dwelling unit in which you share a bathroom or kitchen facility with the owner, and the owner maintains a principal residence at the residential real property. (The landlord must include facts or attach documents supporting the exemption.)

__ You live in a single-family residence in which the owner leases no more than two units or bedrooms including, but not limited to, an attached or detached accessory dwelling unit. (The landlord must include facts or attach documents supporting the exemption.)

__ You live in a duplex in which the owner occupied one of the units as the owner's principal place of residence at the beginning of the tenancy, and the owner continues in occupancy. (The landlord must include facts or attach documents supporting the exemption.)"

A violation of section 101 of this act, section 102 of this act, section 103 of this act, RCW 59.18.140, 59.18.170, 59.18.200, 59.18.270, or 59.18.650 by a landlord is not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business and is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce and an unfair method of competition for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW.

## Section 105
1. The department of commerce shall create an online landlord resource center to distribute information to landlords about available programs and resources including, but not limited to, the following:

        i. A full digital version available on the office of the attorney general's website; and

    d. The office of the attorney general shall publish the first version of the model lease provisions regarding rent and fee increases by January 1, 2026, and shall periodically publish new versions of the model lease provisions as necessary to incorporate any relevant changes made to this chapter.

## Section 106
1. The tenant shall conform to all reasonable obligations or restrictions, whether denominated by the landlord as rules, rental agreement, rent, or otherwise, concerning the use, occupation, and maintenance of his or her dwelling unit, appurtenances thereto, and the property of which the dwelling unit is a part if such obligations and restrictions are not in violation of any of the terms of this chapter and are not otherwise contrary to law, and if such obligations and restrictions are brought to the attention of the tenant at the time of his or her initial occupancy of the dwelling unit and thus become part of the rental agreement.

2. Except for termination of tenancy and an increase in the amount of rent, after 30 days written notice to each affected tenant, a new rule of tenancy may become effective upon completion of the term of the rental agreement or sooner upon mutual consent.

3. [Empty]

    a. Except as provided in (b) and (c) of this subsection, a landlord shall provide a minimum of 60 days' prior written notice of an increase in the amount of rent to each affected tenant, and any increase in the amount of rent may not become effective prior to the completion of the term of the rental agreement.

    b. If the rental agreement governs a subsidized tenancy where the amount of rent is based on the income of the tenant or circumstances specific to the subsidized household, a landlord shall provide a minimum of 30 days' prior written notice of an increase in the amount of rent to each affected tenant. An increase in the amount of rent may become effective upon completion of the term of the rental agreement or sooner upon mutual consent.

    c. If a landlord intends to increase the rent and fees combined in an amount of three percent or more, the landlord must provide written notice to each affected tenant a minimum of 180 days before the effective date of the increase. This subsection (3)(c) does not apply to any tenancy in a dwelling unit qualifying for an exemption under section 102(1) (b) and (c) of this act.

## Section 107
1. If a landlord charges a tenant any move-in fees or security deposits, the move-in fees and security deposits combined may not exceed one month's rent.

2. All moneys paid to the landlord by the tenant as a deposit as security for performance of the tenant's obligations in a lease or rental agreement shall promptly be deposited by the landlord in a trust account, maintained by the landlord for the purpose of holding such security deposits for tenants of the landlord, in a financial institution as defined by RCW 30A.22.041 or licensed escrow agent located in Washington. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the landlord shall be entitled to receipt of interest paid on such trust account deposits. The landlord shall provide the tenant with a written receipt for the deposit and shall provide written notice of the name and address and location of the depository and any subsequent change thereof. If during a tenancy the status of landlord is transferred to another, any sums in the deposit trust account affected by such transfer shall simultaneously be transferred to an equivalent trust account of the successor landlord, and the successor landlord shall promptly notify the tenant of the transfer and of the name, address, and location of the new depository. If, during the tenancy, the tenant's dwelling unit is foreclosed upon and the tenant's deposit is not transferred to the successor after the foreclosure sale or other transfer of the property from the foreclosed-upon owner to a successor, the foreclosed-upon owner shall promptly refund the full deposit to the tenant immediately after the foreclosure sale or transfer. If the foreclosed-upon owner does not either immediately refund the full deposit to the tenant or transfer the deposit to the successor, the foreclosed-upon owner is liable to the tenant for damages up to two times the amount of the deposit. In any action brought by the tenant to recover the deposit, the prevailing party is entitled to recover the costs of suit or arbitration, including reasonable attorneys' fees. The tenant's claim to any moneys paid under this section shall be prior to that of any creditor of the landlord, including a trustee in bankruptcy or receiver, even if such moneys are commingled.

3. Subsection (1) of this section does not apply if the rental agreement governs a subsidized tenancy where the amount of rent is based on, in whole or in part, a percentage of the income of the tenant or other circumstances specific to the subsidized household. However, for purposes of this section, a subsidized tenancy does not include tenancies where some or all of the rent paid to the landlord comes from a portable tenant-based voucher or similar portable assistance administered through a housing authority or other state or local agency, or tenancies in other types of affordable housing where maximum unit rents are limited by area median income levels and a tenant's base rent does not change as the tenant's income does.

## Section 108
1. If at any time during the tenancy the tenant fails to carry out the duties required by RCW 59.18.130 or 59.18.140, the landlord may, in addition to pursuit of remedies otherwise provided by law, give written notice to the tenant of said failure, which notice shall specify the nature of the failure.

2. The landlord may not charge a late fee for rent that is paid within five days following its due date. If rent is more than five days past due, the landlord may charge late fees commencing from the first day after the due date until paid. Late fees may not exceed 1.5 percent of the tenant's total rent per month. Nothing in this subsection prohibits a landlord from serving a notice to pay or vacate at any time after the rent becomes due.

3. When late fees may be assessed after rent becomes due, the tenant may propose that the date rent is due in the rental agreement be altered to a different due date of the month. The landlord shall agree to such a proposal if it is submitted in writing and the tenant can demonstrate that his or her primary source of income is a regular, monthly source of governmental assistance that is not received until after the date rent is due in the rental agreement. The proposed rent due date may not be more than five days after the date the rent is due in the rental agreement. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent a tenant from making a request for reasonable accommodation under federal, state, or local law.

## Section 201
1. Except as authorized by an exemption under section 202 of this act and as provided in RCW 59.20.060(2)(c), a landlord may not increase the rent and fees combined for any type of tenancy, regardless of whether the tenancy is month-to-month or for a term greater than month-to-month:

    a. During the first 12 months after the tenancy begins; and

    b. During any 12-month period, in an amount greater than seven percent.

2. If a landlord increases the rent and fees combined above the amount allowed in subsection (1) of this section as authorized by an exemption under section 202 of this act, the landlord must include facts supporting any claimed exemptions in the written notice of the rent increase. Notice must comply with this section, section 203 of this act, RCW 59.20.090(2), and be served in accordance with RCW 59.12.040.

3. If a landlord increases rent and fees combined above the amount allowed in subsection (1) of this section and the increase is not authorized by an exemption under section 202 of this act, the tenant may, in addition to any other remedies or relief available under this chapter or other law, terminate the rental agreement at any time prior to the effective date of the increase by providing the landlord with written notice at least 30 days before terminating the rental agreement. If a tenant terminates a rental agreement under this subsection, the tenant only owes pro rata rent through the date upon which the tenant vacates the dwelling unit. A landlord may not charge a tenant any fines or fees for terminating a rental agreement under this subsection.

4. A landlord may not charge a higher rent or fees or include terms of payment or other material conditions in a rental agreement that are more burdensome to a tenant for a month-to-month rental agreement than for a rental agreement where the term is greater than month-to-month, or vice versa.

5. A landlord who engages in practices in violation of this section, section 202 of this act, section 203 of this act, RCW 59.20.060, 59.20.090, or 59.20.170 is liable for:

    a. Damages in the amount of any excess rent, fees, or other costs paid by the tenant;

    b. Mandatory damages equal to three months of any unlawful rent, fees, or other costs charged by the landlord; and

    c. Reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in bringing the action.

6. The remedies provided by this section are in addition to any other remedies provided by law, including the remedies provided for in section 204 of this act.

7. It is a defense to an eviction or other legal action that the action to remove the tenant and recover possession of the premises was for nonpayment of rent or fees that were unlawfully increased in violation of this section.

8. A landlord may not report a tenant to a tenant screening service provider for failure to pay rent or fees that were unlawfully increased in violation of this section.

9. A local government may adopt policies, ordinances, or other regulations to enforce this act.

## Section 202
A landlord may increase rent and fees combined in an amount greater than allowed under section 201 of this act only as authorized by the exemptions described in this section or as provided in RCW 59.20.060(2)(c).

1. Rent and fee increases are not limited by section 201 of this act for any of the following types of tenancies:

    a. A tenancy in a manufactured/mobile home lot owned by a:

        i. Public housing authority;

        ii. Public development authority; or

        iii. Nonprofit organization, where maximum rents are regulated by other laws or local, state, or federal affordable housing program requirements; or

    b. A tenancy in a qualified low-income housing development as defined in RCW 82.45.010, where the property is owned by any of the organizations described in (a)(i) through (iii) of this subsection.

2. During the first 12 months after the qualified sale of a manufactured/mobile home community to an eligible organization as defined in RCW 59.20.030 whose mission aligns with the long-term preservation and affordability of the manufactured/mobile home community, the eligible organization may increase the annual rent and fees combined for the manufactured/mobile home community in an amount greater than allowed under section 201 of this act as needed to cover the cost of purchasing the manufactured/mobile home community if the increase is approved by vote or agreement with the majority of the manufactured/mobile home owners in the manufactured/mobile home community.

3. Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, a tenant shall notify the landlord in writing one month prior to the expiration of a rental agreement of an intention not to renew.

4. [Empty]

    a.

    b. Any tenant who is a member of the armed forces, including the national guard and armed forces reserves, or that tenant's spouse or dependent, may terminate a rental agreement with less than 30 days notice if the tenant receives permanent change of station or deployment orders which do not allow greater notice.
