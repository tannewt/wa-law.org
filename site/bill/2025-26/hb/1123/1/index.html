<li>
<p>Nothing in this section prohibits a contractor from reimbursing a hospital through a nonfee-for-service payment methodology, so long as the payments incentivize higher quality or improved health outcomes and the contractor continues to comply with the reimbursement requirements in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Premiums must take into account changes in reimbursement for hospital, primary care, and behavioral health services anticipated to result from the application of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the request of the authority for monitoring, enforcement, or program and quality improvement activities, a contractor must provide cost and quality of care information and data to the authority and may not enter into an agreement with a provider or third party that would restrict the contractor from providing this information or data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By December 31, 2030, the authority, in consultation with the office of the insurance commissioner, shall provide a report to the governor's office and relevant committees of the legislature analyzing the initial impacts of this section on network access, enrollee premiums, and state expenditures for medical coverage offered to public employees under this chapter. The report may include recommendations for legislative changes to the policy established in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority may adopt rules to implement this section, including rules for levying fines and taking other contract actions it deems necessary to enforce compliance with this section.</p>
