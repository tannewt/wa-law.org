</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section prohibits a contractor from reimbursing a hospital through a nonfee-for-service payment methodology, so long as the payments incentivize higher quality or improved health outcomes and the contractor continues to comply with the reimbursement requirements in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Premiums must take into account changes in reimbursement for hospital, primary care, and behavioral health services anticipated to result from the application of this section.</p>

<p>The authority may adopt rules to implement this section, including rules for levying fines and taking other contract actions it deems necessary to enforce compliance with this section.</p>
</li>
