    b. For firefighters as defined in RCW 41.26.030(17) (a), (b), (c), and (h) and firefighters, including supervisors, employed on a full-time, fully compensated basis as a firefighter of a private sector employer's fire department that includes over fifty such firefighters, and law enforcement officers as defined in RCW 41.26.030(19) (b), (c), and (e) hired after June 7, 2018, and public safety telecommunicators hired after June 11, 2020, (a) of this subsection only applies if the firefighter or law enforcement officer or public safety telecommunicators, as a condition of employment, has submitted to a psychological examination administered by a psychiatrist licensed in the state of Washington under chapter 18.71 RCW or a psychologist licensed in the state of Washington under chapter 18.83 RCW that ruled out the presence of posttraumatic stress disorder from preemployment exposures. If the employer does not provide the psychological examination, (a) of this subsection applies.

## Section 2
1.

2. The presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence.

3. The presumption extends to a claimant following termination of employment for a period of three calendar months for each year the claimant was a correctional facility worker employed on a fully compensated basis, but may not extend more than 60 months following the last date of employment.

    b. When determination involving the presumption established under this section is appealed to any court and the final decision allows the claim for benefits, the court shall order that all reasonable costs of the appeal, including attorneys' fees and witness fees, be paid to the claimant or his or her beneficiary by the opposing party.

    c. When reasonable costs of the appeal must be paid by the department under this section in a state fund case, the costs must be paid from the accident fund and charged to the costs of the claim.
