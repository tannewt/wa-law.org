<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington is experiencing a forest health crisis. Rangeland and forest fires have grown both larger and more damaging in recent years, threatening the health, livelihoods, and homes of Washingtonians. Over the last 10 years, wildfires have burned an average of 470,000 acres across the state. According to the 2020 forest health assessment and treatment framework, approximately 3,000,000 acres in eastern Washington alone are in need of active management or disturbance to improve forest resiliency to stressors such as wildfire and drought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that prescribed fire and cultural burning are one of the most effective, yet underutilized tools to help address the forest health crisis. Most ecosystems in Washington evolved with fire through stewardship by tribal peoples and ignitions like lightning strikes. Prescribed fire and cultural burning remove dead and downed brush and vegetation, providing more management opportunities for fire suppression across a variety of landscapes by proactively removing hazardous fuels. Compared to wildfire smoke, prescribed fire smoke produces up to 50 percent less PM2.5. Fire also returns important nutrients to the soil, revitalizes plant growth, and improves wildlife habitat. Tribes have used cultural burning since time immemorial to sustain healthy and resilient lands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that growing risks of wildfires to communities and the environment generally requires at least a five-fold increase in prescribed burning to effectively reduce accumulated fuels, restore resiliency to landscapes, and protect communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that while prescribed fire escapements are rare, the uncertain financial implications associated with an escapement deter this work despite its low risk. The 2023 Washington prescribed fire barriers assessment report and strategic action plan found that one of the most significant barriers to more prescribed burns has been uncertainty around potential liability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to establish a fire claims fund pilot program to provide loss coverage for prescribed and cultural burns conducted in accordance with applicable requirements. By decreasing the uncertainty associated with these regulated burns, the legislature intends to promote the use of this critical tool for strengthening and protecting our resources and communities.</p>
</li>
