# HB 1688 - Electric security alarms

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1688-S.E.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that recent changes in alarm system technology can be beneficial for protecting property owners from ongoing theft, and may help to minimize the demand on local government policing and judicial resources. The legislature further finds that state and local codes may not currently regulate electric security alarm systems, and that, in such cases, the application of a statewide standard for installation of such systems would be beneficial to industrial and commercial property owners statewide. It is, therefore, the intent of the legislature to establish a statewide standard for the installation and operation of electric security alarm systems in circumstances in which local governments have not provided alternative regulations.

## Section 2
1. Cities and towns that have not adopted an ordinance, land use regulation, or local code related to the regulation of electric security alarm systems shall allow electric security alarm systems consistent with the following:

    a. Electric security alarm systems may not be considered a fence and may not be regulated by fence codes which do not reference and regulate electric security alarm systems.

    b. Electric security alarm systems must be allowed on any allowed or legally nonconforming outdoor storage property. This subsection (1)(b) does not apply to properties zoned for mixed use that are not an outdoor storage property as defined in this section.

    c. The installation of electric security alarm systems must meet the following requirements:

        i. The electric security alarm is powered by an energizer that is driven by a battery of no more than 12 volts of direct current and that does not produce an electric charge on contact that exceeds energizer characteristics set forth in IEC 60335-2-76, as of January 1, 2025;

        ii. The electric security alarm is marked with conspicuous warning signs that are located on the system at not more than 30-foot intervals that read "Warning: Electric Fence.";

        iii. The electric security alarm is 10 feet in height, or two feet higher than the perimeter barrier, fence, or wall, whichever is greater; and

        iv. The electric security alarm includes a device that enables first responders to deactivate the electric security alarm system in response to an emergency, if utilized by a city and town.

    d. A minimum five foot tall perimeter barrier, fence, or wall, is located around the exterior of the electric security alarm system. If the perimeter barrier is an existing fence or wall, the fence or wall must have been installed in compliance with the fence code at the time of installation. The city may require a permit for the installation of a new perimeter fence or wall and may require the new perimeter fence or wall be consistent with the local fence code. The city may not require any additional conditions or improvements appurtenant to the installation of an electric security alarm system.
