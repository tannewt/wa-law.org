<p>The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&quot;Artificial intelligence system&quot; or &quot;AI system&quot; means an engineered or machine-based system that varies in its level of autonomy and that can, for explicit or implicit objectives, infer from the input it receives how to generate outputs that can influence physical or virtual environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Covered provider&quot; means a person that creates, codes, or otherwise produces a generative artificial intelligence system that has over 1,000,000 monthly visitors or users and is publicly accessible within the geographic boundaries of the state. &quot;Covered provider&quot; does not mean government agencies or tribal nations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Generative artificial intelligence system&quot; means an artificial intelligence system that can generate derived synthetic content, including text, images, video, and audio, that emulates the structure and characteristics of the artificial intelligence system's training data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Latent&quot; means present but not manifest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Manifest&quot; means easily perceived, understood, or recognized by a natural person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Metadata&quot; means structural or descriptive information about data.</p>
</li>

<p>&quot;Personal information&quot; has the same meaning as defined in RCW 19.255.005.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Personal provenance data&quot; means provenance data that contains either of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Personal information; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unique device, system, or service information that is reasonably capable of being associated with a particular user.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Provenance data&quot; means data that is embedded into digital content or that is included in the digital content's metadata for the purpose of verifying the digital content's authenticity, origin, or history of modification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;System provenance data&quot; means provenance data that is not reasonably capable of being associated with a particular user and that contains either of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Information regarding the type of device, system, or service that was used to generate a piece of digital content; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information that helps a user assess authenticity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A covered provider shall make available an artificial intelligence detection tool at no cost to the user that meets all of the following criteria:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The tool allows a user to assess whether image, video, or audio content, or content that is any combination thereof, was created or altered by the covered provider's generative artificial intelligence system;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tool outputs any system provenance data that is detected in the content;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tool does not output any personal provenance data that is detected in the content, to the extent technically feasible;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tool is publicly accessible, although a covered provider may impose reasonable limitations on access to the tool to prevent, or respond to, demonstrable risks to the security or integrity of its generative artificial intelligence system;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tool allows a user to upload content or provide a uniform resource locator linking to online content; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tool supports an application programming interface that allows a user to invoke the tool without visiting the covered provider's internet website.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A covered provider shall collect user feedback related to the efficacy of the covered provider's artificial intelligence detection tool and incorporate relevant feedback into any attempt to improve the efficacy of the tool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A covered provider may not do any of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Collect or retain personal information from users of the covered provider's artificial intelligence detection tool, except:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>A covered provider may collect and retain the contact information of a user who submits feedback pursuant to subsection (2) of this section if the user opts in to being contacted by the covered provider; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User information collected may only be used to evaluate and improve the efficacy of the covered provider's artificial intelligence detection tool;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retain any content submitted to the artificial intelligence detection tool for longer than is necessary to comply with this section; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retain any personal provenance data from content submitted to the artificial intelligence detection tool by a user.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A covered provider shall offer the user the option to include a manifest disclosure in image, video, or audio content, or content that is any combination thereof, created or altered by the covered provider's generative artificial intelligence system that meets all of the following criteria:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The disclosure identifies content as AI-generated content;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The disclosure is clear, conspicuous, appropriate for the medium of the content, and understandable to a reasonable person; and</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>If a covered provider knows that a third-party licensee modified a licensed generative artificial intelligence system such that it is no longer capable of including a disclosure required by subsection (2) of this section in content the system creates or alters, the covered provider shall revoke the license within 96 hours of discovering the licensee's action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A third-party licensee shall cease using a licensed generative artificial intelligence system after the license for the system has been revoked by the covered provider pursuant to (b) of this subsection.</p>
