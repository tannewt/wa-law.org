<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that as generative artificial intelligence models become increasingly sophisticated, and the content created by such models proliferates across commonly used platforms, it can be difficult for the public to trust the accuracy, authenticity, or origin of information accessed on the internet. Recent technological advances allow providers of generative artificial intelligence systems to use watermarking and other technologies to label or detect content created using their proprietary models. By ensuring that the public has access to reliable provenance data, the providers of generative artificial intelligence systems can improve the public's ability to assess the accuracy and authenticity of synthetic content, thereby helping to reduce risks of misinformation.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>

<p>If a covered provider licenses its generative artificial intelligence system to a third party, the covered provider shall require by contract that the licensee maintain the system's capability to include a disclosure required by subsection (2) of this section in content the system creates or alters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a covered provider knows that a third-party licensee modified a licensed generative artificial intelligence system such that it is no longer capable of including a disclosure required by subsection (2) of this section in content the system creates or alters, the covered provider shall revoke the license within 96 hours of discovering the licensee's action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A third-party licensee shall cease using a licensed generative artificial intelligence system after the license for the system has been revoked by the covered provider pursuant to (b) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>The attorney general may bring an action in the name of the state, or as parens patriae on behalf of persons residing in the state, to enforce this chapter. For actions brought by the attorney general to enforce this chapter, the legislature finds that the practices covered by this chapter are matters vitally affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW. For actions brought by the attorney general to enforce this chapter, a violation of this chapter is not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business and is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce and an unfair method of competition for purposes of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW.</p>
