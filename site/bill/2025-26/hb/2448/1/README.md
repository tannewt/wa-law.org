# HB 2448 - State expenditure limit

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2448.pdf)

## Section 1
1. For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2027, and each fiscal year thereafter, the state shall not expend from the general fund and related funds in excess of the state expenditure limit established under this chapter.

2. For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2027, and each fiscal year thereafter, the state treasurer shall not issue or redeem any check, warrant, or voucher that will result in a state general fund or related fund expenditure for any fiscal year in excess of the state expenditure limit established under this chapter. A violation of this subsection constitutes a violation of RCW 43.88.290 and subjects the state treasurer to the penalties provided in RCW 43.88.300.

3. The state expenditure limit for any fiscal year is the previous fiscal year's state expenditure limit increased by a percentage rate that equals the fiscal growth factor.

4. For purposes of computing the state expenditure limit for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2027, the phrase "the previous fiscal year's state expenditure limit" means the total state expenditures from the state general fund and related funds, not including federal funds, for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2026, plus the fiscal growth factor.

5. Each November, the economic and revenue forecast council shall adjust the expenditure limit for the preceding fiscal year based on actual expenditures, and known changes in the fiscal growth factor and then project an expenditure limit for the next four fiscal years including any adjustments required under section 2 of this act. If, by November 30th, the economic and revenue forecast council has not adopted the current or projected expenditure limit as provided in this section, the state treasurer shall adjust or project the expenditure limit, as necessary.

## Section 2
1. If moneys are transferred from the state general fund or related funds to another fund or account on or after July 1, 2026, the economic and revenue forecast council, acting pursuant to section 1 of this act, shall lower the state expenditure limit to reflect the shift. For the purposes of this section, a transfer of money from the state general fund or related funds to another fund or account includes any state legislative action taken after July 1, 2026, that has the effect of reducing revenues from a particular source, where such revenues would otherwise be deposited into the state general fund or related funds, while increasing the revenues from that particular source to another state or local government account.

2. If the cost of any state program or function is shifted from the state general fund or related funds on or after July 1, 2026, to another source of funding the economic and revenue forecast council, acting pursuant to section 1 of this act, shall lower the state expenditure limit to reflect the shift. For the purposes of this section, shifting the cost of a state program or function includes shifting current funding, funding growth, or funding program enhancements from a source other than the state general fund or related funds when that program or function has historically been primarily funded by the state general fund or related funds.

3. If the cost of any state program or function and the ongoing revenue necessary to fund the program or function are shifted to the state general fund or a related fund on or after July 1, 2026, from another source of funding, the economic and revenue forecast council, acting pursuant to section 1 of this act, shall increase the state expenditure limit to reflect the shift.

4. If by order of any court, or legislative enactment, the costs of a federal or local government program are transferred to or from the state, the economic and revenue forecast council, acting pursuant to section 1 of this act, shall increase or decrease the state expenditure limit, as the case may be, to reflect the shift.

5. This section does not apply to:

    a. A transfer of moneys to, or an expenditure from, the budget stabilization account;

    b. A transfer of moneys to, or an expenditure from, the tax relief account created in section 8 of this act;

    c. A transfer of moneys, or shifting of program costs, when that transfer or shift impacts only the general fund or related funds and that transfer or shift neither involves nor impacts any other fund source; or

    d. A statutorily required transfer of moneys from the general fund, or a related fund, to any other fund up to the amount required in the version of the statute in effect on January 1, 2026.

## Section 3
The state expenditure limit may be exceeded upon declaration of an emergency for a period not to exceed 24 months by a law approved by a two-thirds vote of each house of the legislature and signed by the governor. The law shall set forth the nature of the emergency, which is limited to natural disasters that require immediate government action to alleviate human suffering and provide humanitarian assistance. The state expenditure limit may be exceeded for no more than 24 months following the declaration of the emergency and only for the purposes contained in the emergency declaration.

## Section 4
1. Each November, the economic and revenue forecast council shall calculate the fiscal growth factor for each fiscal year of the current biennium and the ensuing biennium.

2. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

    a. "Fiscal growth factor" means the average of the sum of inflation and population change for each of the prior three fiscal years.

    b. "General fund" means the state general fund.

    c. "Inflation" means the percentage change in the consumer price index for all urban consumers for the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue area, or successor index, for each fiscal year as published by the federal bureau of labor statistics.

    d. "Population change" means the percentage change in state population for each fiscal year as reported by the office of financial management.

    e. "Related funds" means the Washington opportunity pathways account, the workforce education investment account, the fair start for kids account, and the education legacy trust account.

## Section 5
No state officer or employee shall intentionally or negligently: Over-expend or over-encumber any appropriation made by law; fail to properly account for any expenditures by fund, program, or fiscal period; exceed the state expenditure limit; or expend funds contrary to the terms, limits, or conditions of any appropriation made by law.

## Section 8
1. The tax relief account is created in the state treasury. On June 30th of each fiscal year, the state treasurer shall deposit in the tax relief account all state general fund and related account revenues amounts in excess of the state expenditure limit for that fiscal year. In calculating the transfer, the treasurer must first subtract any transfers from the state general fund to the budget stabilization account pursuant to Article VII, section 12 of the state Constitution. In the event a transfer is required, the transfer amount must come solely from the state general fund.

2. The legislature may appropriate funds from the tax relief account solely to reduce the tax burden borne by those living or doing business in the state of Washington. The legislature may reduce taxes through repeals, tax holidays, reductions to tax rates, tax credits, or any other mechanism authorized by law so long as the relief is broadly based.

3. Moneys in the account may not be transferred to any other account nor used for any purpose other than tax relief.
