<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The share of families reporting difficulty securing a spot in licensed child care jumped from 22 percent in December 2021 to 58 percent in January 2022. The second most cited reason for staffing vacancies in licensed family homes is staffing issues and lack of staff capacity, and nearly 50 percent of child care centers report vacancies because of staffing issues. Licensed child care providers continue to struggle with recruiting and retaining staff in a tight labor market, especially as retail, hospitality, and service industries offer more competitive wages and benefits. Without targeted action, these access gaps in high quality care and their unequal impacts on women are likely to widen;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 2020 child care policy recommendations by the child care collaborative task force recommended full funding for professional development, relationship-based professional development, and financial incentives to support providers in meeting staff qualifications, ongoing continuous quality improvement, and achieving high quality levels in early achievers and school-age quality standards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the Washington advanced college tuition payment program was enacted, the legislature envisioned that establishing a scholarship for those in financial need would be a permissible use of the moneys from the payment program account;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Washington advanced college tuition payment program account in chapter 28B.95 RCW has a surplus of funding and is funded at a level of approximately 178 percent;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In June 2025, the internal revenue service issued an informational letter stating that section 529 of the internal revenue code does not explicitly restrict a state from transferring credit or certificate purchases in a qualified tuition program; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is an appropriate use of a portion of the surplus from the Washington advanced college tuition payment program account to provide financial aid to students enrolled in eligible early childhood education programs.</p>
</li>
