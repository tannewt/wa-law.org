<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that back-to-school shopping places a significant financial burden on families, particularly as the costs of essential supplies, clothing, and technology continue to rise. Families with children in elementary through high school plan to spend an average of $874.68 on clothing, shoes, school supplies, and electronics, making these expenses a substantial challenge for many households.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that inflation and the rising cost of living have made it increasingly difficult for families to afford the necessities their children need to start the school year prepared. Many parents are forced to make difficult financial choices, prioritizing school essentials over other household expenses. A sales tax holiday would provide direct relief, helping families stretch their budgets further during this critical time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that ensuring children have the supplies, clothing, and technology they need is essential for their academic success and overall well-being. No child should have to start the school year without the tools necessary for learning simply because their family cannot afford them. Reducing this financial strain allows parents to focus on supporting their children's education rather than worrying about basic school necessities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that many other states have successfully implemented back-to-school sales tax holidays, recognizing the importance of providing relief to families. These initiatives have proven effective in helping parents manage school-related costs while ensuring students have the resources they need for success. Implementing a similar policy in this state would provide families with the same kind of support already available elsewhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to establish a back-to-school sales tax holiday to provide financial relief for families and support students as they return to the classroom. This policy will help make school-related expenses more manageable and ensure that all children can start the academic year with the supplies they need.</p>
