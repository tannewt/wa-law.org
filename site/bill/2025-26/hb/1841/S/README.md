## Section 1
The legislature makes the following findings:

1. A program that provides affordable financing for the purchase of original works of art by Washington state artists will stimulate the arts, small businesses, Washington artists, the creative economy, and encourage art ownership;

2. The arts contribute significantly to the economic vitality and cultural richness of Washington state;

3. Access to original works of art enhance the quality of life for individuals, artists, businesses, and communities; and

4. Tasmania's art purchase program provides the basis and guide for Washington state's own your own art program. Since 2009, more than 6,700 Tasmanian artworks worth a combined value of $22,000,000 have been purchased through the program.

## Section 2
The purpose of the own your own art purchase program is to provide interest-free loans to eligible individuals for the purchase of original works of art by Washington state artists from participating arts businesses. This will:

1. Support Washington state artists by facilitating the purchase of their artwork and increasing their income and visibility;

2. Stimulate the arts economy by encouraging art buying, which in turn supports participating art businesses including, but not limited to, galleries and studios, and by contributing to the overall economic health of the arts and creative economy sectors in the state;

3. Increase art ownership by making art more accessible through interest-free loans which can encourage individuals to invest in original artwork, enriching their homes and lives while supporting the arts community;

4. Promote arts and culture by making art more accessible to a wider range of people which will increase appreciation for and engagement with the arts within the state; and

5. Create a win-win situation by connecting art buyers with Washington state artists, fostering a thriving arts ecosystem, and enriching the cultural landscape of the state.
