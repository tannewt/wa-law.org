<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Local governments across Washington employ hundreds of public attorneys in-house yet continue to spend millions of taxpayer dollars annually on private law firms and vendors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In King county alone, between 2000 and 2025, over $56,000,000 was paid to more than 600 private law firms, approximately 78 percent of all outside counsel expenditures, creating structural conflicts that prevent residents from obtaining conflict-free legal representation against those same public entities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This practice undermines public trust, limits access to justice, and diverts funds from essential services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature, therefore, declares that legal services for public agencies are a public function that must be performed by public counsel, not private vendors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of this act to restore transparency, protect taxpayer funds, and ensure that the private legal marketplace remains free to serve the public without government monopolization.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>

</li>
<li>
<p>No portion of any payment made under the interlocal agreement may be used to compensate any private attorney or law firm.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Any payment of public funds by a local public entity to outside counsel, directly or indirectly, is void and constitutes an unauthorized expenditure under RCW 43.09.210.</p>

<p>An officer or employee of a local public entity who authorizes or approves such payments is personally liable for restitution of payment amounts to the public treasury.</p>

<h2 id="section-8">Section 8 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-8">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A local public entity may petition the attorney general for temporary authorization to retain outside counsel. The attorney general may grant a temporary authorization only if the local public entity demonstrates that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>No public counsel is available; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delay would cause substantial and immediate harm to public health or safety.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the attorney general grants the temporary authorization, the attorney general must issue a written, time-limited certification specifying the scope of authorized legal representation.</p>
