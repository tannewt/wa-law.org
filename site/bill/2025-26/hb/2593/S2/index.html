<p>If a school district has 2,000 or more average annual full-time equivalent students, the general fund year ending balance threshold is six percent of its prior year's state apportionment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a school district has fewer than 2,000 average annual full-time equivalent students, the general fund year ending balance threshold is no less than eight percent of its prior year's state apportionment.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Specify whether a school district has failed to meet the applicable fund balance threshold calculated under this section in the school district's financial health indicators.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction may adopt rules to implement this section and section 2 of this act.</p>
