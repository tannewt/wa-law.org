<p>By the 2030-31 school year and each fiscal year thereafter, each school district board of directors shall include a restriction for minimum fund balance within their general fund.

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>For school districts with 2,000 average annual full-time equivalent students or greater, the fund balance must be no less than six percent and no more than 12 percent of their prior year's state apportionment.</p>

<p>For school districts with an enrollment of fewer than 2,000 average annual full-time equivalent students, the fund balance must be no less than eight percent and no more than 34 percent of their prior year's state apportionment.</p>

<li>
<p>To address costs associated with unanticipated actual changes in annual average full-time equivalent enrollment that exceed 2.5 percent from the prior school year;</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>A school district may not be approved to spend below the minimum fund balance two years in a row, except for emergencies to or as necessary for the preservation of life, health, and safety.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction must include whether a school district has failed to replenish its minimum fund balance in the school district's financial health indicators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction must require a school district who has failed to replenish its minimum fund balance in accordance with the approved plan to redirect apportionment funding monthly, in 12 equal installments totaling the amount necessary to restore the minimum restricted fund balance calculated in subsection (2) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction shall adopt rules to implement this section and section 2 of this act.</p>
</li>
