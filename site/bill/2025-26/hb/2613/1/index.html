<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The safety and integrity of compounded medications are paramount to the health and well-being of residents of Washington;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The federal food and drug administration sets internationally recognized standards for drug approval and regulatory oversight; however, there have been increasing attempts by unscrupulous actors to circumvent these regulations, undermining public trust and patient safety;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foreign entities, including those from countries such as China, have exploited regulatory gaps to introduce inferior or contaminated active pharmaceutical ingredients into the supply chain for medications intended for compounding;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recent cases, such as those involving medications for weight loss, have demonstrated that high demand can lead to the proliferation of use of illicit, substandard, and potentially harmful active pharmaceutical ingredients, jeopardizing patient health and safety;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the food and drug administration bears responsibility for enforcing federal laws to protect citizens from misbranded and adulterated pharmaceutical ingredients, enforcement has proven insufficient to curtail the influx of these substances; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even after the federal food and drug administration took some action to curb imports of active pharmaceutical ingredients for weight loss medications from entities that are not compliant with current good manufacturing practice requirements, patients in our state remain at risk of receiving compounded medications containing active pharmaceutical ingredients produced by entities that the food and drug administration found to not be compliant with those requirements, including active pharmaceutical ingredients imported into the United States before the food and drug administration took action.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that it is necessary for the state to take action to protect its residents by ensuring that all active pharmaceutical ingredients used in compounding are sourced from reputable, registered, and inspected establishments, and that only pharmaceutical-grade, safe, and pure ingredients are utilized in medications for weight loss.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is unlawful for any person or entity to engage in the sale, transfer, or distribution of a drug compounded under section 503A of the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 353a, unless the compounder of the drug:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Uses bulk drug substances that:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Comply with the standards of an applicable United States pharmacopoeia or national formulary monograph, if a monograph exists, and the United States pharmacopoeia chapter on pharmacy compounding;</p>
</li>

<p>If a monograph described in (a)(i) of this subsection (1) does not exist, are drug substances that are components of drugs approved by the federal food and drug administration; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a monograph described in (a)(i) of this subsection (1) does not exist and the drug substance is not a component of a drug approved by the federal food and drug administration, appear on the list developed by the federal food and drug administration pursuant to section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(III) of the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act, 21 U.S.C.

</li>
<li>
<p>Conducts and documents quality control testing of the bulk drug substance prior to its use in a compounded drug to confirm:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The identity and content of the bulk drug substance; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That impurities present are identified, characterized, quantified, and justified given the product and its intended use;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
