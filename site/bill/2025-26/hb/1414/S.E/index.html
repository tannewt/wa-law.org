<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the state, in partnership with employers and the public school system, has developed and invested in career and technical education programs for high school students. These programs have been developed and expanded with the intent of providing 16 and 17 year old students with hands-on work experience, coupled with education and training to work in various industries throughout our state. Many of these programs are designed to allow students to begin working in the field during or upon completion of the program; however, some state agencies have enacted rules that place age restrictions on when a student can start a program, test for a license or certification, or work in a profession for which they have been issued a certification or license. These restrictions are not required by federal law, are inconsistent with many other state laws, and are barriers to 16 and 17 year old students being able to begin coursework, or work in a profession following completion of required education, training, or certification or licensure.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to direct the office of the superintendent of public instruction to, through an expanded statewide career and technical education task force, to review existing laws, rules, and state agencies' policies, and develop recommendations for changes to such laws, rules, and policies to improve access to career opportunities for 16 and 17 year old students who are participating in or who have completed preparatory secondary career and technical education programs.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>(1) The statewide career and technical education task force is established in the office of the superintendent of public instruction. The members of the task force are as follows:</p>
