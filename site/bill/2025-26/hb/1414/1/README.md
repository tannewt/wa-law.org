## Section 1
The legislature finds that the state, in partnership with employers and the public school system, has developed and invested in career and technical education programs for high school students. These programs have been developed and expanded with the intent of providing 16 and 17 year old students with hands-on work experience, coupled with education and training to work in various industries throughout our state. Many of these programs are designed to allow students to begin working in the field during or upon completion of the program; however, some state agencies have enacted rules that place age restrictions on when a student can start a program, test for a license or certification, or work in a profession for which they have been issued a certification or license. These restrictions are not required by federal law, are inconsistent with many other state laws, and are barriers to 16 and 17 year old students being able to begin coursework, or work in a profession following completion of required education, training, or certification or licensure.

Therefore, the legislature intends to direct the office of the superintendent of public instruction to convene a work group to review existing laws, rules, and state agencies' policies, and develop recommendations for changes to such laws, rules, and policies to improve access to career opportunities for 16 and 17 year old students who are participating in or who have completed preparatory secondary career and technical education programs.

## Section 2
1. The office of the superintendent of public instruction, in consultation with the department of labor and industries, shall convene a work group for the purposes of assessing laws, rules, and policies affecting the learning objectives, learning experience, worksite safety, certification, and employment of 16 and 17 year old students who are participating in or who have completed a preparatory secondary career and technical education program. The work group shall provide recommendations on changes to relevant laws, rules, and policies necessary to improve students' access to sustained interactions with industry and community professionals and provide firsthand engagement with the tasks required for the various career fields, while also maintaining appropriate protections for the safety and welfare of minors.

2. In developing the recommendations required by this section, the work group shall:

    a. Identify barriers preventing the training, certification, or employment of minors who are participating in or who have completed a preparatory secondary career and technical education program;

    b. Assess categories of work from which the department of labor and industries has prohibited minors from engaging, but where minors are receiving or have received training through preparatory secondary career and technical education programs;

    c. Assess categories of work from which the department of labor and industries has prohibited minors from engaging, but where minors have received professional licenses or certifications from a state agency or other regulatory authority;

    d. Examine agency rules imposing age restrictions on when a minor can start training, test for or receive a license or certification, or work in a profession for which the minor is participating in or has completed a preparatory secondary career and technical education program;

    e. Assess other agency restrictions on the working hours and schedules of minors who are participating in or who have completed a preparatory secondary career and technical education program; and

    f. Assess the requirements and procedures for school districts to receive approval to deliver career and technical education under RCW 28A.700.010, including whether said requirements or procedures account for relevant age restrictions imposed by agencies or regulatory entities for training, certification, and employment.

3. To the extent practicable, the following entities, groups, and interests must be represented in the work group:

    a. The office of the superintendent of public instruction;

    b. The department of labor and industries;

    c. An association that provides support and leadership to educators in career and technical education programs;

    d. Representatives of school district career and technical education directors, worksite learning coordinators, and career and technical education teachers;

    e. State board for community and technical colleges;

    f. Career connect Washington and the career connected learning cross-agency work group established under RCW 28C.30.030;

    g. The workforce training and education coordinating board;

    h. A state association of skill centers;

        i. Representatives of interested businesses and employer associations and organizations;

    j. Representatives of interested labor organizations in relevant trades; and

    k. Representatives of other interested entities, groups, and interests identified by the office of the superintendent of public instruction.

4. The office of the superintendent of public instruction, the department of labor and industries, and other affected agencies may initiate changes to agency rules and practices based on recommendations of the work group prior to the issuance of the required reports and any related legislative action, provided that any such changes comply with federal and state law.

5. The work group shall submit to the appropriate committees of the legislature, in accordance with RCW 43.01.036, an initial report with recommendations by December 1, 2025, and a final report with recommendations by October 1, 2026. The recommendations may include proposals to modify state laws and agency rules and practices. The reports must include a summary of any changes to agency rules, policies, and practices initiated or completed as a result of the work group's findings and recommendations.

6. This section expires August 1, 2027.
