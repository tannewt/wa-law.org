<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the state, in partnership with employers and the public school system, has developed and invested in career and technical education programs for high school students. These programs have been developed and expanded with the intent of providing 16 and 17 year old students with hands-on work experience, coupled with education and training to work in various industries throughout our state. Many of these programs are designed to allow students to begin working in the field during or upon completion of the program; however, some state agencies have enacted rules that place age restrictions on when a student can start a program, test for a license or certification, or work in a profession for which they have been issued a certification or license. These restrictions are not required by federal law, are inconsistent with many other state laws, and are barriers to 16 and 17 year old students being able to begin coursework, or work in a profession following completion of required education, training, or certification or licensure.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to direct the office of the superintendent of public instruction to convene a work group to review existing laws, rules, and state agencies' policies, and develop recommendations for changes to such laws, rules, and policies to improve access to career opportunities for 16 and 17 year old students who are participating in or who have completed preparatory secondary career and technical education programs.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction, in consultation with the department of labor and industries, shall convene a work group for the purposes of assessing laws, rules, and policies affecting the learning objectives, learning experience, worksite safety, certification, and employment of 16 and 17 year old students who are participating in or who have completed a preparatory secondary career and technical education program. The work group shall provide recommendations on changes to relevant laws, rules, and policies necessary to improve students' access to sustained interactions with industry and community professionals and provide firsthand engagement with the tasks required for the various career fields, while also maintaining appropriate protections for the safety and welfare of minors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In developing the recommendations required by this section, the work group shall:</p>

<p>Assess categories of work from which the department of labor and industries has prohibited minors from engaging, but where minors have received professional licenses or certifications from a state agency or other regulatory authority;</p>

<p>Assess other agency restrictions on the working hours and schedules of minors who are participating in or who have completed a preparatory secondary career and technical education program; and</p>
