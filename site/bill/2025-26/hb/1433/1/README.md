# HB 1433 - Psychedelic substances

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1433.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. Psychedelic substances have a low-risk profile when administered in a context of supported adult use, in a controlled environment, and under the supervision of a trained facilitator;

    b. Many individuals report having profound experiences after taking psychedelic substances creating lasting impressions and inspiring positive change in their lives;

    c. Results from clinical trials reveal therapeutic administration of psychedelic substances to be a promising practice for the treatment of conditions such as substance use disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, treatment-resistant depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and other serious maladies, with a potential effect size many times larger than mainstream pharmaceutical and clinical interventions, obtained with fewer side effects, and much smaller long-term costs. These promising results combined with the risk profile have led both Oregon and Colorado to legalize regulated psychedelic substance services for adults 21 years and older by ballot initiative;

    d. Based on informed speculation, the benefits of therapeutic administration of psychedelic substances are likely to be particularly great when paired with clinical services of a trained therapist who can assist a person in preparing for, and integrating their experience with, psychedelic substances; and

    e. Despite a recent proliferation of studies, the federal government's classification of psychedelic substances as Schedule I controlled substances has stymied the creation of high quality large-scale research studies into their risks and benefits of psychedelic substances, to everyone's detriment.

2. The legislature enacts this act for a threefold purpose:

    a. To provide adults in Washington with a regulated, safe means of accessing psychedelic substances to be overseen by the department of health using fully tested substances administered by licensed professionals;

    b. To provide a safe harbor for health professionals interested in applying their clinical skills and new training to help clients maximize the therapeutic benefit from safe use of psychedelic substances while receiving protection from adverse licensure action within Washington state based on the federal prohibitions; and

    c. To advance knowledge about the risks and benefits of the use of psychedelic substances by facilitating research opportunities in the state of Washington using clinical trials and by analysis of anonymized aggregate data that may not be used to identify an individual person without the person's consent.

## Section 2
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. Equity, access, and inclusion are important values to consider for participation in the regulated psychedelic substance system and participation as clients when the system is established;

    b. There is a special need for the potential benefits from therapeutic use of psychedelic substances among historically disadvantaged communities, economically disadvantaged communities, justice involved communities, and communities that have been disproportionately impacted by the war against drugs;

    c. Experience with legalization in Oregon and Colorado has shown that the highest barrier to participation in the psychedelic substance system is high cost, engendered in part by the unavailability of insurance coverage and the high cost of regulatory operations and regulatory compliance in this new industry;

    d. It is not possible to effectively address equity, access, and inclusion without addressing cost of services;

    e. Consciousness of cost is not incompatible with prudent regard for the safety of psychedelic substance clients and the public; and

    f. While well-designed regulations enhance safety and consumer confidence and promote reasonable and prudent precautions against diversion of psychedelic substances, overbearing regulation, however well-meaning, increases costs for licensees and clients.

2. Therefore, the legislature directs the department of health and the liquor and cannabis board to consider the cost and complexity of regulatory compliance when adopting regulations under this act, and to enact rules that maximize flexibility and lower costs for licensees and streamline the experience for clients as much as possible, considering the comparatively small street value and lack of toxicity of psychedelic substances, and maintaining due regard for client safety.

## Section 3
1. Regulatory duties under this act are divided between:

    a. The department of health, which must oversee the licensure of facilitators, clinical facilitators, and service centers, and develop rules relating to preparation, administration, and integration sessions, including permissible locations for administration sessions; and

    b. The liquor and cannabis board, which must oversee the licensure of manufacturers and laboratories and develop regulations related to testing, tracking, packaging, and labeling of psychedelic substances.

2. The department of health and the liquor and cannabis board must collaborate closely in order to execute their duties under this act in a consistent and cost-effective manner, and may enter memoranda of understanding or joint operating or enforcement agreements when doing so would decrease the cost of regulation and lessen the burden of regulatory compliance for licensees.

## Section 4
This act may be known and cited as the psychedelic substances act.

## Section 5
This chapter may not be construed:

1. To require a government medical assistance program or private health insurer to reimburse a person for costs associated with the administration of psychedelic substances;

2. To prohibit a recipient of a federal grant or an applicant for a federal grant from prohibiting the manufacture, delivery, possession, or use of psychedelic substances to the extent necessary to satisfy federal requirements for the grant;

3. To prohibit a party to a federal contract or a person applying to be a party to a federal contract from prohibiting the manufacture, delivery, possession, or use of psychedelic substances to the extent necessary to comply with the terms and conditions of the contract or to satisfy federal requirements for the contract; or

4. To obstruct the enforcement of a federal law.
