# HB 2599 - Therapy and psychotherapy

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2599.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed to provide mental and behavioral health services to Washington residents, including vulnerable populations such as minors and individuals in crisis. These artificial intelligence systems pose significant risks when deployed without appropriate human oversight, clinical validation, and regulatory safeguards.

Artificial intelligence systems cannot replicate the clinical judgment, ethical obligations, and therapeutic relationship essential to licensed mental health practice. Consumers are often unaware when interacting with artificial intelligence rather than licensed professionals. Artificial intelligence companies have used protected professional titles and clinical terminology, misleading consumers about system qualifications and capabilities. Minors and vulnerable populations are particularly susceptible to harm from unregulated artificial intelligence mental health tools.

The legislature intends to prohibit artificial intelligence systems from independently providing mental or behavioral health services while preserving appropriate use of artificial intelligence as an assistive tool by licensed professionals under direct supervision.

## Section 2
1. A licensed professional may not use artificial intelligence in such a way that allows it to do any of the following:

    a. Make independent therapeutic decisions;

    b. Directly interact with clients in any form of therapeutic communication;

    c. Generate therapeutic recommendations or treatment plans without review and approval by the licensed professional; or

    d. Detect emotions or mental states of clients.

2. A licensed professional may not use artificial intelligence to assist in providing supplementary support in therapy or psychotherapy where the client's therapeutic session is recorded or transcribed unless:

    a. The patient or the patient's legally authorized representative is informed in writing of the following: (i) That artificial intelligence will be used; and (ii) the specific purpose of the artificial intelligence tool or system that will be used; and

    b. The patient or the patient's legally authorized representative provides consent to the permitted use of artificial intelligence.
