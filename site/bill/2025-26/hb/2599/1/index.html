<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed to provide mental and behavioral health services to Washington residents, including vulnerable populations such as minors and individuals in crisis. These artificial intelligence systems pose significant risks when deployed without appropriate human oversight, clinical validation, and regulatory safeguards.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence systems cannot replicate the clinical judgment, ethical obligations, and therapeutic relationship essential to licensed mental health practice. Consumers are often unaware when interacting with artificial intelligence rather than licensed professionals. Artificial intelligence companies have used protected professional titles and clinical terminology, misleading consumers about system qualifications and capabilities. Minors and vulnerable populations are particularly susceptible to harm from unregulated artificial intelligence mental health tools.</p>
<p>The legislature intends to prohibit artificial intelligence systems from independently providing mental or behavioral health services while preserving appropriate use of artificial intelligence as an assistive tool by licensed professionals under direct supervision.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
