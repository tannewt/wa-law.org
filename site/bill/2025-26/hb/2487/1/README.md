# HB 2487 - Insurer taxes

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2487.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that unintended tax loopholes adversely impact the state budget and reduce amounts available to fund schools and other essential services.

2. The legislature further finds that in 1935 the legislature enacted as RCW 82.04.320 a business and occupation tax exemption that applied to "any person in respect to insurance business upon which a tax based on gross premiums is paid to the state." The Washington supreme court, in Armstrong v. State, 61 Wn.2d 116 (1962), unanimously held that the purpose of the exemption was to prevent insurance businesses from paying two state taxes on the same income, not to create a means for noninsurers to avoid paying any state tax.

3. In 2024, in Envolve Pharmacy Solutions, Inc. v. Department of Revenue, 4 Wn.3d 142 (2024), a majority of the Washington supreme court broadly construed the exemption to permit pharmacy benefit managers, and likely other businesses that do not earn premium income and do not pay a premium tax, to avoid paying business and occupation tax on amounts they receive from insurance businesses that do pay premium tax, contrary to the purpose of the exemption as construed in Armstrong. The court relied in large part on the legislature's use of passive voice, rather than active voice, when it enacted the exemption in 1935. If left unchecked, the decision in Envolve Pharmacy Solutions, Inc. would create a large and unintended drain on the state's budget.

4. Therefore, the legislature finds that it is necessary to restore parity between the language used in RCW 82.04.320 and the intended purpose of that business and occupation tax exemption by restating the exemption in active voice. To streamline the administration of the tax as applied to insurers, the legislature intends to consolidate the similar tax exemptions in RCW 82.04.320 and 82.04.322 into a single exemption.

5. The legislature further finds that on October 2, 2019, the department of revenue issued public guidance in the form of an interim guidance statement that explained, in part, that a person claiming the exemptions in RCW 82.04.320 must show proof that it paid premium tax to the state with respect to the gross income it claims as exempt from business and occupation tax. The supreme court's decision in Envolve Pharmacy Solutions, Inc. forced the department to rescind that guidance.

6. The legislature intends for this act to apply both prospectively and retroactively to tax periods beginning on or after October 2, 2019, the date that the department of revenue issued the interim guidance statement. By applying the act retroactively to October 2, 2019, the legislature intends to treat businesses that did not follow the department's guidance equally to those businesses that followed the guidance. The legislature intends that enforcement actions by the department of revenue against persons governed by the exemption under RCW 82.04.322 before the effective date of this section remain valid.

## Section 2
1.

This chapter does not apply to gross premiums received by an insurer upon which the same insurer paid insurance premium taxes to the state pursuant to chapter 48.14 or 48.15 RCW.

2. The exemption in subsection (1) of this section also applies to gross premiums received by an insurer that is exempt from premium taxes under RCW 48.14.0201(6).

3. For purposes of this section, for periods preceding May 12, 2021, eligible captive insurers as defined in RCW 48.201.020 are deemed, in respect to their insurance business, to have paid a tax under RCW 48.14.020 or 48.201.040 on their receipt of premiums .

4. Eligible captive insurers affiliated with a public institution of higher education that are exempt from paying a premium tax under RCW 48.201.040 are exempt from the tax imposed by this chapter in respect to their insurance business. For purposes of this subsection (4), the definitions in RCW 48.201.020 apply.

5. For the purposes of this section:

    a. "Insurance business" means activity performed by an insurer as defined in RCW 48.01.050 upon which it earns or receives premiums.

    b. "Insurer" means a person that lawfully transacts insurance business in this state, including an insurance broker who pays premium taxes pursuant to chapter 48.14 or 48.15 RCW on behalf of insurance businesses.

    c. "Premium" has the same meaning as in RCW 48.18.170.

## Section 3
## Section 4
Section 2 of this act applies both prospectively and retroactively to October 2, 2019.

## Section 5
This act does not affect any final judgment, no longer subject to appeal, entered by a court of competent jurisdiction before the effective date of section 2 of this act.
