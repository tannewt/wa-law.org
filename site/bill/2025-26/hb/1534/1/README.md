The following penalties apply to violations of sections 7 through 17 of this act:

1. [Empty]

    a. In addition to, or in lieu of, any other civil or criminal remedy provided by law, a retailer, distributor, wholesaler, or importer, who sells or offers for sale a vapor product containing nicotine for retail sale in this state or to a consumer in this state that is not included in the directory is subject to a civil penalty of $500 for each individual vapor product containing nicotine offered for sale in violation of sections 7 through 17 of this act.

    b. For a second violation of (a) of this subsection within a 12-month period, the civil penalty must be at least $750 but not more than $1,000 per vapor product containing nicotine and the licensee's license must be suspended for 30 days.

    c. For a third violation of (a) of this subsection within a 12-month period, the civil penalty must be at least $1,000 but not more than $1,500 per vapor product containing nicotine and the licensee's license must be revoked;

2. A manufacturer whose vapor products containing nicotine are not listed in the directory and who causes the vapor products containing nicotine that are not listed to be sold for retail sale in this state, whether directly or through an importer, distributor, wholesaler, retailer, or similar intermediary or intermediaries, is subject to a civil penalty of $10,000 for each individual vapor product offered for sale in violation of this section. In addition, any manufacturer that falsely represents any information required by a certification form is guilty of a class C misdemeanor for each false representation;

3. In an action under this section, the state is entitled to recover costs, including the costs of investigation, expert witness fees, and reasonable attorneys' fees;

4. Vapor products containing nicotine offered for sale in violation of sections 7 through 17 of this act are considered contraband and may be seized and disposed of or destroyed by an enforcement officer of the board. The cost of seizure and disposal or destruction must be borne by the person from whom the vapor products are confiscated, and not by the board;

5. The board may seek recovery of the penalty in a civil action in superior court;

6. The board may seek an injunction in superior court to restrain a threatened or actual violation of this section and to compel compliance with this section; and

7. A second or subsequent violation of sections 7 through 17 of this act is not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business and is an unfair and deceptive act or practice and an unfair method of competition in the conduct of trade or commerce in violation of RCW 19.86.020. Standing to bring an action to enforce RCW 19.86.020 for violation of this section lies solely with the attorney general. Remedies provided by chapter 19.86 RCW are cumulative and not exclusive.

## Section 14
Each retailer, distributor, and wholesaler that sells or distributes vapor products containing nicotine in this state are subject to at least two unannounced compliance checks annually for purposes of enforcing this section. Unannounced follow-up compliance checks of all noncompliant retailers, distributors, and wholesalers must be conducted within 30 days after any violation of sections 7 through 17 of this act. The board must publish the results of all compliance checks at least annually and make the results available to the public on request. The requirements of this section do not apply to an Indian tribal organization, Indian retailer, or Indian distributor, as those terms are defined in RCW 82.25.105.

## Section 15
1. Any nonresident or foreign manufacturer that has not registered to do business in the state as a foreign corporation or business entity must, as a condition precedent to having its vapor products containing nicotine included or retained in the directory, appoint and continually engage without interruption the services of an agent in this state to act as agent for the service of process on whom all process, and any action or proceeding against it concerning or arising out of the enforcement of sections 7 through 17 of this act, may be served in any manner authorized by law. The service must constitute legal and valid service of process on the manufacturer. The manufacturer must provide the name, address, phone number, and proof of the appointment and availability of the agent to the satisfaction of the board.

2. The manufacturer must provide notice to the board 30 days before termination of the authority of an agent and must further provide proof to the satisfaction of the board of the appointment of a new agent no fewer than five days before the termination of an existing agent appointment. If an agent terminates an agency appointment, the manufacturer must notify the board of the termination within five days and include proof to the satisfaction of the board of the appointment of a new agent.

3. Any manufacturer whose vapor products containing nicotine are sold in this state, who has not appointed and engaged an agent as required in this section, must be deemed to have appointed the secretary of state as the agent and may be proceeded against in courts of this state by service of process upon the secretary of state. However, the appointment of the secretary of state as agent does not satisfy the condition precedent for having the vapor products containing nicotine of the manufacturer included or retained in the directory.

## Section 16
1. Any nonresident or foreign manufacturer that has not registered to do business in the state as a foreign corporation or business entity must, as a condition precedent to having its name or its vapor products containing nicotine listed and retained in the directory, submit to the board a surety bond or other cash security payable to the state of Washington in the amount of $25,000. The bond must be posted by a corporate surety located within the United States.

2. The bond under subsection (1) of this section must be conditioned on the performance by the manufacturer of all requirements and obligations imposed by this section. A surety on a manufacturer's bond is liable up to the amount of the bond and the state may execute on the surety bond for the payment of fines and penalties imposed on the manufacturer under section 13 of this act and for the costs of seizure and destruction of products sold in violation of sections 7 through 17 of this act. If the state executes on the surety bond, it may require the manufacturer to provide an additional bond as a condition precedent for retaining the manufacturer or its vapor products containing nicotine in the directory.

3. A surety on a bond furnished by a manufacturer as provided in this section must be released and discharged from liability to the state accruing on the bond after 60 days from the date upon which the surety has filed with the board a written request to be released and discharged. This subsection does not operate to relieve, release, or discharge the surety from liability already accrued or that accrues before the expiration of the 60-day period. The board must, upon receiving a request under this subsection, notify the manufacturer who furnished the bond. The board must remove the manufacturer and its vapor products containing nicotine from the directory unless the manufacturer files a new bond with the board before the expiration of the 60-day period, with the surety approved by and acceptable to the board.

## Section 17
1. Nicotine analogue means a substance:
