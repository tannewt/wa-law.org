<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the history, economy, culture, and future of Washington state are inextricably linked to a vibrant and healthy visitor economy. In order to develop, manage, and promote statewide tourism as part of an existing comprehensive effort to market Washington as a premier travel destination, the legislature declares:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>That it is vital to the continued economic well-being and general welfare of the citizens of this state that the tourism industry be supported by:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Enabling the tourism industry to help themselves through an organized, year-around, statewide assessment program designed to support fair, efficient, and sustained promotion and management of Washington as a visitor destination; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhancing tourism market opportunities and strengthening the industry's long-term competitiveness by increasing travel to and within Washington across leisure, business, and international markets;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>That tourism-dependent businesses, including lodging, food and beverage, attractions, recreation, cultural institutions, and retail, operate in a regulatory and funding environment that limits marketing autonomy, creates fragmented promotion efforts, and contributes to Washington's declining market share in a highly competitive global visitor economy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That it is in the overriding public interest to clearly express support for the tourism sector and its coordinated and orderly growth; to give adequate recognition and operational resources to tourism as a vital component of Washington's export economy and value-added service sector; and to promote, develop, and manage tourism as an essential statewide industry in order to:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Enhance the reputation and image of Washington as a travel destination;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase visitor spending from domestic and international markets; strategically positioning the destination and optimizing the benefits of visitation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protect the public interest by providing destination development that benefits communities, small businesses, tribes, and other stakeholders and educating travelers about responsible and sustainable visitation to communities and public and tribal lands;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expand tourism-driven economic opportunities, development resources, and community benefits in urban and rural regions alike;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support and engage in programs and partnerships that benefit the development, management, marketing, and sustainability of tourism across Washington; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="i" start="6">
<li>
<p>Expand the communication, cooperation, and partnership between the public and private sectors to more effectively meet the needs of both; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That a stable and predictable funding mechanism, developed and governed by the industry through a self-supported assessment, can generate substantial economic returns for the state and empower local businesses, destinations, and communities to compete on a level playing field with neighboring states and national leaders such as California, Oregon, and British Columbia.</p>
</li>
</ol>
