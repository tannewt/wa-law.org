<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes that fostering technological innovation is essential for Washington state's economic growth and long-term competitiveness. By investing in emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, the state can access new sources of revenue, create high paying jobs, and position itself as a national leader in cutting-edge industries. Artificial intelligence-driven solutions have the potential to address critical statewide challenges, such as predicting and managing wildfires, improving the effectiveness of cybersecurity, and improving public health responses. Promoting the development of these technologies will not only strengthen Washington's economy, but also enhance public safety and government efficiency.</p>

By encouraging innovation, this act will drive economic expansion, advance broad public benefits, attract private investment, ensure that Washington remains at the forefront of technological progress, and equip the state with cutting-edge tools to address its most pressing challenges.</p>
