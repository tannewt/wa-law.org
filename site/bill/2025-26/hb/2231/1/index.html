<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The prosecuting attorney may file a special allegation of attempting to conceal identity in every felony criminal case, when sufficient admissible evidence exists, to show that the defendant:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Committed the offense, in whole or in part, on the premises of a postsecondary institution; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wore a mask, hood, or other article of clothing or device that covered, hid, or concealed any portion of the defendant's face, with the intent to prevent identification during the commission of the offense or in immediate flight therefrom.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a criminal case in which there has been a special allegation, the state shall prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the offense under the circumstances described in subsection (1) of this section. The court shall make a finding of fact of whether or not the circumstances described in subsection (1) of this section occurred, or if a jury trial is had, the jury shall, if it finds the defendant guilty, also find a special verdict as to whether or not the circumstances described in subsection (1) of this section occurred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;postsecondary institution&quot; means any public or private institution of higher education, public or private vocational school, degree-granting institution as defined in RCW 28B.85.010, or school as defined in RCW 18.16.020, located in the state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The provisions of this section apply to the standard sentence ranges determined by RCW 9.94A.510 or 9.94A.517.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For persons convicted of the anticipatory offenses of criminal attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy under chapter 9A.28 RCW, the standard sentence range is determined by locating the sentencing grid sentence range defined by the appropriate offender score and the seriousness level of the completed crime, and multiplying the range by 75 percent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following additional times shall be added to the standard sentence range for felony crimes committed after July 23, 1995, if the offender or an accomplice was armed with a firearm as defined in RCW 9.41.010 and the offender is being sentenced for one of the crimes listed in this subsection as eligible for any firearm enhancements based on the classification of the completed felony crime. If the offender is being sentenced for more than one offense, the firearm enhancement or enhancements must be added to the total period of confinement for all offenses, regardless of which underlying offense is subject to a firearm enhancement. If the offender or an accomplice was armed with a firearm as defined in RCW 9.41.010 and the offender is being sentenced for an anticipatory offense under chapter 9A.28 RCW to commit one of the crimes listed in this subsection as eligible for any firearm enhancements, the following additional times shall be added to the standard sentence range determined under subsection (2) of this section based on the felony crime of conviction as classified under RCW 9A.28.020:</p>

<p>If the standard sentence range under this section exceeds the statutory maximum sentence for the offense, the statutory maximum sentence shall be the presumptive sentence unless the offender is a persistent offender.
