<ol>
<li>
<p>A county or a city may use a variety of innovative zoning techniques in areas designated as agricultural lands of long-term commercial significance under RCW 36.70A.170. The innovative zoning techniques should be designed to conserve agricultural lands and encourage the agricultural economy. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, a county or city should encourage nonagricultural uses to be limited to lands with poor soils or otherwise not suitable for agricultural purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Innovative zoning techniques a county or city may consider include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Agricultural zoning, which limits the density of development and restricts or prohibits nonfarm uses of agricultural land and may allow accessory uses, including nonagricultural accessory uses and activities, that support, promote, or sustain agricultural operations and production, as provided in subsection (3) of this section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cluster zoning, which allows new development on one portion of the land, leaving the remainder in agricultural or open space uses;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Large lot zoning, which establishes as a minimum lot size the amount of land necessary to achieve a successful farming practice;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quarter/quarter zoning, which permits one residential dwelling on a one-acre minimum lot for each one-sixteenth of a section of land; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sliding scale zoning, which allows the number of lots for single-family residential purposes with a minimum lot size of one acre to increase inversely as the size of the total acreage increases.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accessory uses allowed under subsection (2)(a) of this section shall comply with the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Accessory uses shall be located, designed, and operated so as to not interfere with, and to support the continuation of, the overall agricultural use of the property and neighboring properties, and shall comply with the requirements of this chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accessory uses may include:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Agricultural accessory uses and activities, including but not limited to the storage, distribution, and marketing of regional agricultural products from one or more producers, agriculturally related experiences, or the production, marketing, and distribution of value-added agricultural products, including support services that facilitate these activities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nonagricultural accessory uses and activities as long as they are consistent with the size, scale, and intensity of the existing agricultural use of the property and the existing buildings on the site. Nonagricultural accessory uses and activities, including new buildings, parking, or supportive uses, shall not be located outside the general area already developed for buildings and residential uses and shall not otherwise convert more than one acre of agricultural land to nonagricultural uses; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solar energy production facilities including agrivoltaic facilities, solar pivot corner facilities as described in RCW 43.21F.100, and other facilities that place solar panels in agricultural lands of long-term commercial significance under RCW 36.70A.170 in a manner that does not meet the description of agrivoltaic facilities or pivot corner facilities in RCW 43.21F.100, but that meets the standards established under (b)(i) or (ii) of this subsection; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Counties and cities have the authority to limit or exclude accessory uses otherwise authorized in this subsection (3) in areas designated as agricultural lands of long-term commercial significance.</p>
</li>

<p>Each county that is required or chooses to plan under RCW 36.70A.040, and each city within such county, shall adopt development regulations on or before September 1, 1991, to assure the conservation of agricultural, forest, and mineral resource lands designated under RCW 36.70A.170. Regulations adopted under this subsection may not prohibit uses legally existing on any parcel prior to their adoption and shall remain in effect until the county or city adopts development regulations pursuant to RCW 36.70A.040. Such regulations shall assure that the use of lands adjacent to agricultural, forest, or mineral resource lands shall not interfere with the continued use, in the accustomed manner and in accordance with best management practices, of these designated lands for the production of food, agricultural products, or timber, or for the extraction of minerals. As of the effective date of this section, agrivoltaic facilities and pivot corner facilities, as described in RCW 43.21F.100, are determined to assure conservation of agricultural lands designated under RCW 36.70A.170 and not to interfere with the continued use, in the accustomed manner and in accordance with best management practices, of designated agricultural resource lands for the production of food and agricultural products. County regulations adopted under this section must be revised to be consistent with this determination on or before July 1, 2029. Any county located to the west of the crest of the Cascade mountains that has both a population of at least four hundred thousand and a border that touches another state, and any city in such county, may adopt development regulations to assure that agriculture, forest, and mineral resource lands adjacent to short line railroads may be developed for freight rail dependent uses.</p>
