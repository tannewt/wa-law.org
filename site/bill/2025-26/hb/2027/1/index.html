<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the lack of housing affordability and related instances of homelessness are issues that affect every community in Washington. The legislature also finds that increased homelessness is overwhelmingly caused by rising rents, which push people living at the margins into homelessness, erode public confidence, and undermine the shared values that have driven our state's prosperity. The legislature further finds that problems caused by rent increases are exacerbated by the associated issue of very low vacancy rates, which make it difficult for people to find a unit even when they have sufficient income or rental assistance to pay market rates. The legislature finds that low housing vacancy rates, the growth in population, and a limited housing supply have created a housing shortage in which existing inventory is priced at a premium. The legislature also finds that although household incomes have grown along with the economy, increases in income for those with moderate and lower incomes have not kept pace with rent and purchase price increases. This problem is especially impacting lower and fixed income households, including people with disabilities, seniors, veterans, and farmworkers.</p>
<p>Indeed, these trends, in combination with other market factors, have created a deficit of housing that is affordable and available, particularly for Washingtonians within the low to middle income range who are increasingly more vulnerable to homelessness. Moreover, the legislature finds that these households have the fewest options available in the private housing market to find and retain a unit. In strong housing markets, builders seek the highest achievable price to offset higher development costs, which means new production does not create more housing that is affordable.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that to meet the housing needs of all Washingtonians over the next 20 years, we need to build more than 500,000 new homes affordable to very and extremely low-income people, those making less than 50 percent of area median income. Furthermore, the legislature finds that having a home is a basic need and fundamental for Washington residents, and that all Washingtonians should be able to afford safe and dependable housing with access to opportunities such as education, employment, transit, and amenities.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that housing that is affordable is an essential part of every community's infrastructure, serving as a platform for individuals and families to stabilize, build their economic futures, and thrive. Housing serves as a platform for better health and creates jobs and attracts investment, making it a prerequisite to economic growth and stronger communities. In addition, the legislature finds that a variety of housing types is needed to provide affordable options for families of all sizes and stages of life. Furthermore, the legislature finds that increasing the supply of permanently affordable housing, getting residents back into housing, and reducing homelessness is a priority of the people of Washington state, and that reducing homelessness lessens the fiscal impact to the state and improves the economic vitality of our businesses.</p>
<p>Moreover, the legislature finds that the private real estate market does not provide adequate housing options affordable for all economic segments, and thus government assistance is needed to offer the full range of affordable housing options.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to increase the supply of housing that is affordable and to stabilize and get people back into housing through permanent, dedicated investment in state housing programs for Washington residents in the low to middle income range.</p>
