</li>
<li>
<p>(a) If a condominium unit is part of a common interest community organized under this chapter and created prior to the effective date of this section, a declarant and any dealer impliedly warrants to a purchaser of the condominium unit that the unit and the common elements in the condominium are suitable for the ordinary uses of real estate of its type and that any improvements made or contracted for by such declarant or dealer will be:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Constructed in accordance with the approved plans, specifications, and applicable building codes in effect at the time of construction; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Constructed in a workmanlike manner. For purposes of this subsection (2)(b)(iii), &quot;workmanlike manner&quot; means the degree of care that a reasonably prudent contractor licensed in the state of Washington would exercise under the same or similar circumstances.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A declarant and any dealer warrants to a purchaser of a condominium unit that may be used for residential use that an existing use, continuation of which is contemplated by the parties, does not violate applicable law at the earlier of the time of conveyance or delivery of possession.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Warranties imposed under this section may be excluded or modified as specified in RCW 64.90.675.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section, improvements made or contracted for by an affiliate of a declarant are made or contracted for by the declarant.</p>

<p>In a proceeding for breach of any of the obligations arising under this section, the purchaser must show that the alleged breach has adversely affected or will adversely affect the performance of that portion of the unit or common elements alleged to be in breach. Nothing in this section limits the ability of a board to bring claims on behalf of two or more unit owners pursuant to RCW 64.90.405(2)(d).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To establish an adverse effect on performance, the purchaser is required to prove that the alleged breach:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Is more than technical;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is significant to a reasonable person; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has caused or will cause physical damage to the unit or common elements; has materially impaired the performance of mechanical, electrical, plumbing, elevator, or similar building equipment; or presents an actual, unreasonable safety risk to the occupants of the condominium.</p>

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proof of breach of any obligation arising under this section is not proof of damages. Damages awarded for a breach of a warranty arising under subsection (2) of this section are the reasonable cost of repairs. However, if it is established that the cost of such repairs is clearly disproportionate to the loss in market value caused by the breach, damages are limited to the loss in market value.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, parties to a dispute arising under this chapter or the governing documents may agree at any time to resolve the dispute by any form of binding or nonbinding alternative dispute resolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An action commenced under RCW 64.90.680 must be arbitrated pursuant to RCW 64.55.100 if:</p>

<li>
<p>A condominium unit is part of a common interest community created on or after the effective date of this section;</p>

<p>(a) Except as otherwise provided in (b) of this subsection, if the declarant, an association, or a party unit owner demands an arbitration by filing such demand with the court not less than thirty and not more than ninety days after filing or service of the complaint, whichever is later, the parties shall participate in a private arbitration hearing. The declarant, the association, and the party unit owner do not have the right to compel arbitration without giving timely notice in compliance with this subsection. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitration hearing shall commence no more than fourteen months from the later of the filing or service of the complaint.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the court shall appoint the arbitrator, who shall be a current or former attorney with experience as an attorney, judge, arbitrator, or mediator in construction defect disputes involving the application of Washington law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon conclusion of the arbitration hearing, the arbitrator shall file the decision and award with the clerk of the superior court, together with proof of service thereof on the parties. Within twenty days after the filing of the decision and award, any aggrieved party may file with the clerk a written notice of appeal and demand for a trial de novo in the superior court on all claims between the appealing party and an adverse party. As used in this section, &quot;adverse party&quot; means the party who either directly asserted or defended claims against the appealing party. The demand shall identify the adverse party or parties and all claims between those parties shall be included in the trial de novo. The right to a trial de novo includes the right to a jury, if demanded. The court shall give priority to the trial date for the trial de novo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the judgment for damages, not including awards of fees and costs, in the trial de novo is not more favorable to the appealing party than the damages awarded by the arbitrator, not including awards of fees and costs, the appealing party shall pay the nonappealing adverse party's costs and fees incurred after the filing of the appeal, including reasonable attorneys' fees so incurred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the judgment for damages, not including awards of fees and costs, in the trial de novo is more favorable to the appealing party than the damages awarded by the arbitrator, not including awards of fees and costs, then the court may award costs and fees, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred after the filing of the request for trial de novo in accordance with applicable law; provided if such a judgment is not more favorable to the appealing party than the most recent offer of judgment, if any, made pursuant to RCW 64.55.160, the court shall not make an award of fees and costs to the appealing party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a party is entitled to an award with respect to the same fees and costs pursuant to this section and RCW 64.55.160, then the party shall only receive an award of fees and costs as provided in and limited by RCW 64.55.160. Any award of fees and costs pursuant to subsections (5) or (6) of this section is subject to review in the event of any appeal thereof otherwise permitted by applicable law or court rule.</p>

<p>In every construction defect action brought against a construction professional, the claimant shall, no later than 45 days before filing an action, serve written notice of claim on the construction professional.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The notice of claim shall state that the claimant asserts a construction defect claim against the construction professional and shall describe the claim in reasonable detail sufficient to determine the general nature of the defect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the claimant is a condominium association created after July 23, 2023, the written notice of claim shall include a written report from a construction defect professional.

<p>If the claimant rejects the offer made by the construction professional pursuant to (b)(i) or (ii) of this subsection to either remedy the construction defect or to compromise and settle the claim by monetary payment, the claimant shall serve written notice of the claimant's rejection on the construction professional. After service of the rejection notice, the claimant may bring an action against the construction professional for the construction defect claim described in the notice of claim. If the construction professional has not received from the claimant, within 30 days after the claimant's receipt of the construction professional's response, either an acceptance or rejection of the offer made pursuant to (b)(i) or (ii) of this subsection, then at anytime thereafter the construction professional may terminate the offer by serving written notice to the claimant.</p>

<p>Any action commenced by a claimant prior to compliance with the requirements of this section shall be subject to dismissal without prejudice, and may not be recommenced until the claimant has complied with the requirements of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section may be construed to prevent a claimant from commencing an action on the construction defect claim described in the notice of claim if the construction professional fails to perform the construction agreed upon, fails to remedy the defect, or fails to perform by the timetable agreed upon pursuant to subsection (3)(a) or (6) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to commencing any action alleging a construction defect, or after the dismissal of any action without prejudice pursuant to subsection (7) of this section, the claimant may amend the notice of claim to include construction defects discovered after the service of the original notice of claim, and must otherwise comply with the requirements of this section for the additional claims. The service of an amended notice of claim shall relate back to the original notice of claim for purposes of tolling statutes of limitations and repose. Claims for defects discovered after the commencement or recommencement of an action may be added to such action only after providing notice to the construction professional of the defect and allowing for response under subsection (3) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the claimant is an association, and notwithstanding any contrary provisions in the association's governing documents, the association's board of director's ability to incur expenses to prepare and serve a notice of claim and any related reports and otherwise comply with the requirements of this chapter shall not be restricted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the subject of the claim under this section is a residence constructed or substantially remodeled on or after the effective date of this section, the court or arbitrator shall assess costs and reasonable attorneys' fees against a claimant or construction professional who refuses to accept an offer to remedy the defect or a compromise by payment and fails to improve its position in the subsequent construction defect action.</p>
