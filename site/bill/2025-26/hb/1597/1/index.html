<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes the vital importance of Washington's agricultural labor force and its contributions to the state's cultural, economic, and social diversity. The legislature also recognizes the economic burden placed on agricultural workers through the enactment of the overtime pay law. Since its inception, the law has had the unintended consequences of reduced hours of employment and a corresponding loss of earned income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2020, in a 5-4 opinion, the Washington supreme court ruled in Martinez-Cuevas v. DeRuyter Bros. Dairy (DeRuyter) that the existing exemption from overtime in agricultural employment was unconstitutional as it applied to employment in the dairy industry. In reaching its conclusion, the court distinguished between regular hours worked in dairy production and the seasonal nature of agricultural crop production. In 2021, the legislature repealed a state law in effect since 1959 that exempted agricultural workers from overtime pay, effectively extending the DeRuyter decision to all production agriculture. With this historic legislation, Washington became among the first states in the nation to impose an overtime pay requirement for agricultural workers working more than 40 hours per week. Recognizing that such a change would be a sizeable shift in practice for all farmers and agricultural workers across the state, the legislature adopted a phased-in approach, but did not address the seasonal needs of Washington agriculture given the time-sensitive nature of growing and harvesting mature field crops and perishable fruits and vegetables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To assess potential impacts to Washington's agricultural workforce, the legislature looks to the state of California that adopted a similar phased-in policy in 2016 that came into full effect in 2019, in which hours of work after 40 hours per week must be paid overtime. In a study conducted by Alexandra E. Hill, assistant professor in the department of agricultural and resource economics at the University of California, Berkeley, she stated: &quot;California's new overtime law for agricultural workers went into effect in 2019. In the two years following this, I find that the law led to decreases in weekly working hours and earnings for California crop workers. These losses are consistent with employers restricting hours to avoid paying the higher overtime rates.&quot; California's experience is now playing out in Washington as evidenced by nearly 300 farm workers coming to the state capitol in January of 2024, demanding that the current policy be changed and that their previous hours of employment be reinstated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agriculture is the second largest driver of Washington's economy and is unique from other types of industry due to pressures on farmers, ranchers, and workers caused by circumstances largely beyond their control. These include the uncertainty of weather, yields, livestock production, national and international shifts in trade policy, and transportation inconsistencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that in 2023, labor expenses per farming operation in Washington were 462 percent higher than the national average and Washington is currently losing on average, two farms per day. The legislature further recognizes that farmers do not control their own prices and cannot simply respond to increased production costs by increasing the prices of their goods. What farmers can do and have done is reduce hours for agricultural workers and limit harvest production due to increased costs directly related to the elimination of the overtime exemption. These economic pressures are also impacting agriculture workers' mental health, and agriculture suicides are nearly 25 percent higher than the overall state rate. From 2020 through 2022, the suicide rate for agricultural workers in Washington state was 21.1 per 100,000 people, compared with 14.9 per 100,000 people for the state's general population.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that it is reasonable to allow agricultural employers limited flexibility to shape work schedules during narrow windows of time to best fit the peaks of labor demand for their crops and commodities and intends to make available limited seasonal exemptions from the payment of overtime wages in furtherance of its goal of ensuring security for agricultural workers and maintaining the viability of Washington's second largest industry.</p>
