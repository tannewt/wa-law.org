The use or sale of software as described in subsection (1) of this section only violates this section if the user or seller knows or should know that the purpose of the software is to circumvent, thwart, interfere with, or evade a security measure, access control system, or other control or measure on a ticket seller's internet website, application, phone system, or similar technology that is used to enforce posted event admission ticket purchasing limits or to maintain the integrity of posted online admission ticket purchasing order rules.
