<ol>
<li>
<p>A person may not:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Use software to circumvent, thwart, interfere with, or evade a security measure, access control system, or other control or measure on a ticket seller's internet website, application, phone system, or similar technology that is used to enforce posted event admission ticket purchasing limits or to maintain the integrity of posted online admission ticket purchasing order rules; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sell software that is advertised for profit with the express purpose to circumvent, thwart, interfere with, or evade a security measure, access control system, or other control or measure on a ticket seller's internet website, application, phone system, or similar technology that is used to enforce posted event admission ticket purchasing limits or to maintain the integrity of posted online admission ticket purchasing order rules.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use or sale of software as described in subsection (1) of this section only violates this section if the user or seller knows or should know that the purpose of the software is to circumvent, thwart, interfere with, or evade a security measure, access control system, or other control or measure on a ticket seller's internet website, application, phone system, or similar technology that is used to enforce posted event admission ticket purchasing limits or to maintain the integrity of posted online admission ticket purchasing order rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person may not knowingly resell or offer to resell an admission ticket that was obtained using software to circumvent, thwart, interfere with, or evade a security measure, access control system, or other control or measure on a ticket seller's internet website, application, phone system, or similar technology that is used to enforce posted event admission ticket purchasing limits or to maintain the integrity of posted online admission ticket purchasing order rules, and was not obtained for the person's own use or the use of their invitees, employees, or agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the conduct described in subsections (1) and (3) of this section and section 12 of this act vitally affects the public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW. Using or selling software to circumvent, thwart, or evade a control or measure, which is used on a ticket seller's internet website, application, phone system, or similar technology to ensure an equitable distribution of tickets, is not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business and is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce and an unfair method of competition for the purposes of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ticket sellers have an affirmative obligation to notify the attorney general of the use of software as described in this section.</p>
