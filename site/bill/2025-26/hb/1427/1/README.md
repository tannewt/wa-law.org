## Section 1
1. Any agreement or contract by the authority to provide behavioral health services as defined under RCW 71.24.025 to persons eligible for benefits under medicaid, Title XIX of the social security act, and to persons not eligible for medicaid must include the following:

    a. Contractual provisions consistent with the intent expressed in RCW 71.24.015 and 71.36.005;

    e. Provisions to require that medically necessary substance use disorder and mental health treatment services be available to clients;

    f. Standards requiring the use of behavioral health service provider reimbursement methods that incentivize improved performance with respect to the client outcomes established in RCW 71.24.435 and 71.36.025, integration of behavioral health and primary care services at the clinical level, and improved care coordination for individuals with complex care needs;

    g. Standards related to the financial integrity of the contracting entity. This subsection does not limit the authority of the authority to take action under a contract upon finding that a contracting entity's financial status jeopardizes the contracting entity's ability to meet its contractual obligations;

    h. Mechanisms for monitoring performance under the contract and remedies for failure to substantially comply with the requirements of the contract including, but not limited to, financial deductions, termination of the contract, receivership, reprocurement of the contract, and injunctive remedies;

    j. Provisions stating that public funds appropriated by the legislature may not be used to promote or deter, encourage, or discourage employees from exercising their rights under Title 29, chapter 7, subchapter II, United States Code or chapter 41.56 RCW.

2. At least six months prior to releasing a medicaid integrated managed care procurement, but no later than January 1, 2025, the authority shall adopt statewide network adequacy standards that are assessed on a regional basis for the behavioral health provider networks maintained by managed care organizations pursuant to subsection (1)(d) of this section. The standards shall require a network that ensures access to appropriate and timely behavioral health services for the enrollees of the managed care organization who live within the regional service area. At a minimum, these standards must address each behavioral health services type covered by the medicaid integrated managed care contract. This includes, but is not limited to: Outpatient, inpatient, and residential levels of care for adults and youth with a mental health disorder; outpatient, inpatient, and residential levels of care for adults and youth with a substance use disorder; crisis and stabilization services; providers of medication for opioid use disorders; specialty care; other facility-based services; and other providers as determined by the authority through this process. The authority shall apply the standards regionally and shall incorporate behavioral health system needs and considerations as follows:

    a. Include a process for an annual review of the network adequacy standards;

    b. Provide for participation from counties and behavioral health providers in both initial development and subsequent updates;

    c. Account for the regional service area's population; prevalence of behavioral health conditions; types of minimum behavioral health services and service capacity offered by providers in the regional service area; number and geographic proximity of providers in the regional service area; an assessment of the needs or gaps in the region; and availability of culturally specific services and providers in the regional service area to address the needs of communities that experience cultural barriers to health care including but not limited to communities of color and the LGBTQ+ community;

    d. Include a structure for monitoring compliance with provider network standards and timely access to the services;

    e. Consider how statewide services, such as residential treatment facilities, are utilized cross-regionally; and

    f. Consider how the standards would impact requirements for behavioral health administrative service organizations.

3. Before releasing a medicaid integrated managed care procurement, the authority shall identify options that minimize provider administrative burden, including the potential to limit the number of managed care organizations that operate in a regional service area.

4. The following factors must be given significant weight in any medicaid integrated managed care procurement process under this section:

    a. Demonstrated commitment and experience in serving low-income populations;

    b. Demonstrated commitment and experience serving persons who have mental illness, substance use disorders, or co-occurring disorders;

    c. Demonstrated commitment to and experience with partnerships with county and municipal criminal justice systems, housing services, and other critical support services necessary to achieve the outcomes established in RCW 71.24.435, 70.320.020, and 71.36.025;

    d. The ability to provide for the crisis service needs of medicaid enrollees, consistent with the degree to which such services are funded;

    e. Recognition that meeting enrollees' physical and behavioral health care needs is a shared responsibility of contracted behavioral health administrative services organizations, managed care organizations, service providers, the state, and communities;

    f. Consideration of past and current performance and participation in other state or federal behavioral health programs as a contractor;

    g. The ability to meet requirements established by the authority;

    h. The extent to which a managed care organization's approach to contracting simplifies billing and contracting burdens for community behavioral health provider agencies, which may include but is not limited to a delegation arrangement with a provider network that leverages local, federal, or philanthropic funding to enhance the effectiveness of medicaid-funded integrated care services and promote medicaid clients' access to a system of services that addresses additional social support services and social determinants of health as defined in RCW 43.20.025;

        i. Demonstrated prior national or in-state experience with a full continuum of behavioral health services that are substantially similar to the behavioral health services covered under the Washington medicaid state plan, including evidence through past and current data on performance, quality, and outcomes;

    j. Demonstrated commitment by managed care organizations to the use of alternative pricing and payment structures between a managed care organization and its behavioral health services providers, including provider networks described in subsection (b) of this section, and between a managed care organization and a behavioral administrative service organization, in any of their agreements or contracts under this section, which may include but are not limited to:

        i. Value-based purchasing efforts consistent with the authority's value-based purchasing strategy, such as capitated payment arrangements, comprehensive population-based payment arrangements, or case rate arrangements; or

        ii. Payment methods that secure a sufficient amount of ready and available capacity for levels of care that require staffing 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, to serve anyone in the regional service area with a demonstrated need for the service at all times, regardless of fluctuating utilization; and

    k. The accessibility of peer services, as demonstrated in the application through a required comprehensive analysis of access to peer services in the managed care organization's network. The analysis must evaluate the availability of certified peer counselors and peer support specialists certified under chapter 18.420 RCW who are:

        i. Adults in recovery from a mental health condition;

        ii. Adults in recovery from a substance use disorder;

        iii. Youth and young adults in recovery from a mental condition;

        iv. Youth and young adults in recovery from a substance use disorder; and

    v. The parent or legal guardian of a youth who is receiving or has received behavioral health services.

5. The authority may use existing cross-system outcome data such as the outcomes and related measures under subsection (4)(c) of this section and chapter 338, Laws of 2013, to determine that the alternative pricing and payment structures referenced in subsection (4)(j) of this section have advanced community behavioral health system outcomes more effectively than a fee-for-service model may have been expected to deliver.

6. [Empty]

    a. The authority shall urge managed care organizations to establish, continue, or expand delegation arrangements with a provider network that exists on July 23, 2023, and that leverages local, federal, or philanthropic funding to enhance the effectiveness of medicaid-funded integrated care services and promote medicaid clients' access to a system of services that addresses additional social support services and social determinants of health as defined in RCW 43.20.025. Such delegation arrangements must meet the requirements of the integrated managed care contract and the national committee for quality assurance accreditation standards.

    b. The authority shall recognize and support, and may not limit or restrict, a delegation arrangement that a managed care organization and a provider network described in (a) of this subsection have agreed upon, provided such arrangement meets the requirements of the integrated managed care contract and the national committee for quality assurance accreditation standards. The authority may periodically review such arrangements for effectiveness according to the requirements of the integrated managed care contract and the national committee for quality assurance accreditation standards.

    c. Managed care organizations and the authority may evaluate whether to establish or support future delegation arrangements with any additional provider networks that may be created after July 23, 2023, based on the requirements of the integrated managed care contract and the national committee for quality assurance accreditation standards.

7. The authority shall expand the types of behavioral health crisis services that can be funded with medicaid to the maximum extent allowable under federal law, including seeking approval from the centers for medicare and medicaid services for amendments to the medicaid state plan or medicaid state directed payments that support the 24 hours per day, 365 days per year capacity of the crisis delivery system when necessary to achieve this expansion.

8. The authority shall, in consultation with managed care organizations, review reports and recommendations of the involuntary treatment act work group established pursuant to section 103, chapter 302, Laws of 2020 and develop a plan for adding contract provisions that increase managed care organizations' accountability when their enrollees require long-term involuntary inpatient behavioral health treatment and shall explore opportunities to maximize medicaid funding as appropriate.

9. In recognition of the value of community input and consistent with past procurement practices, the authority shall include county and behavioral health provider representatives in the development of any medicaid integrated managed care procurement process. This shall include, at a minimum, two representatives identified by the association of county human services and two representatives identified by the Washington council for behavioral health to participate in the review and development of procurement documents.

10. For purposes of purchasing behavioral health services and medical care services for persons eligible for benefits under medicaid, Title XIX of the social security act and for persons not eligible for medicaid, the authority must use regional service areas. The regional service areas must be established by the authority as provided in RCW 74.09.870.

11. Consideration must be given to using multiple-biennia contracting periods.

12. Each behavioral health administrative services organization operating pursuant to a contract issued under this section shall serve clients within its regional service area who meet the authority's eligibility criteria for mental health and substance use disorder services within available resources.

## Section 2
1. The authority shall contract with one or more external entities to expand access to peer support services.

2. Beginning October 1, 2025, the entity or entities shall:

    a. Provide technical assistance to support primary care clinics, urgent care clinics, and hospitals to integrate certified peer support specialists into their clinical care models and bill health insurance carriers for those services;

    b. Develop detailed and innovative proposals to create low barrier and cost-effective opportunities for:

        i. Community-based agencies, including peer-run agencies and organizations that are not currently licensed as behavioral health agencies under chapter 71.24 RCW, to bill health carriers for peer support services;

        ii. Service providers to bill health carriers for behavioral health services that are currently funded by the state general fund, including the law enforcement assisted diversion program established under RCW 71.24.589, the recovery navigator program established under RCW 71.24.115, the arrest and jail alternatives program established under RCW 36.28A.450, and the homeless outreach stabilization transition program established under RCW 71.24.145; and

        iii. Community-based victim services agencies, including agencies that support domestic violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking victims, to bill health carriers for peer support services provided to victims of gender-based violence;

    c. Develop a proposal to establish the concept of, and billing mechanisms for, substance use disorder peer-run respite centers that are modeled after the mental health peer-run respite centers established under RCW 71.24.649; and

    d. Explore options for health carriers to pay for peer support services through capitated payment arrangements rather than on a fee-for-service basis.

3. By November 1, 2026, the contracted entity or entities shall submit reports to the authority to describe the type and quantity of technical assistance that have been provided, the proposals that have been developed, and the trends in health carriers providing payment for peer support services, and any policy or budget recommendations to encourage health carriers to reimburse providers for peer support services.

2. [Empty]

    a. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, obtaining an endorsement under this section is voluntary.

    b. A certified peer support specialist must hold an endorsement in a category under subsection (1) of this section if:

        i. The certified peer support specialist is employed by a victim services agency;

        ii. The certified peer support specialist is providing peer support services to a client of the victim services agency who has experienced domestic violence, sexual assault, or human trafficking; and

        iii. The victim services agency seeks to bill a medical assistance program under chapter 74.09 RCW or a health carrier for the certified peer support specialist's services to the client.

    c. A victim services agency may only bill for peer support services if the certified peer support specialist holds an endorsement in a category that is relevant to the client's experience with domestic violence, sexual assault, or human trafficking. A certified peer support specialist is not required to hold an endorsement to provide peer support services to the client of a victim services agency if the victim services agency does not seek reimbursement for the peer support services.

3. As used in this section, the term "victim services agency" means a nonprofit program or organization that provides, as its primary purpose, assistance and advocacy for persons who have experienced domestic violence, sexual assault, or human trafficking. Services may include crisis intervention, individual and group support, information, referrals, and safety planning.

## Section 4
1. By July 1, 2026, the office of crime victims advocacy established under RCW 43.280.080 shall develop courses of instruction for certified peer support specialists to receive an endorsement in any of the three categories of practice areas under section 3 of this act. The courses must supplement the instruction received by certified peer support specialists under RCW 71.24.920 with an emphasis on the application of the skills taught in the certification training to providing peer support services to persons who have experienced domestic violence, sexual assault, or human trafficking, as applicable. The courses must also incorporate competencies that are typically taught in training programs for victim advocates, including safety planning, a foundational understanding of domestic violence, sexual assault, or human trafficking, as applicable, and advocacy across legal, medical, social services, and other systems. The office shall consult with the department of health to determine the appropriate length and content of the courses.

2. The office shall offer the courses on a regular basis or contract with an entity or entities to offer the courses. The courses must be available to certified peer support specialists at no cost.

3. The office shall collaborate with the department of health to develop a process to verify to the department that the certified peer support specialist has completed the training.

## Section 5
(1) This chapter applies only to the secretary and the boards and commissions having jurisdiction in relation to the professions licensed under the chapters specified in this section. This chapter does not apply to any business or profession not licensed under the chapters specified in this section.

## Section 6
(1) In lieu of disciplinary action under RCW 18.130.160 and if the disciplining authority determines that the unprofessional conduct may be the result of an applicable impairing or potentially impairing health condition, the disciplining authority may refer the license holder to a physician health program or a voluntary substance use disorder monitoring program approved by the disciplining authority.

## Section 7
1. The legislature finds that peers play a critical role along the behavioral health continuum of care, from outreach to treatment to recovery support. Peers deal in the currency of hope and motivation. Peers bring hope to individuals receiving services and are incredibly adept at supporting people with behavioral health challenges on their recovery journeys. Peers represent the only segment of the behavioral health workforce where there is not a shortage, but a surplus of willing workers. Peers, however, are presently limited to serving only medicaid recipients and working only in community behavioral health agencies. As a result, youth and adults with commercial insurance have no access to peer services. Furthermore, peers who work in other settings, such as emergency departments and behavioral health urgent care, cannot bill insurance for their services.

2. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to address the behavioral health workforce crisis, expand access to peer services, eliminate financial barriers to professional licensing, and honor the contributions of the peer profession by creating the profession of certified peer support specialists.

## Section 8

## Section 18
Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter.

## Section 19
1. [Empty]

    a. The state of Washington declares that substance use disorders are medical conditions. Substance use disorders should be treated in a manner similar to other medical conditions by using interventions that are supported by evidence, including medications approved by the federal food and drug administration for the treatment of opioid use disorder. It is also recognized that many individuals have multiple substance use disorders, as well as histories of trauma, developmental disabilities, or mental health conditions. As such, all individuals experiencing opioid use disorder should be offered evidence-supported treatments to include federal food and drug administration approved medications for the treatment of opioid use disorders and behavioral counseling and social supports to address them. For behavioral health agencies, an effective plan of treatment for most persons with opioid use disorder integrates access to medications and psychosocial counseling and should be consistent with the American society of addiction medicine patient placement criteria. Providers must inform patients with opioid use disorder or substance use disorder of options to access federal food and drug administration approved medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder or substance use disorder. Because some such medications are controlled substances in chapter 69.50 RCW, the state of Washington maintains the legal obligation and right to regulate the uses of these medications in the treatment of opioid use disorder.

    b. The authority must work with other state agencies and stakeholders to develop value-based payment strategies to better support the ongoing care of persons with opioid and other substance use disorders.

    c. The department of corrections shall develop policies to prioritize services based on available grant funding and funds appropriated specifically for opioid use disorder treatment.

2. The authority must promote the use of medication therapies and other evidence-based strategies to address the opioid epidemic in Washington state. Additionally, by January 1, 2020, the authority must prioritize state resources for the provision of treatment and recovery support services to inpatient and outpatient treatment settings that allow patients to start or maintain their use of medications for opioid use disorder while engaging in services.

3. The state declares that the main goals of treatment for persons with opioid use disorder are the cessation of unprescribed opioid use, reduced morbidity, and restoration of the ability to lead a productive and fulfilling life.

4. To achieve the goals in subsection (3) of this section, to promote public health and safety, and to promote the efficient and economic use of funding for the medicaid program under Title XIX of the social security act, the authority may seek, receive, and expend alternative sources of funding to support all aspects of the state's response to the opioid crisis.

5. The authority must partner with the department of social and health services, the department of corrections, the department of health, the department of children, youth, and families, and any other agencies or entities the authority deems appropriate to develop a statewide approach to leveraging medicaid funding to treat opioid use disorder and provide emergency overdose treatment. Such alternative sources of funding may include:

    a. Seeking a section 1115 demonstration waiver from the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services to fund opioid treatment medications for persons eligible for medicaid at or during the time of incarceration and juvenile detention facilities; and

    b. Soliciting and receiving private funds, grants, and donations from any willing person or entity.

## Section 20
(1) Establishing the state designated 988 contact hubs and enhancing the crisis response system will require collaborative work between the department, the authority, and regional system partners within their respective roles. The department shall have primary responsibility for designating 988 contact hubs, and shall seek recommendations from the behavioral health administrative services organizations to determine which 988 contact hubs best meet regional needs. The authority shall have primary responsibility for developing, implementing, and facilitating coordination of the crisis response system and services to support the work of the designated 988 contact hubs, regional crisis lines, and other coordinated regional behavioral health crisis response system partners. In any instance in which one agency is identified as the lead, the expectation is that agency will communicate and collaborate with the other to ensure seamless, continuous, and effective service delivery within the statewide crisis response system.

## Section 21
1. By April 1, 2024, the authority shall establish standards for issuing an endorsement to any mobile rapid response crisis team or community-based crisis team that meets the criteria under either subsection (2) or (3) of this section, as applicable.

The vehicle standards must allow for an ambulance or aid vehicle licensed under chapter 18.73 RCW to be deemed to meet the standards; and

    c. Standards for the initial and ongoing training of personnel and for providing clinical supervision to personnel.

3. The authority must adjust the standards for issuing an endorsement to a community-based crisis team under subsection (2) of this section if the team is comprised solely of an emergency medical services agency, whether it is part of a fire service agency or a private entity, that is located in a rural county in eastern Washington with a population of less than 60,000 residents. Under the adjusted standards, until January 1, 2030, the authority shall exempt a team from the personnel standards under subsection (2)(a) of this section and issue an endorsement to a team if:

    a.

The decision of a mobile rapid response crisis team or community-based crisis team to seek endorsement is voluntary and does not prohibit a nonendorsed team from participating in the crisis response system when (i) responding to individuals who are not experiencing a significant behavioral health emergency that requires an urgent in-person response or (ii) responding to individuals who are experiencing a significant behavioral health emergency that requires an urgent in-person response when there is not an endorsed team available.

    b. The decision of a mobile rapid response crisis team not to pursue an endorsement under this section does not affect its obligation to comply with any standards adopted by the authority with respect to mobile rapid response crisis teams.

    c. The decision of a mobile rapid response crisis team not to pursue an endorsement under this section does not affect its responsibilities and reimbursement for services as they may be defined in contracts with managed care organizations or behavioral health administrative services organizations.

11. The authority shall contract with the actuaries responsible for development of medicaid managed care rates to conduct an analysis and develop options for payment mechanisms and levels for rate enhancements under subsection (10) of this section. The authority shall consult with staff from the office of financial management and the fiscal committees of the legislature in conducting this analysis. The payment mechanisms must be developed to maximize leverage of allowable federal medicaid match. The analysis must clearly identify assumptions, include cost projections for the rate level options broken out by fund source, and summarize data used for the cost analysis. The cost projections must be based on Washington state specific utilization and cost data. The analysis must identify low, medium, and high ranges of projected costs associated for each option accounting for varying scenarios regarding the numbers of teams estimated to qualify for the enhanced case rates and supplemental performance payments. The analysis must identify costs for both medicaid clients, and for state-funded nonmedicaid clients paid through contracts with behavioral health administrative services organizations. The analysis must account for phasing in of the number of teams that meet endorsement criteria over time and project annual costs for a four-year period associated with each of the scenarios. The authority shall submit a report summarizing the analysis, payment mechanism options, enhanced performance payment and supplemental performance payment rate level options, and related cost estimates to the office of financial management and the appropriate committees of the legislature by December 1, 2023.

12. The authority shall conduct a review of the endorsed community-based crisis teams established under subsection (3) of this section and report to the governor and the health policy committees of the legislature by December 1, 2028.
