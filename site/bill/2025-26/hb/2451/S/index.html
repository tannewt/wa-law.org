If a sponsoring jurisdiction creates two increment areas, the total combined assessed valuation in both of the two increment areas may not equal more than $200,000,000 as adjusted annually by the consumer price index or more than 20 percent of the sponsoring jurisdiction's total assessed valuation, whichever is less, when the ordinances are passed creating the increment areas.</p>

<p>(C) The sponsoring jurisdiction enacted an ordinance designating the increment area no later than June 30, 2026; and</p>
<p>(D) A governing body of any taxing district within the increment area approves by a majority vote, and according to the governing body's ordinance and publication procedures, the taxing district's partial or full participation in the tax increment project. If the governing body does not approve its participation, the taxing district's property taxes are not subject to apportionment under this chapter and the taxing district is excluded from the provisions of this section;</p>
<pre><code>d. Except as otherwise provided in (c)(ii) of this subsection, a local government can create no more than two active increment areas at any given time and they may not physically overlap by including the same land in more than one increment area created by any local government at any time;

e. The ordinance must set a sunset date for the increment area, which must be the earlier of no more than 25 years after the first year in which tax allocation revenues are collected from the increment area or the date that the tax allocation revenues equal the maximum amount of public improvements obligations, including any debt service obligations identified in the ordinance;

f. The ordinance must identify the public improvements to be financed and indicate whether the local government intends to issue bonds or other obligations, payable in whole or in part, from tax allocation revenues to finance the public improvement costs, and must estimate the maximum amount of obligations contemplated;

g. The ordinance must provide that the increment area takes effect on June 1st following the adoption of the ordinance in (a) of this subsection;

h. The sponsoring jurisdiction may not add additional public improvements to the project after adoption of the ordinance creating the increment area or change the boundaries of the increment area. The sponsoring jurisdiction may expand, alter, or add to the original public improvements when doing so is necessary to assure the originally approved improvements can be constructed or operated;

    i. The ordinance must impose a deadline by which commencement of construction of the public improvements shall begin, which deadline must be no more than five years into the future and for which extensions not to exceed two years shall be made available for good cause;

j. The local government must make a finding that:

    i. The public improvements proposed to be paid or financed with tax allocation revenues are necessary to encourage private development within the increment area and to increase the assessed value of real property within the increment area;

    ii. Private development that is anticipated to occur within the increment area as a result of the proposed public improvements will be permitted consistent with the permitting jurisdiction's applicable zoning and development standards;

    iii. The private development would not reasonably be expected to occur solely through private investment within the reasonably foreseeable future without the proposed public improvements; and

    iv. The increased assessed value within the increment area that could reasonably be expected to occur without the proposed public improvements would be less than the increase in the assessed value estimated to result from the proposed development with the proposed public improvements; and

k. The ordinance may not include areas within an increment area that already have the necessary public improvements that are required for the private development expected to be made possible by the adoption of the increment area and may not include areas within an increment area where a private building or structure is under construction, has an active application for construction, has a valid permit for construction, or is undergoing a project-level environmental review process under chapter 43.21C RCW, unless the sponsoring jurisdiction can demonstrate that the public improvements developed in the increment area are necessary for the private development of projects that are seeking permit applications or under construction at the time the increment area is approved, before the formation of an increment area.

<p>If the parties cannot agree pursuant to (a) of this subsection (5), the parties must proceed to arbitration to determine the appropriate mitigation plan.
