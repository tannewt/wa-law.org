<p>The purpose of this act is to eliminate the office of financial management and partially recover the $30 million that the office of financial management misallocated during the 2023-2025 budget cycle. It is anticipated in making these changes, general fund—state expenditures will be reduced by $27.8 million, with the remaining funds currently authorized for use by the office of financial management being rededicated to the functions that are not eliminated, but passed on to the department of revenue, the state auditor's office, and the state treasurer's office.</p>
