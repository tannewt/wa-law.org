<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds and declares the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Access to abortion is a human right, an integral part of essential health care, and vital for promoting public health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are approximately 196,000 pregnancy capable students attending Washington's public institutions of higher education and many of these students need access to abortion services each year. A central mission of Washington's student health centers serving these institutions is to minimize the negative impact of health concerns on students' studies and to facilitate retention and graduation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students seeking pregnancy termination face substantial travel, financial, and logistical barriers. Students must travel as far as 78 miles, or over four hours on public transit, round trip to the nearest abortion-providing facility, and the average wait time for an appointment is 10 days. The supreme court Dobbs v. Jackson women's health organization decision has increased the burden on abortion-providing facilities in the state, meaning longer wait times for students needing to access care. A 2024 report from senator Maria Cantwell's office states that clinics in Oregon have already seen a 50 percent increase in patients from Washington state traveling for abortion care, and the average wait times in Washington for abortion appointments in a Seattle area clinic have already increased by one week due to the influx of patients traveling from out of state. These financial and time burdens negatively impact academic performance, mental health, and physical health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Though many of Washington's public institutions of higher education have student health centers, only one campus student health center currently offers medical abortion services and only one other is known to be in the process of implementing abortion services. Medication abortion is extremely safe, efficacious, and cost-effective. Research shows that the provision of medication abortion in student health centers is safe, effective, and feasible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because medication abortion is recognized as a safe and effective treatment for pregnancy termination and a health service every pregnant person in the state has the legal right to choose, it is the intent of the legislature that public institutions of higher education make medication abortion as accessible and cost-effective for students as possible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
