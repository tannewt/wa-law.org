<p>If the final digit of a cash transaction ends in one cent, two cents, six cents, or seven cents, the final digit may be rounded down to the nearest amount divisible by five cents;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the final digit of a cash transaction ends in three cents, four cents, eight cents, or nine cents, the final digit may be rounded up to the nearest amount divisible by five cents; or</p>

<p>For mixed-tender transactions, any amount paid by a customer in cash must first be applied to the sales price of the goods or services, and any remaining balance may be paid through electronic or noncash methods, such that rounding is not applied to any portion of the transaction paid by noncash methods.</p>
</li>
