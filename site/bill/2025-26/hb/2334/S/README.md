## Section 1
1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the total price of any in-person cash transaction may be rounded to the nearest five cent increment as follows:

    a. If the final digit of a cash transaction ends in one cent, two cents, six cents, or seven cents, the final digit may be rounded down to the nearest amount divisible by five cents;

    b. If the final digit of a cash transaction ends in three cents, four cents, eight cents, or nine cents, the final digit may be rounded up to the nearest amount divisible by five cents; or

    c. If the final digit of a cash transaction ends in zero cents or five cents, the final digit may not be rounded up or down.

2. This section applies only to in-person payments made by legal tender. This section does not apply to transactions for which payment is made by any demand or negotiable instrument, electronic funds transfer, money order, credit card, debit card, electronic payment, or other like instrument.

3. For mixed-tender transactions, any amount paid by a customer in cash must first be applied to the sales price of the goods or services, and any remaining balance may be paid through electronic or noncash methods, such that rounding is not applied to any portion of the transaction paid by noncash methods.

4. Rounding to the nearest amount divisible by five cents under subsection (1) of this section applies solely to the payment amount tendered and does not alter the sales price, the amount of tax owed or collected, or any surcharges, assessments, or applicable fees imposed on the sale.
