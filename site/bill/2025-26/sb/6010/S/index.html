<li>
<p>The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to normal maintenance and repairs which do not increase the capacity or dimensions beyond those set forth in RCW 80.50.020 (14) and (29).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applications for certification of energy facilities made prior to July 15, 1977, shall continue to be governed by the applicable provisions of law in effect on the day immediately preceding July 15, 1977, with the exceptions of RCW 80.50.071 which shall apply to such prior applications and to site certifications prospectively from July 15, 1977.</p>

<p>The department of archaeology and historic preservation; and</p>

<p>The council must consult with all federally recognized tribes that possess resources, rights, or interests reserved or protected by federal treaty, statute, or executive order in the area where an energy facility is proposed to be located to provide early and meaningful participation and input during siting review and compliance monitoring. Upon the receipt of an application for certification, the chair and designated staff shall offer to conduct government-to-government consultation to seek ways to address issues of concern raised by such a tribe. As part of the consultation process, and upon request of the tribe to meet with the full council, consultation shall include as many members of the council as can be arranged.

Attendance by a quorum of the council at the consultation does not constitute a meeting under chapter 42.30 RCW, provided that there is no deliberation between the members of the council and that no assurances or commitments are made by members of the council. The goal of the consultation process is for the tribe to provide information regarding tribal resources or rights potentially affected by the proposed energy facility , as well as ways to avoid, minimize, or mitigate any adverse effects on tribal resources or rights.  The report from the council to the governor required in RCW 80.50.100 must include a summary of the government-to-government consultation process that complies with RCW 42.56.300, including the issues and proposed resolutions. The council's summary shall be provided to the tribe before it is submitted to the governor and the tribe will have 30 days to request any corrections or additional information be included in the summary, or to provide its own summary to be included in the council's report to the governor required in RCW 80.50.100.</p>
