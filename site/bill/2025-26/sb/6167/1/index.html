<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that homeownership is a cornerstone of economic stability, family security, and generational wealth. State-funded down payment assistance programs exist to open the door to homeownership for individuals and families who might not otherwise have that opportunity. These programs are funded with limited public dollars, and their success depends on ensuring that assistance is distributed fairly, transparently, and in a manner that reaches as many qualified first-time homebuyers as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that in recent years, instances of &quot;stacking&quot; multiple state-funded down payment assistance programs have reduced the overall reach of these investments. While each program was created with good intentions, they were not designed to provide multiple overlapping assistance to a single buyer. When one homebuyer receives more assistance than needed to successfully purchase a home, another family waiting for help is left without a path forward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to reaffirm the original purpose of these programs: To expand access to homeownership, not concentrate benefits. By limiting homebuyers to one state-funded down payment assistance loan or grant, the state can responsibly stretch limited resources, support a greater number of first-time homebuyers, and uphold the public's trust in the integrity of these programs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The community reinvestment account is created in the state treasury. Revenues to the account shall consist of appropriations and transfers by the legislature and all other moneys directed for deposit into the account. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation.</p>

However, a homebuyer is prohibited from receiving multiple state-funded down payment assistance loans or grants from any programs created under this section or RCW 43.185A.140 or 43.181.040. A homebuyer who applies for down payment assistance loans or grants under multiple state-funded programs, or for multiple down payment assistance loans or grants under one state-funded program, is only eligible to accept one state-funded loan or grant offer;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Civil and criminal legal assistance to provide postconviction relief and case assistance, including the expungement of criminal records and vacation of criminal convictions;</p>

If the covenant homeownership program study identifies an economically disadvantaged class or classes of persons that share one or more common characteristics such as, race, national origin, or sex and the board of the commission finds it necessary to consider this information in tailoring a special purpose credit program to provide credit assistance to economically disadvantaged classes of persons, the commission may consider these characteristics in designing and implementing the program.</p>
