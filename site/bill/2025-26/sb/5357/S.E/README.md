## Section 1
The legislature hereby revises the normal cost contribution rates adopted by the pension funding council at its July 17, 2024, meeting for the 2025-2027 fiscal biennium to reflect updated projections regarding the funded status of each pension plan and the fact that contribution rates are expected to decline over the next six years. This change allows the legislature to responsibly leverage the well-funded status of Washington's pension systems to alleviate fiscal pressure, while ensuring the stability and long-term sustainability of the pension funds.
