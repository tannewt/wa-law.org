</li>
<li>
<p>The board may not deny a spirits retail license to an otherwise qualified contract liquor store at its contract location or to the holder of former state liquor store operating rights sold at auction under RCW 66.24.620 on the grounds of location, nature, or size of the premises to be licensed. The board may not deny a spirits retail license to applicants that are not contract liquor stores or operating rights holders on the grounds of the size of the premises to be licensed, if such applicant is otherwise qualified and the board determines that:</p>

The board must periodically review and adjust the renewal fee as may be required to maintain it as comparable to annual license renewal fees for licenses to sell beer and wine not for consumption on the licensed premises. If required by law at the time, any increase of the annual renewal fee becomes effective only upon ratification by the legislature.</p>

<p>As a condition to receiving and renewing a spirits retail license the licensee must provide training as prescribed by the board by rule for individuals who sell spirits or who manage others who sell spirits regarding compliance with laws and regulations regarding sale of spirits, including without limitation the prohibitions against sale of spirits to individuals who are underage or visibly intoxicated. The training must be provided before the individual first engages in the sale of spirits and must be renewed at least every five years.

<li>
<p>As limited by (b) of this subsection , each spirits distributor licensee must pay to the board, for deposit into the liquor revolving fund, a license issuance fee calculated as follows:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>In each of the first 27 months of licensure, 10 percent of the total revenue from all the licensee's sales of spirits made during the month for which the fee is due, respectively; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the 28th month of licensure and each month thereafter, five percent of the total revenue from all the licensee's sales of spirits made during the month for which the fee is due, respectively.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fee required under this subsection (3) is calculated only on sales of items which the licensee was the first spirits distributor in the state to have received:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>In the case of spirits manufactured in the state, from the distiller; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of spirits manufactured outside the state, from an authorized out‑of‑state supplier.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>c.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A retail licensee selling for resale must pay a distributor license fee under the terms and conditions in this section on resales of spirits the licensee has purchased on which no other distributor license fee has been paid. The board must establish rules setting forth the frequency and timing of such payments and reporting of sales dollar volume by the licensee, with payments due quarterly in arrears.</p>
<pre><code>d. No spirits inventory may be subject to calculation of more than a single spirits distributor license issuance fee.

e. The fees in this subsection (3) do not apply to the sale of low-proof beverages.
</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>In addition to the payment set forth in subsection (3) of this section, each spirits distributor licensee renewing its annual license must pay an annual license renewal fee of $1,320 for each licensed location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no minimum facility size or capacity for spirits distributor licenses, and no limit on the number of such licenses issued to qualified applicants. License applicants must provide physical security of the product that is substantially as effective as the physical security of the distribution facilities currently operated by the board with respect to preventing pilferage. License issuances and renewals are subject to RCW 66.24.010 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, including without limitation rights of cities, towns, county legislative authorities, the public, churches, schools, and public institutions to object to or prevent issuance of local liquor licenses. However, existing distributor premises licensed to sell beer and/or wine are deemed to be premises &quot;now licensed&quot; under RCW 66.24.010(9)(a) for the purpose of processing applications for spirits distributor licenses.</p>
