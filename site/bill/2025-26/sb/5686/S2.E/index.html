<li>
<p>A unit owner who is or may become delinquent to an association for an assessment charged may contact a housing counselor to receive housing counseling services.</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>Preparing the unit owner for meetings with the association;</p>

<p>Nothing in RCW 64.32.200, 64.34.364, 64.38.100, 64.90.485, or this section precludes a meeting or negotiations between the housing counselor, unit owner, and the association at any time, including after the issuance of a notice of delinquency by the association for past due assessments to the unit owner by the association.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A unit owner who seeks the assistance of a housing counselor may use the assistance of an attorney at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A housing counselor or attorney assisting a unit owner may refer the unit owner to mediation, pursuant to RCW 61.24.163. Prior to referring the unit owner to mediation, the housing counselor or attorney shall cause the unit owner and association to meet and confer over the assessment charged, and following this meet and confer shall determine whether mediation is appropriate based on the individual circumstances. The meet and confer should occur within 30 days of the unit owner contacting the housing counselor or attorney for assistance. The meet and confer may be done by telephone or videoconferencing. For the meet and confer, the unit owner and the association shall be responsible for their own respective attorney fees, if any, incurred; however, legal representation is not required for either party participating in the meet and confer. If the association refuses to participate in the meet and confer then the unit owner can request within 30 days of the association's refusal that the housing counselor refer the matter to mediation.</p>

<p>During the 30 day time period between the unit owner contacting the housing counselor and the meet and confer session with the association, the association is prohibited from charging to the unit owner any attorney fees the association may have incurred attempting to collect the past due assessment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The referral to mediation may be made at any time but no later than 90 days prior to the date of sale listed in a notice of trustee's sale provided to the unit owner. If an amended notice of trustee's sale is recorded after the trustee sale has been stayed pursuant to RCW 61.24.130, the unit owner may be referred to mediation no later than 25 days prior to the date of sale listed in the amended notice of trustee's sale.</p>

<p>The borrower, the beneficiary or authorized agent, and the mediator must meet in person for the mediation session.

However, a person with authority to agree to a resolution on behalf of the beneficiary or association may be present over the telephone or videoconference during the mediation session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the mediation session commences, the mediator may continue the mediation session once, and any further continuances must be with the consent of the parties.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For deed of trust foreclosures, the participants in mediation must address the issues of foreclosure that may enable the borrower or unit owner and the beneficiary or association to reach a resolution, including but not limited to reinstatement, modification of the loan, restructuring of the debt, modification of a delinquent assessment, modification of late fees or charges associated with a delinquent assessment, or some other workout plan. To assist the parties in addressing issues of foreclosure, the mediator may require the participants to consider the following:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>A request by a beneficiary that the borrower waive future claims he or she may have in connection with the deed of trust, as a condition of agreeing to a modification, except for rescission claims under the federal truth in lending act. Nothing in this section precludes a beneficiary or association from requesting that a borrower dismiss with prejudice any pending claims against the beneficiary, its agents, loan servicer, or trustee, arising from the underlying deed of trust, as a condition of modification; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A request by the association that the unit owner waive future claims against the association. Nothing in this section precludes an association from requesting that a unit owner dismiss any filed civil claims against the association related to the present delinquency.</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the mediator reasonably believes a borrower or unit owner will not attend a mediation session based on the borrower's or unit owner's conduct, such as the lack of response to the mediator's communications, the mediator may cancel a scheduled mediation session and send a written cancellation to the department and the trustee and send copies to the parties. The beneficiary or association may proceed with the foreclosure after receipt of the mediator's written confirmation of cancellation.</p>

<p>The mediator's certification that the beneficiary or association failed to act in good faith in mediation constitutes a defense to the nonjudicial foreclosure action that was the basis for initiating the mediation. In any action to enjoin the foreclosure, the beneficiary or association is entitled to rebut the allegation that it failed to act in good faith.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mediator's certification that the beneficiary or association failed to act in good faith during mediation does not constitute a defense to a judicial foreclosure or a future nonjudicial foreclosure action if a modification of the loan or delinquent assessment payment plan is agreed upon and the borrower subsequently defaults or unit owner fails to pay assessments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an affordable loan modification is not offered in the mediation or a written agreement was not reached and the mediator's certification shows that the net present value of the modified loan exceeds the anticipated net recovery at foreclosure, that showing in the certification constitutes a basis for the borrower to enjoin the foreclosure.</p>

<p>If a borrower or unit owner has been referred to mediation before a notice of trustee sale has been recorded, a trustee may not record the notice of sale until the trustee receives the mediator's certification stating that the mediation has been completed. If the trustee does not receive the mediator's certification, the trustee may record the notice of sale after 10 days from the date the certification to the trustee was due. If, after a notice of sale is recorded under this subsection (19)(a), the mediator subsequently issues a certification finding that the beneficiary or association violated the duty of good faith, the certification constitutes a basis for the borrower or unit owner to enjoin the foreclosure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a borrower or unit owner has been referred to mediation after the notice of sale was recorded, the sale may not occur until the trustee receives the mediator's certification stating that the mediation has been completed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a unit owner has been referred to mediation before the filing of a judicial foreclosure, the association may not file a complaint for judicial foreclosure until the association receives the mediator's certification stating that the mediation has been completed. If the association does not receive the mediator's certification, the association may file for judicial foreclosure after 10 days from the date the certification to the association was due.</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A mediator may charge reasonable fees as authorized by this subsection or as authorized by the department. Unless the fee is waived, the parties agree otherwise, or the department otherwise authorizes, a foreclosure mediator's fee may not exceed $400 for preparing, scheduling, and conducting a mediation session lasting between one hour and three hours. For a mediation session exceeding three hours, the foreclosure mediator may charge a reasonable fee, as authorized by the department. The mediator must provide an estimated fee before the mediation, and payment of the mediator's fee must be divided equally between the beneficiary and the borrower, or between the association and the unit owner. The beneficiary and the borrower, or the association and the unit owner, must tender the loan mediator's fee within 30 calendar days from receipt of the department's letter referring the parties to mediation or pursuant to the mediator's instructions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For association foreclosures, the unit owner and the association shall be responsible for their own respective attorney fees, if any, incurred during mediation under this section. Legal representation is not required for either party participating in an association foreclosure mediation.</p>

<p>Beginning December 1, 2012, and every year thereafter, the department shall report annually to the legislature on:</p>

<p>The association has a lien on a unit for any unpaid assessments levied against a unit from the time the assessment is due.</p>

<p>A lien under this section shall be prior to all other liens and encumbrances on a unit except: (a) Liens and encumbrances recorded before the recording of the declaration; (b) a mortgage on the unit recorded before the date on which the assessment sought to be enforced became delinquent; and (c) liens for real property taxes and other governmental assessments or charges against the unit. A lien under this section is not subject to the provisions of chapter 6.13 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsections (4) and (5) of this section, the lien shall also be prior to the mortgages described in subsection (2)(b) of this section to the extent of assessments for common expenses, excluding any amounts for capital improvements, based on the periodic budget adopted by the association pursuant to RCW 64.34.360(1) which would have become due during the six months immediately preceding the date of a sheriff's sale in an action for judicial foreclosure by either the association or a mortgagee, the date of a trustee's sale in a nonjudicial foreclosure by a mortgagee, or the date of recording of the declaration of forfeiture in a proceeding by the vendor under a real estate contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The priority of the association's lien against units encumbered by a mortgage held by an eligible mortgagee or by a mortgagee which has given the association a written request for a notice of delinquent assessments shall be reduced by up to three months if and to the extent that the lien priority under subsection (3) of this section includes delinquencies which relate to a period after such holder becomes an eligible mortgagee or has given such notice and before the association gives the holder a written notice of the delinquency. This subsection does not affect the priority of mechanics' or material suppliers' liens, or the priority of liens for other assessments made by the association.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the association forecloses its lien under this section nonjudicially pursuant to chapter 61.24 RCW, as provided by subsection (9) of this section, the association shall not be entitled to the lien priority provided for under subsection (3) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless the declaration otherwise provides, if two or more associations have liens for assessments created at any time on the same real estate, those liens have equal priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recording of the declaration constitutes record notice and perfection of the lien for assessments. While no further recording of any claim of lien for assessment under this section shall be required to perfect the association's lien, the association may record a notice of claim of lien for assessments under this section in the real property records of any county in which the condominium is located. Such recording shall not constitute the written notice of delinquency to a mortgagee referred to in subsection (2) of this section.</p>

<li>
<p>A lien for unpaid assessments and the personal liability for payment of assessments is extinguished unless proceedings to enforce the lien or collect the debt are instituted within three years after the amount of the assessments sought to be recovered becomes due.</p>

<li>
<p>The lien arising under this section may be enforced judicially by the association or its authorized representative in the manner set forth in chapter 61.12 RCW. The lien arising under this section may be enforced nonjudicially in the manner set forth in chapter 61.24 RCW for nonjudicial foreclosure of deeds of trust if the declaration (a) contains a grant of the condominium in trust to a trustee qualified under RCW 61.24.010 to secure the obligations of the unit owners to the association for the payment of assessments, (b) contains a power of sale, (c) provides in its terms that the units are not used principally for agricultural or farming purposes, and (d) provides that the power of sale is operative in the case of a default in the obligation to pay assessments. The association or its authorized representative shall have the power, unless prohibited by the declaration, to purchase the unit at the foreclosure sale and to acquire, hold, lease, mortgage, or convey the same. Upon an express waiver in the complaint of any right to a deficiency judgment in a judicial foreclosure action, the period of redemption shall be eight months. Nothing in this section shall prohibit an association from taking a deed in lieu of foreclosure.</p>

<p>From the time of commencement of an action by the association to foreclose a lien for nonpayment of delinquent assessments against a unit that is not occupied by the owner thereof, the association shall be entitled to the appointment of a receiver to collect from the lessee thereof the rent for the unit as and when due. If the rental is not paid, the receiver may obtain possession of the unit, refurbish it for rental up to a reasonable standard for rental units in this type of condominium, rent the unit or permit its rental to others, and apply the rents first to the cost of the receivership and attorneys' fees thereof, then to the cost of refurbishing the unit, then to applicable charges, then to costs, fees, and charges of the foreclosure action, and then to the payment of the delinquent assessments. Only a receiver may take possession and collect rents under this subsection, and a receiver shall not be appointed less than 90 days after the delinquency. The exercise by the association of the foregoing rights shall not affect the priority of preexisting liens on the unit.</p>

The association or its authorized representative may purchase the unit at the foreclosure sale and acquire, hold, lease, mortgage, or convey the unit. Upon an express waiver in the complaint of any right to a deficiency judgment in a judicial foreclosure action, the period of redemption is eight months.</p>

<p>In a cooperative in which the unit owners' interests in the units are real estate, the association's lien must be foreclosed in like manner as a mortgage on real estate or by power of sale under (b) of this subsection.</p>

<li>
<p>No member of the association's board, or their immediate family members or affiliates, are eligible to bid for or purchase, directly or indirectly, any interest in a unit at a foreclosure of the association's lien. For the purposes of this subsection, &quot;immediate family member&quot; includes spouses, domestic partners, children, siblings, parents, parents-in-law, and stepfamily members; and &quot;affiliate&quot; of a board member includes any person controlled by the board member, including any entity in which the board member is a general partner, managing member, majority member, officer, or director. Nothing in this subsection prohibits an association from bidding for or purchasing interest in a unit at a foreclosure of the association's lien.</p>

<li>
<p>If the unit owner's interest in a unit in a cooperative is real estate, the following requirements apply:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The association, upon nonpayment of assessments and compliance with this subsection, may sell that unit at a public sale or by private negotiation, and at any time and place. The association must give to the unit owner and any lessee of the unit owner reasonable notice in a record of the time, date, and place of any public sale or, if a private sale is intended, of the intention of entering into a contract to sell and of the time and date after which a private conveyance may be made. Such notice must also be sent to any other person that has a recorded interest in the unit that would be cut off by the sale, but only if the recorded interest was on record seven weeks before the date specified in the notice as the date of any public sale or seven weeks before the date specified in the notice as the date after which a private sale may be made. The notices required under this subsection may be sent to any address reasonable in the circumstances. A sale may not be held until five weeks after the sending of the notice. The association may buy at any public sale and, if the sale is conducted by a fiduciary or other person not related to the association, at a private sale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise agreed to or as stated in this section, the unit owner is liable for any deficiency in a foreclosure sale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proceeds of a foreclosure sale must be applied in the following order:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The reasonable expenses of sale;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reasonable expenses of securing possession before sale; the reasonable expenses of holding, maintaining, and preparing the unit for sale, including payment of taxes and other governmental charges and premiums on insurance; and, to the extent provided for by agreement between the association and the unit owner, reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and other legal expenses incurred by the association;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Satisfaction of the association's lien;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Satisfaction in the order of priority of any subordinate claim of record; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remittance of any excess to the unit owner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A good-faith purchaser for value acquires the unit free of the association's debt that gave rise to the lien under which the foreclosure sale occurred and any subordinate interest, even though the association or other person conducting the sale failed to comply with this section. The person conducting the sale must execute a conveyance to the purchaser sufficient to convey the unit and stating that it is executed by the person after a foreclosure of the association's lien by power of sale and that the person was empowered to make the sale. Signature and title or authority of the person signing the conveyance as grantor and a recital of the facts of nonpayment of the assessment and of the giving of the notices required under this subsection are sufficient proof of the facts recited and of the authority to sign. Further proof of authority is not required even though the association is named as grantee in the conveyance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At any time before the association has conveyed a unit in a cooperative or entered into a contract for its conveyance under the power of sale, the unit owners or the holder of any subordinate security interest may cure the unit owner's default and prevent sale or other conveyance by tendering the performance due under the security agreement, including any amounts due because of exercise of a right to accelerate, plus the reasonable expenses of proceeding to foreclosure incurred to the time of tender, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of the creditor.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In an action by an association to collect assessments or to foreclose a lien on a unit under this section, the court may appoint a receiver to collect all sums alleged to be due and owing to a unit owner before commencement or during pendency of the action. The receivership is governed under chapter 7.60 RCW. During pendency of the action, the court may order the receiver to pay sums held by the receiver to the association for any assessments against the unit. The exercise of rights under this subsection by the association does not affect the priority of preexisting liens on the unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the holder of a mortgage or other purchaser of a unit who obtains the right of possession of the unit through foreclosure is not liable for assessments or installments of assessments that became due prior to such right of possession. Such unpaid assessments are deemed to be common expenses collectible from all the unit owners, including such mortgagee or other purchaser of the unit. Foreclosure of a mortgage does not relieve the prior unit owner of personal liability for assessments accruing against the unit prior to the date of such sale as provided in this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to constituting a lien on the unit, each assessment is the joint and several obligation of the unit owner of the unit to which the same are assessed as of the time the assessment is due. A unit owner may not exempt himself or herself from liability for assessments. In a voluntary conveyance other than by foreclosure, the grantee of a unit is jointly and severally liable with the grantor for all unpaid assessments against the grantor up to the time of the grantor's conveyance, without prejudice to the grantee's right to recover from the grantor the amounts paid by the grantee. Suit to recover a personal judgment for any delinquent assessment is maintainable in any court of competent jurisdiction without foreclosing or waiving the lien securing such sums.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The association may from time to time establish reasonable late charges and a rate of interest to be charged, not to exceed the maximum rate calculated under RCW 19.52.020, on all subsequent delinquent assessments or installments of assessments. If the association does not establish such a rate, delinquent assessments bear interest from the date of delinquency at the maximum rate calculated under RCW 19.52.020 on the date on which the assessments became delinquent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The association is entitled to recover any costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with the collection of delinquent assessments, whether or not such collection activities result in a suit being commenced or prosecuted to judgment. The prevailing party is also entitled to recover costs and reasonable attorneys' fees in such suits, including any appeals, if it prevails on appeal and in the enforcement of a judgment.</p>
