A resolution may include, but is not limited to, modification of the loan, an agreement to conduct a short sale, a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction, a delinquent assessment payment plan, or some other workout plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in RCW 61.24.031 or this section precludes a meeting or negotiations between the housing counselor, borrower, and beneficiary at any time, including after the issuance of the notice of default.

<li>
<p>After the mediation session commences, the mediator may continue the mediation session once, and any further continuances must be with the consent of the parties.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For deed of trust foreclosures, the participants in mediation must address the issues of foreclosure that may enable the borrower or unit owner and the beneficiary or association to reach a resolution, including but not limited to reinstatement, modification of the loan, restructuring of the debt, modification of a delinquent assessment, modification of late fees or charges associated with a delinquent assessment, or some other workout plan. To assist the parties in addressing issues of foreclosure, the mediator may require the participants to consider the following:</p>
<ol type="a">

</li>
<li>
<p>A violation of the duty to mediate in good faith as required under this section may include:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>A request by a beneficiary that the borrower waive future claims he or she may have in connection with the deed of trust, as a condition of agreeing to a modification, except for rescission claims under the federal truth in lending act.

</li>
<li>
<p>A request by the association that the unit owner waive future claims against the association. Nothing in this section precludes an association from requesting that a unit owner dismiss any filed civil claims against the association related to the present delinquency.</p>

<p>If the mediator reasonably believes a borrower or unit owner will not attend a mediation session based on the borrower's or unit owner's conduct, such as the lack of response to the mediator's communications, the mediator may cancel a scheduled mediation session and send a written cancellation to the department and the trustee and send copies to the parties. The beneficiary or association may proceed with the foreclosure after receipt of the mediator's written confirmation of cancellation.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The mediator's certification that the beneficiary or association failed to act in good faith during mediation does not constitute a defense to a judicial foreclosure or a future nonjudicial foreclosure action if a modification of the loan or delinquent assessment payment plan is agreed upon and the borrower subsequently defaults or unit owner fails to pay assessments.</p>

If, after a notice of sale is recorded under this subsection (19)(a), the mediator subsequently issues a certification finding that the beneficiary or association violated the duty of good faith, the certification constitutes a basis for the borrower or unit owner to enjoin the foreclosure.</p>

If the association does not receive the mediator's certification, the association may file for judicial foreclosure after 10 days from the date the certification to the association was due. If, after a judicial filing for foreclosure has been made pursuant to this subsection (19)(c), the mediator subsequently issues a certification finding that the association violated the duty of good faith, the certification constitutes a basis for the unit owner to enjoin the judicial foreclosure.</p>

<li>
<p>A mediator may charge reasonable fees as authorized by this subsection or as authorized by the department. Unless the fee is waived, the parties agree otherwise, or the department otherwise authorizes, a foreclosure mediator's fee may not exceed $400 for preparing, scheduling, and conducting a mediation session lasting between one hour and three hours. For a mediation session exceeding three hours, the foreclosure mediator may charge a reasonable fee, as authorized by the department. The mediator must provide an estimated fee before the mediation, and payment of the mediator's fee must be divided equally between the beneficiary and the borrower, or between the association and the unit owner. The beneficiary and the borrower, or the association and the unit owner, must tender the loan mediator's fee within 30 calendar days from receipt of the department's letter referring the parties to mediation or pursuant to the mediator's instructions.</p>

The department may make policies and procedures related to the implementation, collection, and management of the fee.</p>
<h2 id="section-9">Section 9 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9">¶</a></h2>
<p>The foreclosure fairness account is created in the custody of the state treasurer.

Funds provided under  subsection (3) of this section must be used to supplement, not supplant, other federal, state, and local funds. If the program needs do not require the full use of the allocation as set forth in this section, the department may reallocate those funds to increase the percentage allocated to another agency or organization authorized to receive those funds by this section.</p>
<p>The department shall enter into interagency agreements to contract with the Washington state housing finance commission and other appropriate entities to implement the foreclosure fairness act.</p>
