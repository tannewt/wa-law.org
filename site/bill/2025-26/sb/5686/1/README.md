The referral to mediation may be made any time after a notice of default or notice of delinquency for past due assessments has been issued but no later than 90 days prior to the date of sale listed in the notice of trustee's sale.

        iii. A statement that the parties have a duty to mediate in good faith and that failure to mediate in good faith may impair the beneficiary's or association's ability to foreclose on the property or the borrower's or unit owner's ability to modify the loan, modify obligations relating to the payment of assessments, or take advantage of other alternatives to foreclosure.

9. [Empty]

    a. The borrower or unit owner, the beneficiary or association or authorized agent, and the mediator must meet in person for the mediation session. However, a person with authority to agree to a resolution on behalf of the beneficiary or association may be present over the telephone or videoconference during the mediation session.

    b. After the mediation session commences, the mediator may continue the mediation session once, and any further continuances must be with the consent of the parties.

10. The participants in mediation must address the issues of foreclosure that may enable the borrower or unit owner and the beneficiary or association to reach a resolution, including but not limited to reinstatement, modification of the loan, restructuring of the debt, modification of a delinquent assessment, modification of late fees or charges associated with a delinquent assessment, or some other workout plan. To assist the parties in addressing issues of foreclosure, the mediator may require the participants to consider the following:

    a. The borrower's or unit owner's current and future economic circumstances, including the borrower's or unit owner's current and future income, debts, and obligations for the previous 60 days or greater time period as determined by the mediator;

    b. The net present value of receiving payments pursuant to a modified mortgage loan as compared to the anticipated net recovery following foreclosure;

    c. Any affordable loan modification calculation and net present value calculation when required under any federal mortgage relief program and any modification program related to loans insured by the federal housing administration, the veterans administration, and the rural housing service, if applicable. If such a calculation is not provided or required, then the beneficiary must provide the net present value data inputs established by the federal deposit insurance corporation and published in the federal deposit insurance corporation loan modification program guide or other net present value data inputs as designated by the department. The mediator may run the calculation in order for a productive mediation to occur and to comply with the mediator certification requirement; and

    d. Any other loss mitigation guidelines to loans insured by the federal housing administration, the veterans administration, and the rural housing service, if applicable.

11. A violation of the duty to mediate in good faith as required under this section may include:

    a. Failure to timely participate in mediation without good cause;

    b. Failure of the borrower , the unit owner, the beneficiary, or the association to provide the documentation required before mediation or pursuant to the mediator's instructions;

    c. Failure of a party to designate representatives with adequate authority to fully settle, compromise, or otherwise reach resolution with the borrower or unit owner in mediation; and

    d. A request by a beneficiary or association that the borrower or unit owner waive future claims he or she may have in connection with the deed of trust, as a condition of agreeing to a modification, except for rescission claims under the federal truth in lending act. Nothing in this section precludes a beneficiary or association from requesting that a borrower or unit owner dismiss with prejudice any pending claims against the beneficiary or association, its agents, loan servicer, or trustee, arising from the underlying deed of trust, as a condition of modification.

12. If the mediator reasonably believes a borrower or unit owner will not attend a mediation session based on the borrower's or unit owner's conduct, such as the lack of response to the mediator's communications, the mediator may cancel a scheduled mediation session and send a written cancellation to the department and the trustee and send copies to the parties. The beneficiary or association may proceed with the foreclosure after receipt of the mediator's written confirmation of cancellation.

13. Within seven business days after the conclusion of the mediation session, the mediator must send a written certification to the department and the trustee and send copies to the parties of:

    a. The date, time, and location of the mediation session;

14. If the parties are unable to reach an agreement, the beneficiary or association may proceed with the foreclosure after receipt of the mediator's written certification.

15. [Empty]

    a. The mediator's certification that the beneficiary or association failed to act in good faith in mediation constitutes a defense to the nonjudicial foreclosure action that was the basis for initiating the mediation. In any action to enjoin the foreclosure, the beneficiary is entitled to rebut the allegation that it failed to act in good faith.

    b. The mediator's certification that the beneficiary or association failed to act in good faith during mediation does not constitute a defense to a judicial foreclosure or a future nonjudicial foreclosure action if a modification of the loan or modification of obligations related to the payment of assessments is agreed upon and the borrower subsequently defaults.

    c. If an affordable loan modification or modification of obligations related to the payment of assessments is not offered in the mediation or a written agreement was not reached and the mediator's certification shows that the net present value of the modified loan or the obligations related to the payment of delinquent assessments including late fees and charges, exceeds the anticipated net recovery at foreclosure, that showing in the certification constitutes a basis for the borrower or unit owner to enjoin the foreclosure.

16. The mediator's certification that the borrower or unit owner failed to act in good faith in mediation authorizes the beneficiary or association to proceed with the foreclosure.

17. [Empty]

    a. If a borrower or unit owner has been referred to mediation before a notice of trustee sale has been recorded, a trustee may not record the notice of sale until the trustee receives the mediator's certification stating that the mediation has been completed. If the trustee does not receive the mediator's certification, the trustee may record the notice of sale after 10 days from the date the certification to the trustee was due. If, after a notice of sale is recorded under this subsection (17)(a), the mediator subsequently issues a certification finding that the beneficiary or association violated the duty of good faith, the certification constitutes a basis for the borrower or unit owner to enjoin the foreclosure.

    b. If a borrower or unit owner has been referred to mediation after the notice of sale was recorded, the sale may not occur until the trustee receives the mediator's certification stating that the mediation has been completed.

18. A mediator may charge reasonable fees as authorized by this subsection or as authorized by the department. Unless the fee is waived, the parties agree otherwise, or the department otherwise authorizes, a foreclosure mediator's fee may not exceed $400 for preparing, scheduling, and conducting a mediation session lasting between one hour and three hours. For a mediation session exceeding three hours, the foreclosure mediator may charge a reasonable fee, as authorized by the department. The mediator must provide an estimated fee before the mediation, and payment of the mediator's fee must be divided equally between the beneficiary and the borrower, or between the association and the unit owner. The beneficiary and the borrower, or the association and the unit owner, must tender the loan mediator's fee within 30 calendar days from receipt of the department's letter referring the parties to mediation or pursuant to the mediator's instructions.

19. Beginning December 1, 2012, and every year thereafter, the department shall report annually to the legislature on:

    a. The performance of the program, including the number of borrowers who are referred to mediation by a housing counselor or attorney. Beginning December 1, 2026, the report must also include the number of unit owners who are referred to mediation by a housing counselor or attorney;

    b.
