        ii. A statement that a person with authority to agree to a resolution, including a proposed settlement, loan modification, modification of obligations related to the payment of assessments, or dismissal or continuation of the foreclosure proceeding, must be present either in person or on the telephone or videoconference during the mediation session; and

        iii. A statement that the parties have a duty to mediate in good faith and that failure to mediate in good faith may impair the beneficiary's or association's ability to foreclose on the property or the borrower's or unit owner's ability to modify the loan, modify obligations relating to the payment of assessments, or take advantage of other alternatives to foreclosure.

10. [Empty]

    a. The borrower or unit owner, the beneficiary or association or authorized agent, and the mediator must meet in person for the mediation session. However, a person with authority to agree to a resolution on behalf of the beneficiary or association may be present over the telephone or videoconference during the mediation session.

    b. After the mediation session commences, the mediator may continue the mediation session once, and any further continuances must be with the consent of the parties.

11. For deed of trust foreclosures, the participants in mediation must address the issues of foreclosure that may enable the borrower or unit owner and the beneficiary or association to reach a resolution, including but not limited to reinstatement, modification of the loan, restructuring of the debt, modification of a delinquent assessment, modification of late fees or charges associated with a delinquent assessment, or some other workout plan. To assist the parties in addressing issues of foreclosure, the mediator may require the participants to consider the following:

    a. The borrower's or unit owner's current and future economic circumstances, including the borrower's or unit owner's current and future income, debts, and obligations for the previous 60 days or greater time period as determined by the mediator;

    b. The net present value of receiving payments pursuant to a modified mortgage loan as compared to the anticipated net recovery following foreclosure;

    c. Any affordable loan modification calculation and net present value calculation when required under any federal mortgage relief program and any modification program related to loans insured by the federal housing administration, the veterans administration, and the rural housing service. If such a calculation is not provided or required, then the beneficiary must provide the net present value data inputs established by the federal deposit insurance corporation and published in the federal deposit insurance corporation loan modification program guide or other net present value data inputs as designated by the department. The mediator may run the calculation in order for a productive mediation to occur and to comply with the mediator certification requirement; and

    d. Any other loss mitigation guidelines to loans insured by the federal housing administration, the veterans administration, and the rural housing service, if applicable.

12. For association foreclosures, the participants in mediation must address the issues which led to foreclosure that may enable the unit owner and the association to reach a resolution including, but not limited to, a delinquent assessment payment plan, waiver of association imposed late fees or attorney fees, or any other workout plan.

13. A violation of the duty to mediate in good faith as required under this section may include:

    a. Failure to timely participate in mediation without good cause;

    b. Failure of the borrower , the unit owner, the beneficiary, or the association to provide the documentation required before mediation or pursuant to the mediator's instructions;

    c. Failure of a party to designate representatives with adequate authority to fully settle, compromise, or otherwise reach resolution with the borrower or unit owner in mediation;

    d. A request by a beneficiary that the borrower waive future claims he or she may have in connection with the deed of trust, as a condition of agreeing to a modification, except for rescission claims under the federal truth in lending act. Nothing in this section precludes a beneficiary or association from requesting that a borrower dismiss with prejudice any pending claims against the beneficiary, its agents, loan servicer, or trustee, arising from the underlying deed of trust, as a condition of modification; and

    e. A request by the association that the unit owner waive future claims against the association. Nothing in this section precludes an association from requesting that a unit owner dismiss any filed civil claims against the association related to the present delinquency.

14. If the mediator reasonably believes a borrower or unit owner will not attend a mediation session based on the borrower's or unit owner's conduct, such as the lack of response to the mediator's communications, the mediator may cancel a scheduled mediation session and send a written cancellation to the department and the trustee and send copies to the parties. The beneficiary or association may proceed with the foreclosure after receipt of the mediator's written confirmation of cancellation.

15. Within seven business days after the conclusion of the mediation session, the mediator must send a written certification to the department and the trustee and send copies to the parties of:

    a. The date, time, and location of the mediation session;

    b. The names of all persons attending in person and by telephone or videoconference, at the mediation session;

    d. Whether the parties participated in the mediation in good faith; and

    e. For deed of trust foreclosures, if a written agreement was not reached, a description of any net present value test used, along with a copy of the inputs, including the result of any net present value test expressed in a dollar amount.

16. If the parties are unable to reach an agreement, the beneficiary or association may proceed with the foreclosure after receipt of the mediator's written certification.

17. [Empty]

    a. The mediator's certification that the beneficiary or association failed to act in good faith in mediation constitutes a defense to the nonjudicial foreclosure action that was the basis for initiating the mediation. In any action to enjoin the foreclosure, the beneficiary or association is entitled to rebut the allegation that it failed to act in good faith.

    b. The mediator's certification that the beneficiary or association failed to act in good faith during mediation does not constitute a defense to a judicial foreclosure or a future nonjudicial foreclosure action if a modification of the loan or delinquent assessment payment plan is agreed upon and the borrower subsequently defaults or unit owner fails to pay assessments.

    c. If an affordable loan modification is not offered in the mediation or a written agreement was not reached and the mediator's certification shows that the net present value of the modified loan exceeds the anticipated net recovery at foreclosure, that showing in the certification constitutes a basis for the borrower to enjoin the foreclosure.

18. The mediator's certification that the borrower or unit owner failed to act in good faith in mediation authorizes the beneficiary or association to proceed with the foreclosure.

19. [Empty]

    a. If a borrower or unit owner has been referred to mediation before a notice of trustee sale has been recorded, a trustee may not record the notice of sale until the trustee receives the mediator's certification stating that the mediation has been completed. If the trustee does not receive the mediator's certification, the trustee may record the notice of sale after 10 days from the date the certification to the trustee was due. If, after a notice of sale is recorded under this subsection (19)(a), the mediator subsequently issues a certification finding that the beneficiary or association violated the duty of good faith, the certification constitutes a basis for the borrower or unit owner to enjoin the foreclosure.

    b. If a borrower or unit owner has been referred to mediation after the notice of sale was recorded, the sale may not occur until the trustee receives the mediator's certification stating that the mediation has been completed.

    c. If a unit owner has been referred to mediation before the filing of a judicial foreclosure, the association may not file a complaint for judicial foreclosure until the association receives the mediator's certification stating that the mediation has been completed. If the association does not receive the mediator's certification, the association may file for judicial foreclosure after 10 days from the date the certification to the association was due. If, after a judicial filing for foreclosure has been made pursuant to this subsection (19)(c), the mediator subsequently issues a certification finding that the association violated the duty of good faith, the certification constitutes a basis for the unit owner to enjoin the judicial foreclosure.

20. A mediator may charge reasonable fees as authorized by this subsection or as authorized by the department. Unless the fee is waived, the parties agree otherwise, or the department otherwise authorizes, a foreclosure mediator's fee may not exceed $400 for preparing, scheduling, and conducting a mediation session lasting between one hour and three hours. For a mediation session exceeding three hours, the foreclosure mediator may charge a reasonable fee, as authorized by the department. The mediator must provide an estimated fee before the mediation, and payment of the mediator's fee must be divided equally between the beneficiary and the borrower, or between the association and the unit owner. The beneficiary and the borrower, or the association and the unit owner, must tender the loan mediator's fee within 30 calendar days from receipt of the department's letter referring the parties to mediation or pursuant to the mediator's instructions.

21. For association foreclosures, the unit owner and the association shall be responsible for their own respective attorney fees incurred during mediation under this section.

22. Beginning December 1, 2012, and every year thereafter, the department shall report annually to the legislature on:

    a. The performance of the program, including the number of borrowers who are referred to mediation by a housing counselor or attorney. Beginning December 1, 2026, the report must also include the number of unit owners who are referred to mediation by a housing counselor or attorney;

    b.

A housing counselor who is contacted by a borrower under RCW 61.24.031 or a unit owner, has a duty to act in good faith to attempt to reach a resolution with the beneficiary on behalf of the borrower, or with the association on behalf of the unit owner, within the 90 days provided from the date the beneficiary or association initiates contact with the borrower or unit owner and the date the notice of default or notice of delinquency for past due assessments is issued. A resolution may include, but is not limited to, modification of the loan, an agreement to conduct a short sale, a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction, a delinquent assessment payment plan, or some other workout plan.

    b. Nothing in RCW 61.24.031 or this section precludes a meeting or negotiations between the housing counselor, borrower, and beneficiary at any time, including after the issuance of the notice of default. Nothing in RCW 64.90.485 or this section precludes a meeting or negotiations between the housing counselor, unit owner, and association at any time, including after the issuance of the notice of delinquency for past due assessments.

    c. A borrower who is contacted under RCW 61.24.031 or a unit owner, may seek the assistance of a housing counselor or attorney at any time.

2. Housing counselors have a duty to act in good faith to assist borrowers or unit owners by:

    a. Preparing the borrower for meetings with the beneficiary;

    b. Advising the borrower or unit owner about what documents the borrower or unit owner must have to seek a loan modification or other resolution;

    c. Informing the borrower or unit owner about the alternatives to foreclosure, including loan modifications or other possible resolutions; and

    d. Providing other guidance, advice, and education as the housing counselor considers necessary.

3. A housing counselor or attorney assisting a borrower or unit owner may refer the borrower or unit owner to mediation, pursuant to RCW 61.24.163, if the housing counselor or attorney determines that mediation is appropriate based on the individual circumstances and the borrower or unit owner has received a notice of default. The referral to mediation may be made any time after a notice of default or notice of delinquency for past due assessments has been issued but no later than 90 days prior to the date of sale listed in the notice of trustee's sale. If an amended notice of trustee's sale is recorded after the trustee sale has been stayed pursuant to RCW 61.24.130, the borrower or unit owner may be referred to mediation no later than 25 days prior to the date of sale listed in the amended notice of trustee's sale.

4. For borrowers who have received a letter under RCW 61.24.031 before June 7, 2012, a referral to mediation by a housing counselor or attorney does not preclude a trustee issuing a notice of default if the requirements of RCW 61.24.031 have been met.

5. Housing counselors providing assistance to borrowers under RCW 61.24.031 or unit owners, are not liable for civil damages resulting from any acts or omissions in providing assistance, unless the acts or omissions constitute gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct.

6. Housing counselors shall provide information to the department to assist the department in its annual report to the legislature as required under RCW 61.24.163(22).

## Section 8
For each residential mortgage loan originated, excepting only reverse mortgage loans issued to seniors over the age of 61, a foreclosure prevention fee of $80 shall be assessed and remitted at the time of closing by the escrow company processing the loan closing into the foreclosure fairness account created under RCW 61.24.172.

All receipts received under RCW 61.24.174, as it existed prior to July 1, 2016, 61.24.173,  61.24.190, and section 8 of this act must be deposited into the account. Only the director of the department of commerce or the director's designee may authorize expenditures from the account. Funding to agencies and organizations under this section must be provided by the department through an interagency agreement or other applicable contract instrument. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures.

Funds provided under  subsection (3) of this section must be used to supplement, not supplant, other federal, state, and local funds. If the program needs do not require the full use of the allocation as set forth in this section, the department may reallocate those funds to increase the percentage allocated to another agency or organization authorized to receive those funds by this section.

The department shall enter into interagency agreements to contract with the Washington state housing finance commission and other appropriate entities to implement the foreclosure fairness act.
