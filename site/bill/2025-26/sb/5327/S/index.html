<ol>
<li>
<p>As the state board of education reviews potential changes to graduation requirements, the board shall, at minimum, include in its recommendations adjustments necessary to ensure that students have adequate opportunity to demonstrate competency of the foundational skills established in the high school computer science state learning standards and state financial education learning standards.</p>

<p>In developing the recommendations, the state board of education must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Consult with students, parents and legal guardians, educators, K-12 education partners, postsecondary partners, employers, and community members; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider how to incorporate the competencies described in subsection (1) of this section into the framework of graduation requirements, including consideration of credit options and competency-based options.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>The state board of education shall, in accordance with RCW 43.01.036, report its recommendations to the governor and the education committees of the legislature by December 31, 2026.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall initiate a review and update of the state computer science learning standards for students in grades kindergarten through 12. In developing the update of the state computer science learning standards, the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall review computer science learning standards adopted by other states and consult with nonprofit organizations that have a demonstrated expertise in assisting states in developing computer science learning standards. In developing the state learning standards and supporting documents for grades nine through 12, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must identify any standards considered to be foundational for graduation purposes as established in section 1 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall initiate a review of the state financial education learning standards adopted under authority of RCW 28A.300.469 and identify any standards considered to be foundational for graduation purposes as established in section 1 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state board of education shall collect information from school districts about the courses and other learning opportunities currently offered in computer science and financial education for high school students in their district, how the district already assesses or plans to assess competency of the computer science or financial education state learning standards, and what the district may need to implement the state board of education's recommendations established under section 1 of this act. The data collection required by this subsection may be conducted concurrently with other oversight and monitoring activities conducted by the state board of education. The state board of education shall report a summary of the information collected to the legislature by December 31, 2026, and shall include any recommendations on what actions the legislature could take to assist school districts in meeting the needs identified by school districts, including whether exploring options for increasing the number of educators endorsed to teach computer science is necessary.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Include a screening for biased content in each development or revision of a state learning standard and ensure that the concepts of diversity, equity, and inclusion, as those terms are defined in RCW 28A.415.443, are incorporated into each new or revised state learning standard.

</li>
<li>
<p>Review and prioritize the state learning standards and identify, with clear and concise descriptions, the grade level content expectations to be assessed on the statewide student assessment and used for state or federal accountability purposes. The review, prioritization, and identification shall result in more focus and targeting with an emphasis on depth over breadth in the number of grade level content expectations assessed at each grade level. Grade level content expectations shall be articulated over the grades as a sequence of expectations and performances that are logical, build with increasing depth after foundational knowledge and skills are acquired, and reflect, where appropriate, the sequential nature of the discipline. The office of the superintendent of public instruction, within seven working days, shall post on its website any grade level content expectations provided to an assessment vendor for use in constructing the statewide student assessment.</p>
