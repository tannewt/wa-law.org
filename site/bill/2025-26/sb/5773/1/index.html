<li>
<p>The legislature finds that a full set of project procurement, contracting, financing, and funding tools are needed to enable the delivery of transportation projects in a manner most advantageous to the public. Current public-private partnership laws have failed to spur innovative proposals from the private sector or new project delivery approaches from the department of transportation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature confirms the findings from previous studies that current laws and administrative processes are the primary obstacle impairing the state's ability to utilize public-private partnerships. The legislature finds that a new public-private partnership law is needed to:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Transparently demonstrate and deliver better value for the public including, but not limited to, expedited project delivery and more effective management of project life-cycle costs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide an additional option for delivering complex transportation projects, including addressing a shortage of truck parking;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorporate private sector expertise and innovation into transportation project delivery;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allocate project risks to the parties best able to manage those risks;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow new sources of private capital;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="i" start="6">
<li>
<p>Increase access to federal funding and financing mechanisms;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better align private sector incentives with public priorities; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide consistency in the review and approval processes for the full range of project delivery tools and contracting methods.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that there is a need to develop other innovative approaches to deliver transportation infrastructure in a manner that maximizes value and addresses the increasing costs of project delivery. Requiring mandatory review and approval of other alternative project delivery models available to the department of transportation stifles procurement and timely project delivery. Expanded and expedited use of alternative project delivery models, like progressive design-build and general contractor/construction manager procedures, without mandatory approval or review by the capital projects advisory review board will deliver better value for the public and provide the department of transportation with more options to deliver complex transportation projects. This will also give the department of transportation the needed flexibility to adapt to changing conditions, and result in fewer delays in project delivery. Any use of such delivery models should continue to strive and adhere to disadvantaged business enterprise and small business enterprise program contract goals.</p>

Such formal request for proposals solicitation shall include a functional description of the needs and requirements of the state and the significant factors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When purchases are made through a formal request for proposals solicitation the contract shall be awarded to the responsible proposer whose competitive sealed proposal is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the state taking into consideration price and other evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals. No significant factors may be used in evaluating a proposal that are not specified in the request for proposals. Factors that may be considered in evaluating proposals include but are not limited to: Price; maintainability; reliability; commonality; performance levels; life-cycle cost if applicable under this section; cost of transportation or delivery; delivery schedule offered; installation cost; cost of spare parts; availability of parts and service offered; and the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The ability, capacity, and skill of the proposer to perform the contract or provide the service required;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience, and efficiency of the proposer;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the proposer can perform the contract within the time specified;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The quality of performance of previous contracts or services;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The previous and existing compliance by the proposer with laws relating to the contract or services;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="i" start="6">
<li>
<p>Objective, measurable criteria defined in the request for proposal. These criteria may include but are not limited to items such as discounts, delivery costs, maintenance services costs, installation costs, and transportation costs; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such other information as may be secured having a bearing on the decision to award the contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When purchases are made through a request for proposal process, proposals received shall be evaluated based on the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposal. When issuing a request for proposal for the procurement of propulsion equipment or systems that include an engine, the request for proposal must specify the use of a life-cycle cost analysis that includes an evaluation of fuel efficiency. When a life-cycle cost analysis is used, the life-cycle cost of a proposal shall be given at least the same relative importance as the initial price element specified in the request of proposal documents. The department may reject any and all proposals received. If the proposals are not rejected, the award shall be made to the proposer whose proposal is most advantageous to the department, considering price and the other evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposal.</p>

<li>
<p>The department of transportation shall develop a process for awarding competitively bid highway construction contracts for projects over $2,000,000 that may be constructed using a design-build procedure, a progressive design-build procedure, or any general contractor/construction manager procedure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As used in this section and RCW 47.20.785:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Design-build procedure&quot; means a method of contracting under which the department of transportation contracts with another party for the party to both design and build the structures, facilities, and other items specified in the contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;General contractor/construction manager procedure&quot; means a method of contracting under which the department of transportation selects a firm to provide services during the design phase, negotiate a maximum allowable construction cost, and act as construction manager and general contractor during the construction phase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Progressive design-build procedure&quot; means a method of contracting under which the department of transportation selects a design-builder before the establishment of a final project design, price, and schedule, and thereafter, the department and design-builder collaborate to develop a final project scope, schedule, and price.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process developed by the department must, at a minimum, include : The scope of services required under the design-build procedure, progressive design-build procedure, or general contractor/construction manager procedures; contractor prequalification requirements; criteria for evaluating technical information and project costs; contractor selection criteria; and issue resolution procedures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Until June 30, 2031, upon completing a delivery method selection process that identifies the progressive design-build procedure or any general contract/construction manager procedure as the preferred delivery method for a project in excess of $100,000,000, the department shall consult with the capital projects advisory review board under chapter 39.10 RCW to review the selected delivery method for the project and provide any recommendations or feedback for the department to consider. The department and the capital projects advisory review board shall collaboratively develop and implement the coordination and details of this consultation.</p>
