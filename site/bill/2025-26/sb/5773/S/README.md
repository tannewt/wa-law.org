# SB 5773 - Transportation procurement

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5773-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. [Empty]

    a. The legislature finds that a full set of project procurement, contracting, financing, and funding tools are needed to enable the delivery of transportation projects in a manner most advantageous to the public. Current public-private partnership laws have failed to spur innovative proposals from the private sector or new project delivery approaches from the department of transportation.

    b. The legislature confirms the findings from previous studies that current laws and administrative processes are the primary obstacle impairing the state's ability to utilize public-private partnerships. The legislature finds that a new public-private partnership law is needed to:

        i. Transparently demonstrate and deliver better value for the public including, but not limited to, expedited project delivery and more effective management of project life-cycle costs;

        ii. Provide an additional option for delivering complex transportation projects, including addressing a shortage of truck parking;

        iii. Incorporate private sector expertise and innovation into transportation project delivery;

        iv. Allocate project risks to the parties best able to manage those risks;

    v. Allow new sources of private capital;

    vi. Increase access to federal funding and financing mechanisms;

    vii. Better align private sector incentives with public priorities; and

    viii. Provide consistency in the review and approval processes for the full range of project delivery tools and contracting methods.

2. The legislature further finds that there is a need to develop other innovative approaches to deliver transportation infrastructure in a manner that maximizes value and addresses the increasing costs of project delivery. Requiring mandatory review and approval of other alternative project delivery models available to the department of transportation stifles procurement and timely project delivery. Expanded and expedited use of alternative project delivery models, like progressive design-build and general contractor/construction manager procedures, without mandatory approval or review by the capital projects advisory review board will deliver better value for the public and provide the department of transportation with more options to deliver complex transportation projects. This will also give the department of transportation the needed flexibility to adapt to changing conditions, and result in fewer delays in project delivery. Any use of such delivery models should continue to strive and adhere to disadvantaged business enterprise and small business enterprise program contract goals.

    a. When the secretary of the department of transportation determines in writing that the use of invitation for bid is either not practicable or not advantageous to the state and it may be necessary to make competitive evaluations, including technical or performance evaluations among acceptable proposals to complete the contract award, a contract may be entered into by use of a competitive sealed proposals method, and a formal request for proposals solicitation. Such formal request for proposals solicitation shall include a functional description of the needs and requirements of the state and the significant factors.

    b. When purchases are made through a formal request for proposals solicitation the contract shall be awarded to the responsible proposer whose competitive sealed proposal is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the state taking into consideration price and other evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals. No significant factors may be used in evaluating a proposal that are not specified in the request for proposals. Factors that may be considered in evaluating proposals include but are not limited to: Price; maintainability; reliability; commonality; performance levels; life-cycle cost if applicable under this section; cost of transportation or delivery; delivery schedule offered; installation cost; cost of spare parts; availability of parts and service offered; and the following:

        iv. The quality of performance of previous contracts or services;

    v. The previous and existing compliance by the proposer with laws relating to the contract or services;

    vi. Objective, measurable criteria defined in the request for proposal. These criteria may include but are not limited to items such as discounts, delivery costs, maintenance services costs, installation costs, and transportation costs; and

    vii. Such other information as may be secured having a bearing on the decision to award the contract.

    c. When purchases are made through a request for proposal process, proposals received shall be evaluated based on the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposal. When issuing a request for proposal for the procurement of propulsion equipment or systems that include an engine, the request for proposal must specify the use of a life-cycle cost analysis that includes an evaluation of fuel efficiency. When a life-cycle cost analysis is used, the life-cycle cost of a proposal shall be given at least the same relative importance as the initial price element specified in the request of proposal documents. The department may reject any and all proposals received. If the proposals are not rejected, the award shall be made to the proposer whose proposal is most advantageous to the department, considering price and the other evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposal.

## Section 120
No tolls may be imposed on new or existing highways or bridges without specific legislative authorization, or upon a majority vote of the people within the boundaries of the unit of government empowered to impose tolls.

2. A county, city, or town that has established a growth and transportation efficiency center program shall support vehicle trip reduction activities in the designated area. The implementing jurisdiction shall adopt policies, ordinances, and funding strategies that will lead to attainment of program goals in those areas.

## Section 201
1. The department of transportation shall develop a process for awarding competitively bid highway construction contracts for projects over $2,000,000 that may be constructed using a design-build procedure, a progressive design-build procedure, or any general contractor/construction manager procedure.

2. As used in this section and RCW 47.20.785:

    a. "Design-build procedure" means a method of contracting under which the department of transportation contracts with another party for the party to both design and build the structures, facilities, and other items specified in the contract.

    b. "General contractor/construction manager procedure" means a method of contracting under which the department of transportation selects a firm to provide services during the design phase, negotiate a maximum allowable construction cost, and act as construction manager and general contractor during the construction phase.

    c. "Progressive design-build procedure" means a method of contracting under which the department of transportation selects a design-builder before the establishment of a final project design, price, and schedule, and thereafter, the department and design-builder collaborate to develop a final project scope, schedule, and price.

3. The process developed by the department must, at a minimum, include : The scope of services required under the design-build procedure, progressive design-build procedure, or general contractor/construction manager procedures; contractor prequalification requirements; criteria for evaluating technical information and project costs; contractor selection criteria; and issue resolution procedures.

4. Until June 30, 2031, upon completing a delivery method selection process that identifies the progressive design-build procedure or any general contract/construction manager procedure as the preferred delivery method for a project in excess of $100,000,000, the department shall consult with the capital projects advisory review board under chapter 39.10 RCW to review the selected delivery method for the project and provide any recommendations or feedback for the department to consider. The department and the capital projects advisory review board shall collaboratively develop and implement the coordination and details of this consultation.

## Section 202
The department of transportation is authorized and strongly encouraged to use the design-build procedure, the progressive design-build procedure, or any general contractor/construction manager procedure for public works projects over $2,000,000 when:

1. The construction activities are highly specialized and a design-build, progressive design-build, or general contractor/construction manager approach is critical in developing the construction methodology; or

2. The projects selected provide opportunity for greater innovation and efficiencies between the designer and the builder; or

3. Significant savings in project delivery time would be realized.

## Section 203
1. A public body may apply for certification to use the design-build or general contractor/construction manager contracting procedure, or both. Once certified, a public body may use the contracting procedure for which it is certified on individual projects without seeking committee approval for a period of three years. A public body seeking certification must submit to the committee an application in a format and manner as prescribed by the committee. The application must include a description of the public body's qualifications, its capital plan during the certification period, and its intended use of alternative contracting procedures.

2. A public body seeking certification for the design-build procedure must demonstrate successful management of at least one design-build project within the previous five years. A public body seeking certification for the general contractor/construction manager procedure must demonstrate successful management of at least one general contractor/construction manager project within the previous five years.

3. To certify a public body, the committee shall determine that the public body:

    a. Has the necessary experience and qualifications to determine which projects are appropriate for using alternative contracting procedures;

    b. Has the necessary experience and qualifications to carry out the alternative contracting procedure including, but not limited to: (i) Project delivery knowledge and experience; (ii) personnel with appropriate construction experience; (iii) a management plan and rationale for its alternative public works projects; (iv) demonstrated success in managing public works projects; (v) the ability to properly manage its capital facilities plan including, but not limited to, appropriate project planning and budgeting experience; and (vi) the ability to meet requirements of this chapter; and

    c. Has resolved any audit findings on previous public works projects in a manner satisfactory to the committee.

4. The committee shall make its determination at the public meeting during which an application for certification is reviewed. Public comments must be considered before a determination is made. Within ten business days of the public meeting, the committee shall provide a written determination to the public body, and make its determination available to the public on the committee's website.

5. The committee may revoke any public body's certification upon a finding, after a public hearing, that its use of design-build or general contractor/construction manager contracting procedures no longer serves the public interest.

6. The committee may renew the certification of a public body for additional three-year periods. The public body must submit an application for recertification at least three months before the initial certification expires. The committee may accept late applications, if administratively feasible, to avoid expiration of certification on a case-by-case basis. The application shall include updated information on the public body's experience and current staffing with the procedure it is applying to renew, and any other information requested in advance by the committee. The committee must review the application for recertification at a meeting held before expiration of the applicant's initial certification period. A public body must reapply for certification under the process described in subsection (1) of this section once the period of recertification expires.

7. Certified public bodies must submit project data information as required in RCW 39.10.320 and 39.10.350.

8. The department of transportation is not subject to the certification requirements under this section to use the design-build procedure, the progressive design-build procedure, or any general contractor/construction manager contracting procedure on individual projects.

## Section 204
1. A public body not certified under RCW 39.10.270 must apply for approval from the committee to use the design-build or general contractor/construction manager contracting procedure on a project. A public body seeking approval must submit to the committee an application in a format and manner as prescribed by the committee. The application must include a description of the public body's qualifications, a description of the project, the public body's intended use of alternative contracting procedures, and, if applicable, a declaration that the public body has elected to procure the project as a heavy civil construction project.

2. To approve a proposed project, the committee shall determine that:

    a. The alternative contracting procedure will provide a substantial fiscal benefit or the use of the traditional method of awarding contracts in lump sum to the low responsive bidder is not practical for meeting desired quality standards or delivery schedules;

    b. The proposed project meets the requirements for using the alternative contracting procedure as described in RCW 39.10.300 or 39.10.340;

    c. The public body has the necessary experience or qualified team to carry out the alternative contracting procedure including, but not limited to: (i) Project delivery knowledge and experience; (ii) sufficient personnel with construction experience to administer the contract; (iii) a written management plan that shows clear and logical lines of authority; (iv) the necessary and appropriate funding and time to properly manage the job and complete the project; (v) continuity of project management team, including personnel with experience managing projects of similar scope and size to the project being proposed; and (vi) necessary and appropriate construction budget;

    d. For design-build projects, public body personnel or consultants are knowledgeable in the design-build process and are able to oversee and administer the contract; and

    e. The public body has resolved any audit findings related to previous public works projects in a manner satisfactory to the committee.

3. The committee shall, if practicable, make its determination at the public meeting during which a submittal is reviewed. Public comments must be considered before a determination is made.

4. Within 10 business days after the public meeting, the committee shall provide a written determination to the public body, and make its determination available to the public on the committee's website. If the committee fails to make a written determination within 10 business days of the public meeting, the request of the public body to use the alternative contracting procedure on the requested project shall be deemed approved.

5. Failure of the committee to meet within 60 calendar days of a public body's application to use an alternative contracting procedure on a project shall be deemed an approval of the application.

6. The department of transportation is not subject to the project approval requirements under this section.
