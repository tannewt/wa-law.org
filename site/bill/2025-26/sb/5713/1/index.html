<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In every civil, criminal, or administrative proceeding or action brought under this act, the court shall rule whether the anonymity of any patient upon whom an abortion has been performed or attempted shall be preserved from public disclosure if the patient does not consent to such disclosure. The court, upon motion or sua sponte, shall make such a ruling and, upon determining that the patient's anonymity should be preserved, shall issue orders to the parties, witnesses, and counsel and shall direct the sealing of the record and exclusion of individuals from courtrooms or hearing rooms to the extent necessary to safeguard the patient's identity from public disclosure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each such order shall be accompanied by specific written findings explaining why the anonymity of the patient should be preserved from public disclosure, why the order is essential to that end, how the order is narrowly tailored to serve that interest, and why no reasonable less restrictive alternative exists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the absence of written consent of the patient upon whom an abortion has been performed or attempted, anyone other than the public official who brings an action under this act shall do so under a pseudonym.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section may not be construed to conceal the identity of the plaintiff or of witnesses from the defendant or from attorneys for the defendant.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the remedies provided in this section, the attorney general or a district attorney with appropriate jurisdiction may request, and the court may impose, an additional civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 for each violation of section 4 of this act against any abortion pill provider, physician, physician assistant, advanced practice registered nurse, or other health care professional found by the court to have knowingly failed to conduct reasonable informed consent prior to a chemical abortion. The civil penalty shall be paid to the state to fund pregnancy resource centers that do not perform or refer for abortions.</p>

<p>For purposes of this chapter:</p>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Except in the case of a medical emergency, a chemical abortion may not be provided, performed, induced, or attempted, and an abortion-inducing drug may not be prescribed with the intent to terminate a pregnancy, unless, prior to any chemical abortion provided, performed, or attempted using any abortion-inducing drug with the intent to terminate a pregnancy, the abortion pill provider, physician, physician assistant, advanced practice registered nurse, other health care provider, or their agents shall provide written information to accompany any instructions along with a list of complications given to the patient, which must include the following statement:</li>
</ol>
<p>&quot;If you decide to take any abortion-inducing drug to end your pregnancy, the state of Washington informs you that either you or your family may hold the manufacturer, distributor, or your prescriber financially liable should you die, suffer injury or complication, or any debilitating side effects (e.g. infection, excessive bleeding, the rupture of a previously undiscovered ectopic pregnancy, etc.) from the chemical abortion. Additionally, should the manufacturer, distributor, or your prescriber fail to address side effects or if the abortion-inducing drug fails and the pregnancy continues so that you have an incomplete abortion or require surgical intervention, you may hold them financially liable. You or your family may also hold the abortion pill provider, physician, physician assistant, advanced practice registered nurse, other health care provider, or their agents financially liable for failing to inform you of complications.</p>
<p>If you experience complications and are in need of emergency care or a hospital visit, then you have the right to inform the health care provider treating the complications that you have had a chemical abortion. Providing this information will not subject you to any criminal or civil penalty and will further help save your life.&quot;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Certification of the statement in subsection (1) of this section is required. The patient shall certify in writing, prior to the chemical abortion, that the information described in subsection (1) of this section has been provided to the patient and that the patient has been informed of the opportunity to review the information referred to in subsection (1) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to performance of the chemical abortion, the abortion pill provider, physician, physician assistant, advanced practice registered nurse, other health care provider performing the chemical abortion, or their agents shall receive a copy of the written certification outlined in subsection (2) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The abortion pill provider, physician, physician assistant, advanced practice registered nurse, other health care provider, or their agents shall retain a copy of the written certification outlined in subsection (2) of this section.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The number of chemical abortions performed by the abortion pill provider, physician, physician assistant, advanced practice registered nurse, other health care provider, or their agents whereby information otherwise required to be provided before the chemical abortion was not provided because an immediate abortion was necessary to avert the patient's death or injury, along with the number of chemical abortions in which such information was not provided because a delay would create a medical emergency.</p>
