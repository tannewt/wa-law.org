"Emergency response system" includes at least one of the following:

    a. Panic or alert buttons that are tied to school administration, school district staff, and emergency response providers;

    b. Live video feed with law enforcement, school district, and school access;

    c. Live audio feed with law enforcement, school district, and school access;

    d. Remote control access to doors; or

    e. Live interactive two-way communications.

2. Each school district must submit a progress report on its implementation of an emergency response system as required under this section to the office of the superintendent of public instruction by October 1, 2025. By December 1, 2025, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must compile the information submitted by school districts and report to the legislature on the types of emergency response systems used by school districts.

3. This section governs school operation and management under RCW 28A.710.040 and 28A.715.020 and applies to charter schools established under chapter 28A.710 RCW and state-tribal education compact schools subject to chapter 28A.715 RCW.
