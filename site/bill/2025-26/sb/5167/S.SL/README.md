For the purpose of determining the amount of any state grant under this subsection, payments will include the federal portion of medicaid program supplemental payments received by the hospitals. Inpatient medicaid payments shall be established using an allowable methodology that approximates the cost of claims submitted by the hospitals. Payments made to each hospital in the program in each fiscal year of the biennium shall be compared to a baseline amount. The baseline amount will be determined by the total of (a) the inpatient claim payment amounts that would have been paid during the fiscal year had the hospital not been in the CPE program based on the reimbursement rates developed, implemented, and consistent with policies approved in the 2025-2027 biennial operating appropriations act and in effect on July 1, 2015, (b) one-half of the indigent assistance disproportionate share hospital payment amounts paid to and retained by each hospital during fiscal year 2005, and (c) all of the other disproportionate share hospital payment amounts paid to and retained by each hospital during fiscal year 2005 to the extent the same disproportionate share hospital programs exist in the 2019-2021 fiscal biennium. If payments during the fiscal year exceed the hospital's baseline amount, no additional payments will be made to the hospital except the federal portion of allowable disproportionate share hospital payments for which the hospital can certify allowable match. If payments during the fiscal year are less than the baseline amount, the hospital will be paid a state grant equal to the difference between payments during the fiscal year and the applicable baseline amount. Payment of the state grant shall be made in the applicable fiscal year and distributed in monthly payments. The grants will be recalculated and redistributed as the baseline is updated during the fiscal year. The grant payments are subject to an interim settlement within 11 months after the end of the fiscal year. A final settlement shall be performed. To the extent that either settlement determines that a hospital has received funds in excess of what it would have received as described in this subsection, the hospital must repay the excess amounts to the state when requested.

The appropriations in this section are subject to the following conditions and limitations:

Amounts in the account are provided solely for the information technology projects shown in LEAP omnibus document IT-2025, dated April 26, 2025, which is hereby incorporated by reference. To facilitate the transfer of moneys from other funds and accounts that are associated with projects contained in LEAP omnibus document IT-2025, dated April 26, 2025, the state treasurer is directed to transfer moneys from other funds and accounts to the information technology investment revolving account in accordance with schedules provided by the office of financial management. Restricted federal funds may be transferred only to the extent permitted by law, and will otherwise remain outside the information technology investment account. The projects affected remain subject to the other provisions of this section.

2. Agencies must apply to Washington technology solutions for certification and release of funding for each gate of the project. When Washington technology solutions certifies the key deliverables of the gate have been met, a current technology budget is approved and includes updated milestone deliverables with start dates and estimated completion dates for each deliverable through each stage of the entire project investment through project implementation and close out; and if applicable to the stage or gate of the project, that the project is putting functioning software into production that addresses user needs, is in compliance with the quality assurance plan, and meets a defined set of industry best practices for code quality that Washington technology solutions will post to their website by July 1, 2025, it must notify the office of financial management and the fiscal committees of the legislature. The office of financial management may not approve funding for the certified project gate any earlier than 10 business days from the date of notification to the fiscal committees of the legislature.

3. [Empty]

    a. Allocations and allotments of information technology investment revolving account must be made for discrete stages of projects as determined by the technology budget approved by Washington technology solutions and the office of financial management.

    b. Fifteen percent of total funding allocated by the office of financial management, or another amount as defined jointly by the office of financial management and Washington technology solutions, will be retained in the account, but remain allocated to that project. The retained funding will be released to the agency only after successful completion of that stage of the project and only after Washington technology solutions certifies the stage as required in subsection (2) of this section. For the one Washington project, the amount retained is increased to at least 20 percent of total funding allocated for any stage of that project. If there is no significant risk to the project, the holdback does not apply to the final gate during a biennial close.

4. [Empty]

    a. Each project must have a technology budget. The technology budget must have the detail by fiscal month for the 2025-2027 fiscal biennium. The technology budget must use a method similar to the state capital budget, identifying project costs, each fund source, and anticipated deliverables through each stage of the entire project investment and across fiscal periods and biennia from project onset through implementation and close out, as well as at least five years of maintenance and operations costs.

    b. As part of the development of a technology budget, as key milestone deliverables change that impact scope, schedule, or budget, and at each request for funding, the agency shall submit an updated technology budget, if changes occurred, to include detailed financial information to the office of financial management and Washington technology solutions. The technology budget must describe the total cost of the project, as well as maintenance and operations costs, to include and identify at least:

        i. Fund sources:

(A) If the project is funded from the information technology revolving account, the technology budget must include a worksheet that provides the fund sources that were transferred into the account by fiscal year;

(B) If the project managed is by a central service agency, and funds are driven out by the central service model, the technology budget must provide a statewide impact by agency by fund as a worksheet in the technology budget file;

        ii. Full time equivalent staffing level to include job classification assumptions. This is to assure that the project has adequate state staffing and agency support to ensure success, ensure user acceptance, and adequately test the functionality being delivered in each sprint before it is accepted by the agency's contracting officer or their representative. Key project functions that are deemed "critical" must be retained by state personnel and not outsourced, to ensure that knowledge is retained within state government and that the state can self-sufficiently support the system and make improvements without long-term dependence on a vendor;

        iii. Discrete financial budget codes to include at least the appropriation index and program index. If the subproject or project is appropriated funding at more than one agency, as is done with the statewide electronic health records solution where federal funding is appropriated to the health care authority, then:

(A) The project technology budget and each impacted agency that receives appropriated funding must use the same program index across each agency;

(B) Each appropriation index from each impacted agency must be identified on the technology budget input page; and

(C) The technology budget must be compiled in the lead agency technology budget only, referencing any differences in appropriation index, as described in (b)(iii)(B) of this subsection;

        iv. Object and subobject codes of expenditures;

    v. Anticipated deliverables that must include a start date and estimated completion date for each deliverable to include, but not limited to, requests for proposals release dates, go-live dates, and software demonstration dates;

    vi. Historical budget and expenditure detail by fiscal year; and

    vii. Maintenance and operations costs by fiscal year for at least five years as a separate worksheet.

    c. If a project technology budget changes and once a revised technology budget is completed, a comparison of the revised technology budget to the last approved technology budget must be posted to the dashboard, to include a narrative rationale on what changed, why, and how the changes impact the project scope, budget, and schedule.

5. [Empty]

    a. Each project must have a project charter. The charter must include:

        i. An organizational chart of the project management team that identifies team members and their roles and responsibilities, and shows that the project is adequately staffed by state personnel in key functions to ensure success;

        ii. The Washington technology solutions staff assigned to the project;

        iii. A project roadmap that includes the problems the team is solving and the sequence in which the team intends to take on those problems, updated periodically to reflect what has been learned;

        iv. Metrics to support the project strategy and vision, to determine that the project is incrementally meeting user needs;

    v. An implementation schedule covering activities, critical milestones, and deliverables at each stage of the project for the life of the project at each agency affected by the project;

    vi. Performance measures used to determine that the project is on time, within budget, and meeting expectations for quality of work product;

    vii. Ongoing maintenance and operations cost of the project post implementation and close out delineated by agency staffing, contracted staffing, and service level agreements; and

    viii. Financial budget coding to include at least discrete financial coding for the project.

    b. If required by Washington technology solutions, a project may also need to have an investment plan. Washington technology solutions must:

        i. Base the requirement of an agency needing to have an investment plan on the complexity and risk of the project;

        ii. Establish requirements by project risk level in statewide technology policy, and publish the requirements by September 30, 2025; and

        iii. In collaboration with the department of enterprise services, define the circumstances under which the vendor will be terminated or replaced and establish the process by which the agency will transition to a new vendor with a minimal reduction in project productivity.

6. [Empty]

    a. Projects with estimated costs greater than $100,000,000 from initiation to completion and implementation may be divided into discrete subprojects as determined by Washington technology solutions, except for the one Washington project which must be divided into the following discrete subprojects: Core financials, expanding financials and procurement, budget, and human resources. Each subproject must have a technology budget as provided in this section.

    b. If the project affects more than one agency:

        i. A separate technology budget and investment plan must be prepared by each agency; and

        ii. There must be a budget roll up that includes each affected agency at the subproject level.

7. Washington technology solutions shall maintain a statewide information technology project dashboard that provides updated information each fiscal month on projects subject to this section. The statewide dashboard must meet the requirements in section 156 of this act.

8. For any project that exceeds $2,000,000 in total funds to complete, requires more than one biennium to complete, or is financed through financial contracts, bonds, or other indebtedness:

    a. Independent quality assurance services for the project must report independently to Washington technology solutions;

    b. Washington technology solutions, based on project risk assessments, may require additional quality assurance services and independent verification and validation services;

    c. Washington technology solutions must review, and, if necessary, revise the proposed project to ensure it is flexible and adaptable to advances in technology;

    d. The technology budget must specifically identify the uses of any financing proceeds. No more than thirty percent of the financing proceeds may be used for payroll-related costs for state employees assigned to project management, installation, testing, or training;

    e. The agency must consult with the office of the state treasurer during the competitive procurement process to evaluate early in the process whether products and services to be solicited and the responsive bids from a solicitation may be financed;

    f. The agency must consult with the contracting division of the department of enterprise services for a review of all contracts and agreements related to the project's information technology procurements;

    g. The agency and project must use an agile development model holding live demonstrations of functioning software, developed using incremental user research, held at the end of every two-week sprint, except for:

        i. Hardware or infrastructure projects; and

        ii. Projects that have implemented all phases and are now in maintenance and operations;

    h. The project solution must be capable of being continually updated, as necessary; and

        i. The agency and project must deploy usable functionality into production for users within 180 days from the date of an executed procurement contract in response to a competitive request for proposal.

9. Washington technology solutions must evaluate the project at each stage and certify whether the project is putting functioning software into production that addresses user needs, is projected to be completed within budget, is in compliance with the quality assurance plan, and meets a defined set of industry best practices for code quality, and whether the project is planned, managed, meeting deliverable targets as defined in the project's approved technology budget and investment plan, and that the current technology budget reflects updated scope, schedule, and budget to include updated milestone deliverables with start dates and estimated completion dates through each stage of the entire project investment through project implementation and close out.

10. Washington technology solutions may suspend or terminate a project at any time if it determines that the project is not meeting or not expected to meet anticipated performance and technology outcomes. Once suspension or termination occurs, the agency shall unallot any unused funding and shall not make any expenditure for the project without the approval of the office of financial management. Washington technology solutions must report on December 1 each calendar year any suspension or termination of a project in the previous 12-month period to the legislative fiscal committees.

11. Washington technology solutions, in consultation with the office of financial management, may identify additional projects to be subject to this section, including projects that are not separately identified within an agency budget. Washington technology solutions must report on December 1 each calendar year any additional projects to be subjected to this section that were identified in the previous 12-month period to the legislative fiscal committees.

12. Any cost to administer or implement this section for projects listed in subsection (1) of this section, must be paid from the information technology investment revolving account. For any other information technology project subject to the conditions, limitations, and review of this section, the cost to implement this section must be paid from the funds for that project.

## Section 971
1. The department is authorized to take one or more of the actions listed in subsection (2) of this section in any case in which the department finds that an adult family home provider has:

    a. Failed or refused to comply with the requirements of this chapter or the rules adopted under this chapter;

    b. Operated an adult family home without a license or under a revoked license;

    c. Knowingly or with reason to know made a false statement of material fact on his or her application for license or any data attached thereto, or in any matter under investigation by the department; or

    d. Willfully prevented or interfered with any inspection or investigation by the department.

2. When authorized by subsection (1) of this section, the department may take one or more of the following actions:

    a. Refuse to issue a license;

    b. Impose reasonable conditions on a license, such as correction within a specified time, training, and limits on the type of clients the provider may admit or serve;

    c. Impose civil penalties of at least one hundred dollars per day per violation;

    d. Impose civil penalties of up to three thousand dollars for each incident that violates adult family home licensing laws and rules, including, but not limited to, chapters 70.128, 70.129, 74.34, and 74.39A RCW and related rules. Each day upon which the same or substantially similar action occurs is a separate violation subject to the assessment of a separate penalty;

    e. Impose civil penalties of up to ten thousand dollars for a current or former licensed provider who is operating an unlicensed home;

    f. Suspend, revoke, or refuse to renew a license; or

    g. Suspend admissions to the adult family home by imposing stop placement.

3. When the department orders stop placement, the facility shall not admit any person until the stop placement order is terminated. The department may approve readmission of a resident to the facility from a hospital or nursing home during the stop placement. The department shall terminate the stop placement only after: (a) The violations necessitating the stop placement have been corrected; and (b) the provider exhibits the capacity to maintain correction of the violations previously found deficient. However, if upon the revisit the department finds new violations that the department reasonably believes will result in a new stop placement, the previous stop placement shall remain in effect until the new stop placement is imposed. In order to protect the home's existing residents from potential ongoing neglect, when the provider has been cited for a violation that is repeated, uncorrected, pervasive, or presents a threat to the health, safety, or welfare of one or more residents, and the department has imposed a stop placement, the department shall also impose a condition on license or other remedy to facilitate or spur prompter compliance if the violation has not been corrected, and the provider has not exhibited the capacity to maintain correction, within sixty days of the stop placement.

4. Nothing in subsection (3) of this section is intended to apply to stop placement imposed in conjunction with a license revocation or summary suspension or to prevent the department from imposing a condition on license or other remedy prior to sixty days after a stop placement, if the department considers it necessary to protect one or more residents' well-being. After a department finding of a violation for which a stop placement has been imposed, the department shall make an on-site revisit of the provider within fifteen working days from the request for revisit, to ensure correction of the violation. For violations that are serious or recurring or uncorrected following a previous citation, and create actual or threatened harm to one or more residents' well-being, including violations of residents' rights, the department shall make an on-site revisit as soon as appropriate to ensure correction of the violation. Verification of correction of all other violations may be made by either a department on-site revisit or by written or photographic documentation found by the department to be credible. This subsection does not prevent the department from enforcing license suspensions or revocations. Nothing in this subsection shall interfere with or diminish the department's authority and duty to ensure that the provider adequately cares for residents, including to make departmental on-site revisits as needed to ensure that the provider protects residents, and to enforce compliance with this chapter.

5. Chapter 34.05 RCW applies to department actions under this section, except that orders of the department imposing license suspension, stop placement, or conditions for continuation of a license are effective immediately upon notice and shall continue in effect pending a hearing, which must commence no later than sixty days after receipt of a request for a hearing. The time for commencement of a hearing may be extended by agreement of the parties or by the presiding officer for good cause shown by either party, but must commence no later than one hundred twenty days after receipt of a request for a hearing.

6. A separate adult family home account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. All receipts from civil penalties imposed under this chapter must be deposited into the account. Only the director or the director's designee may authorize expenditures from the account. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures. The department shall use the special account only for promoting the quality of life and care of residents living in adult family homes. During the 2025-2027 fiscal biennium, the account may be expended for funding costs associated with the adult family home program.

7. The department shall by rule specify criteria as to when and how the sanctions specified in this section must be applied. The criteria must provide for the imposition of incrementally more severe penalties for deficiencies that are repeated, uncorrected, pervasive, or present a threat to the health, safety, or welfare of one or more residents. The criteria shall be tiered such that those homes consistently found to have deficiencies will be subjected to increasingly severe penalties. The department shall implement prompt and specific enforcement remedies without delay for providers found to have delivered care or failed to deliver care resulting in problems that are repeated, uncorrected, pervasive, or present a threat to the health, safety, or welfare of one or more residents. In the selection of remedies, the health, safety, and well-being of residents must be of paramount importance.
