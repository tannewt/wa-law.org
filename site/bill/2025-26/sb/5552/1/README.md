# SB 5552 - Kit homes/building codes

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5552.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that the price of introductory housing has become unaffordable for homebuyers of modest means.  As a result, the legislature intends to create the kit home category of building codes to provide for a small home that is affordable for more homebuyers.

## Section 2
As used in this chapter:

## Section 3
1. The state building code council is instructed to perform rule making on the state building codes applicable to kit homes no later than December 31, 2025. These codes must not impose costs greater than $150 per square foot to the original home buyer.

2. The state building code council may update the state building codes applicable to kit homes. However, any updates must not impose costs to kit home construction exceeding $150 per square foot, adjusted by the consumer price index.

## Section 4
This act is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, or support of the state government and its existing public institutions, and takes effect immediately.
