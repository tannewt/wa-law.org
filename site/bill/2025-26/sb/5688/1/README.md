[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5688.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that it is incumbent upon the state of Washington to protect Washingtonians from unconstitutional federal and state actions. The legislature also finds that federal executive orders that are unconstitutional and violate legal precedents or standards should not be followed. The legislature, therefore, intends to ensure no official or employee of the state or its political subdivisions will be required or authorized to act in violation of the United States Constitution or Washington Constitution, and that the state will seek to recover any costs associated with fighting for the rights of the citizens of Washington.

## Section 2
No state or local official or employee, agent of the state of Washington or its political subdivisions, employee of a corporation providing services for the state of Washington, or member of the national guard or state defense forces acting in his or her capacity as a state or local official or employee, is required or authorized to act in an official capacity to follow any federal executive order which does not comply with the United States Constitution, the Washington Constitution, or judicial precedents or standards.

## Section 3
Any state or local agency, including law enforcement and emergency services agencies, that incurs costs as a result of protecting the rights of citizens under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution to protest any federal executive order which does not comply with the United States Constitution, the Washington Constitution, or judicial precedents or standards may submit an invoice to the United States department of the treasury allocating those costs and seeking reimbursement.

## Section 4
This act may be known and cited as the Washington sovereignty act.

## Section 5
This act is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, or support of the state government and its existing public institutions, and takes effect immediately.
