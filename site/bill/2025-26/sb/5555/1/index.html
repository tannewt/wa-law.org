<li>
<p>Prohibit the addition of housing units in any specific part of a building except ground floor commercial or retail that is along a major pedestrian corridor as defined by each city, except as provided in section 1 of this act, unless the addition of the units would violate applicable building codes or health and safety standards;</p>

<li>

<li>
<p>Deny a building permit application for the addition of housing units within an existing building due to nonconformity regarding parking, height, setbacks, elevator size for gurney transport, or modulation, unless the city official with decision-making authority makes written findings that the nonconformity is causing a significant detriment to the surrounding area; or</p>
