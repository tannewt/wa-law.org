        iii. Transfer hearings under this subsection (2)(c) shall take into account the person's engagement in programming, treatment needs, goals, future plans, length of confinement, classification, current behavior, mental and emotional health, and any disabilities or special needs impacting the safety or suitability of transferring the person to the department of corrections, be minimally disruptive, and ensure a person has at least seven calendar days' notice to prepare for the hearing.

3. The department of corrections must retain authority over custody decisions relating to a person whose earned release date is on or after the person's 25th birthday and who is placed in a facility operated by the department of children, youth, and families under this section, unless the person qualifies for partial confinement under RCW 72.01.412, and must approve any leave from the facility.

    b. A person who is transferred to the custody of the department of corrections and reaches 18 years of age may remain in a housing unit for persons under the age of 18 if the secretary of corrections determines that: (i) The person's needs and the rehabilitation goals for the person could continue to be better met by the programs and housing environment that is separate from other persons in custody who are 18 years of age and older; and (ii) the programs or housing environment for persons under the age of 18 will not be substantially affected by the continued placement of the person in that environment. The person may remain placed in a housing unit for persons under the age of 18 until such time as the secretary of corrections determines that the person's needs and goals are no longer better met in that environment but in no case past the person's 25th birthday.

    c. A person transferred to the custody of the department of corrections who is under the age of 18 may be housed in an intensive management unit or administrative segregation unit containing offenders 18 years of age or older if it is necessary for the safety or security of the offender or staff.

5. The department of children, youth, and families must review the placement of a person over age 21 in the custody of the department of children, youth, and families under this section to provide information to the person regarding voluntary transfer to the custody of the department of corrections.

The department of children, youth, and families may determine the frequency of the review required under this subsection, but the review must occur at least once before the person reaches age 23 if the person's commitment period in a juvenile institution extends beyond the person's 25th birthday.

    b. At the review required under this subsection, the department of children, youth, and families and the department of corrections shall provide information in writing to the person on all available placement options and availability of those options at the department of corrections, and the person's specific eligibility for those placement options based on their classification and custody level determination made by the department of corrections in writing prior to any voluntary transfer decision. The person shall be provided an opportunity to consult with counsel during the review to confirm that the person is making a knowing, voluntary, and fully informed request.

    c. A person who, after the review, requests to be transferred to the department of corrections, shall be transferred directly into the placement agreed upon by the secretary of the department of children, youth, and families and the secretary of the department of corrections. A person who has been transferred to the department of corrections under this section may request to be transferred and returned to the custody of the department of children, youth, and families one time within 12 months after transferring, provided the in-residence population of the juvenile rehabilitation institution is below 100 percent rated bed capacity at the time the department of children, youth, and families receives the request. If the in-residence population of the juvenile rehabilitation institution exceeds 100 percent rated bed capacity at the time the department of children, youth, and families receives the person's request, the request shall be placed on hold until the in-residence population returns below 100 percent rated bed capacity, at which time the department of children, youth, and families shall process the transfer request with the coordination of the department of corrections.

    d. The hearing requirements of RCW 13.40.280 do not apply to persons transferred under this subsection.

2. The secretary of the department of children, youth, and families may, with the consent of the secretary of the department of corrections, transfer a juvenile offender to the department of corrections if it is established at a hearing before a review board that continued placement of the juvenile offender in an institution for juvenile offenders presents a continuing and serious threat to the safety of others in the institution. The department of children, youth, and families shall establish rules for the conduct of the hearing, including provision of counsel for the juvenile offender.

3. The secretary of the department shall establish rules for defining and developing an internal behavioral management infraction system and procedures to respond to a continuing and serious threat to the safety of others in the institution under this section. The rules shall provide guidance on when the following circumstances present a continuing and serious threat and warrant imposing a disciplinary infraction by the department: Any assault involving serious bodily harm and possession of any contraband that puts the safety of others or the security of the institution at risk. The department shall also establish a rule setting the amount of time for when the board must hold a hearing. The board shall determine whether the accused juvenile offender represents a continuing and serious threat to the safety of others in the institution.

4.
