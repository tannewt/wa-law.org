# SB 5278 - Juvenile correctional pop.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5278.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that the youth of Washington state are among its most valuable resources and that the principles enumerated in RCW 13.40.010 are reaffirmed. Overcrowding, violence, and increases in juvenile crime are preventing institutions from carrying out the rehabilitation of youthful offenders.

Furthermore, the legislature recognizes the need for the department to safely manage the populations of its institutions and protect both youth in its care and state employees. The state of Washington remains firmly committed to the principles of rehabilitation and punishing offenders for the harms they commit against victims and the public.

## Section 2
The department shall promulgate rules establishing the safe operational capacity of all juvenile correctional institutions and community facilities under its control. The department shall revise those rules as necessary.

## Section 3
1. [Empty]

    a. When the secretary concludes that the in-residence population of any secure juvenile correctional institution exceeds 105 percent of the rated bed capacity, the secretary may transfer a sufficient number of offenders from the secure institution to community facilities to reduce the in-residence population at the secure institution to 100 percent of rated bed capacity.

    v. An offender with a history of infractions at an institution and who would be unable to comply with residential disciplinary standards established by the department.

    c. When placing an offender at a community facility under this section, the secretary shall comply with RCW 72.05.420, except the requirements of RCW 72.05.420(1)(b) may be waived.

2. [Empty]

    a. When the secretary concludes that the in-residence population of any secure juvenile correctional institution exceeds 105 percent of the rated bed capacity and the rehabilitative goals of the institution cannot be met, the secretary shall, with consent of the secretary of the department of corrections, transfer a sufficient number of offenders from the secure institution to the department of corrections to reduce the in-residence population of the secure institution to 100 percent of rated bed capacity.

    b. The following offenders shall be transferred:

    e. The severity of any offense committed;

    f. Whether the person's transfer to the department of corrections will affect the rehabilitative goals of the person; and

    g. Any other information necessary.

2. This section does not create any legal rights.

3. The secretary of the department of children, youth, and families and the secretary of the department of corrections shall develop a form for a person to make a transfer request.

## Section 5

The department of corrections shall determine the person's earned release date.

    a. While in the custody of the department of children, youth, and families, the person must have the same treatment, housing options, transfer, and access to program resources as any other person committed to that juvenile correctional facility or institution pursuant to chapter 13.40 RCW. Except as provided under (d) of this subsection, treatment, placement, and program decisions shall be at the sole discretion of the department of children, youth, and families. Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, the person shall not be transferred to the custody of the department of corrections without the approval of the department of children, youth, and families until the person reaches the age of 25.

    c. If the department of children, youth, and families determines that retaining custody of the person in a facility of the department of children, youth, and families presents a significant safety risk, the department of children, youth, and families may transfer the person to the custody of the department of corrections. Pursuant to subsection (4) of this section, any assault or serious bodily harm to staff or inappropriate sexual relations between a staff person and a person in the custody of the department of children, youth, and families shall be deemed to be a significant safety risk.

    d. The department of corrections must retain authority over custody decisions relating to a person whose earned release date is on or after the person's 25th birthday and who is placed in a facility operated by the department of children, youth, and families under this section, unless the person qualifies for partial confinement under RCW 72.01.412, and must approve any leave from the facility.

A person transferred to the custody of the department of corrections who is under the age of 18 may be housed in an intensive management unit or administrative segregation unit containing offenders 18 years of age or older if it is necessary for the safety or security of the offender or staff. In these cases, the offender must be kept physically separate from other offenders at all times.

3. The department of children, youth, and families must review the placement of a person over age 21 in the custody of the department of children, youth, and families under this section to determine whether the person should be transferred to the custody of the department of corrections. The department of children, youth, and families may determine the frequency of the review required under this subsection, but the review must occur at least once before the person reaches age 23 if the person's commitment period in a juvenile institution extends beyond the person's 23rd birthday.
