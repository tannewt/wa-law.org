<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature acknowledges that positive youth development programs provide important wraparound services that complement and fill gaps in the state's public school system. These programs provide a safe place for young people to go outside of school, especially for families with parents or guardians working full time.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that positive youth development programs help increase school attendance and prevent system involvement, such as interaction with the juvenile justice system. Additionally, these programs provide alternatives for young people spending time on screens and in isolation, and they can help with career navigation and workforce readiness.</p>
<p>The legislature intends to incentivize philanthropic investment in youth development programs through public-private partnerships by creating an account to centralize future investments and increase fiscal transparency and visibility. This youth development fund account will work towards making sure all young people have access to these positive programs regardless of socio-economic status and where they live in the state.</p>
