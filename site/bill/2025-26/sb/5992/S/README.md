# SB 5992 - Youth development fund

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5992-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature acknowledges that positive youth development programs provide important wraparound services that complement and fill gaps in the state's public school system. These programs provide a safe place for young people to go outside of school, especially for families with parents or guardians working full time.

2. The legislature finds that positive youth development programs help increase school attendance and prevent system involvement, such as interaction with the juvenile justice system. Additionally, these programs provide alternatives for young people spending time on screens and in isolation, and they can help with career navigation and workforce readiness.

3. The legislature recognizes the importance of and intends to have tribes operate their own youth development and prevention efforts, including using culturally grounded and community-wide approaches.

4. The legislature intends to incentivize philanthropic investment in youth development programs through public-private partnerships by creating an account to centralize future investments and increase fiscal transparency and visibility. This youth development fund account will work towards making sure all young people have access to these positive programs regardless of socio-economic status and where they live in the state.

## Section 2
1. [Empty]

    a. The superintendent of public instruction or the superintendent's designee may distribute grants from the youth development fund account created in section 3 of this act to nonprofit entities, entities sponsored by a nonprofit organization, federally recognized Indian tribes, including federally recognized Indian tribes whose traditional lands and territories included parts of Washington, but that now reside in Oregon, Idaho, and British Columbia, and city or county parks and recreation entities to support youth development programs. School districts and educational service districts may be eligible to apply for grants only when they are partnering with community-based organizations or when no such nonprofit programs exist in their location.

    b. Youth development programs may include, but are not limited to, programs that provide:

        i. Learning acceleration;

        ii. Social-emotional learning;

        iii. Mentorship;

        iv. Connection to relevant resources outside of schools;

    v. Support related to postsecondary access and career pathways;

    vi. Arts, STEM, as defined in RCW 28A.188.010, and sports-based programming;

    vii. Outdoor education;

    viii. Youth civic engagement; or

        ix. Cultural programming.

    c. When authorizing these expenditures, the superintendent of public instruction must prioritize:

        i. Geographic distribution of grant funding in an equitable manner throughout all nine educational service district regions of the state giving priority to geographies where young people have the least access to youth development opportunities based on available data; and

        ii. Supporting youth from groups that have historically not met academic standards, are more at risk of dropout, and have lower than average graduation rates; youth in foster care; youth experiencing homelessness; youth living in poverty; and American Indian and Alaska Native students.

2. In accordance with the requirements in subsection (3) of this section, any entity receiving grants must annually report the impacts of this funding to the office of the superintendent of public instruction.

3. The office of Native education within the office of the superintendent of public instruction under RCW 28A.300.105 must engage in consultations with federally recognized tribes when the office of the superintendent of public instruction designs and administers grants that affect tribal applicants or recipients, including any reporting requirements which must respect tribal data sovereignty and community-defined measures of success.

4. For purposes of this section, "youth development program" means a program that serves youth between the ages of five to 24 and focuses on holistic outcomes by complementing school-day academics. A "youth development program" may include mentoring, expanded learning opportunities, after school or summer programs, school-aged child care, or other child supports that address the comprehensive needs of young people.

## Section 3
1. The youth development fund account is created in the custody of the state treasurer.

2. Only the superintendent of public instruction or the superintendent's designee may authorize expenditures from the account. Expenditures from the account may be used only for youth development programs in accordance with section 2 of this act.

3. The account is subject to the allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures.
