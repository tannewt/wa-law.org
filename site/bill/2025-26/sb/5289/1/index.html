<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, if a single transaction involves services that are not exempt under this section and services that would be exempt under this section if provided separately, the exemptions provided in subsection (1) (c) and (d) of this section apply if: (i) The seller makes a separately itemized charge for labor and services described in subsection (1) (c) or (d) of this section; and (ii) the separately itemized charge does not exceed the seller's usual and customary charge for such services.</p>

<p>(A) The eligible farmer having gross sales or a harvested value of agricultural products grown, raised, or produced by that person or gross sales of bee pollination services of at least ten thousand dollars in the first full tax year in which the person engages in business as a farmer; or</p>

<pre><code>    ii. If a person fails to meet the condition provided in (b)(i)(A) or (B) of this subsection, the person must repay any taxes exempted under this section. Any taxes for which an exemption under this section was claimed are due and payable to the department within thirty days of the end of the first full tax year in which the person engages in business as a farmer. The department must assess interest on the taxes for which the exemption was claimed as provided in chapter 82.32 RCW, retroactively to the date the exemption was claimed, and accrues until the taxes for which the exemption was claimed are paid. Penalties may not be imposed on any tax required to be paid under this subsection (3)(b)(ii) if full payment is received by the due date.

As part of the application, the eligible farmer must provide invoices for purchases of farm machinery and equipment qualifying for a remittance under this section.
