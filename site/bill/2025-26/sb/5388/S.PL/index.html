<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that in 2020, the governor signed Second Substitute Senate Bill No. 6211 into law, which made various changes to the drug offender sentencing alternative statutes. As part of that legislation, revisions were made to RCW 9.94A.662 to state that substance use disorder treatment services provided in prisons be licensed by the department of health.</p>
<p>As a result, under RCW 71.24.037, the department of health is also required to license mental health services provided in prisons.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that prior to the passing of Second Substitute Senate Bill No. 6211 in 2020, the department of social and health services created the department of corrections substance use disorder treatment services in collaboration with the department of corrections.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to require the department of health to monitor the provision of behavioral health services to individuals in correctional facilities based on standards jointly established by the department of health and the department of corrections. Monitoring shall be done in lieu of licensure by the department of health.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
