<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The state is in the midst of a housing affordability crisis. Homes cannot be built fast enough to meet the urgent need to keep families, seniors, and all Washington renters housed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Residential rents and manufactured/mobile home lot rents have increased at a rate that outpaces inflation, wage growth, cost of living adjustments for programs like social security, and other standard economic metrics that drive price increases. In October 2024, the United States census bureau reported that 15 percent of renter households in Washington received a rent increase of over $250 ($3,000 per year). The United States census bureau also reported that Black households received higher rent increases than other racial groups and that almost a quarter of Black renters received rent increases of over $250 per month. In addition, 57 percent of renter households with children under the age of 18 received a rent increase of over $100, while 22 percent received rent increases of over $250.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tenants in residential and manufactured/mobile home settings are subject to not only excessive rent increases, but also to the addition of new recurring or periodic fees that can have the effect of drastically increasing monthly housing costs. Tenants also experience arbitrary one-time fees or the addition of fees for services that were previously provided at no cost. Combined with rent increases, these fees create significant additional financial strains for renter households.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the 2021 American community survey, nearly one out of every four renters in the state of Washington is over the age of 55. Households of color are disproportionately renters, and these households, as well as Hispanic households, are majority renter households.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excessive rent increases force renter households, including families, seniors, and young people, to lose housing opportunities. Due to excessive rent increases, renter households are increasingly unable to afford housing in communities of opportunity and are being forced to move away from their communities. Renter households are forced to make tough and often impossible decisions between paying the rent and paying for other basic necessities such as medicine, child care, and transportation. Communities, employers, and workers all suffer when businesses cannot retain or hire staff because workers have to move due to excessive rent increases, a phenomenon especially common for the service industry in heavy tourism areas.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature declares that failure to act urgently to protect Washingtonians from excessive rent increases will result in continued harm for millions of residents, especially when considering the essential nature of housing. Therefore, the legislature intends to enact rent stabilization policies in order to preserve the public peace, health, or safety of the state by providing Washington renters with predictability, transparency, and the same protections afforded to other consumers.</p>

<p>The annual notice of rent increase requirement in this section does not apply if the rental agreement governs a subsidized tenancy where the amount of rent is based on, in whole or in part, a percentage of the income of the tenant or other circumstances specific to the subsidized household. However, for purposes of this section, a subsidized tenancy does not include tenancies where some or all of the rent paid to the landlord comes from a portable tenant-based voucher or similar portable assistance administered through a housing authority or other state or local agency, or tenancies in other types of affordable housing where maximum unit rents are limited by area median income levels and a tenant's base rent does not change as the tenant's income does.</p>

<p>&quot;TO TENANT(S): (tenant name(s))</p>
<p>AT ADDRESS: (tenant address)</p>
<p>RENT AND FEE INCREASE NOTICE TO TENANTS</p>
<p>This notice is required by Washington state law to inform you of your rights regarding rent and fee increases. Washington state limits how much your landlord can raise your rent and fees.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Your landlord can raise your rent and fees combined once every 12 months by up to seven percent, as allowed by section 101 of this act. Your landlord is not required to raise the rent or fees by any amount.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your landlord may be exempt from the seven percent limit on rent and fee increases for the reasons described in section 102 of this act. If your landlord claims an exemption, your landlord is required to include supporting facts with this notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your landlord must properly and fully complete the form below to notify you of any rent and fee increases and any exemptions claimed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Your landlord (name) intends to (check one of the following):</p>
<p>__ Raise your rent and/or fees: Your total rent and fee increase effective (date) will be (percent), which totals an additional $(dollar amount) per month, for a new total amount of $(dollar amount) per month for rent and fees combined.</p>
<p>This rent and/or fee increase is allowed by state law and is (check one of the following):</p>
<p>__ A lower rent and/or fee increase than the maximum allowed by state law.</p>
<p>__ The maximum rent and/or fee increase allowed by state law.</p>
<p>__ Authorized by an exemption under section 102 of this act. If the rent and/or fee increase is authorized by an exemption, your landlord must fill out the section of the form below.</p>
<p>EXEMPTIONS CLAIMED BY LANDLORD</p>
<p>Under penalty of perjury, I (landlord name) certify that I am allowed under Washington state law to raise your rent and fees by (percent), which is more than the maximum increase otherwise allowed by state law, because I am claiming the following exemption under section 102 of this act (check one of the following):</p>
<p>__ The first certificate of occupancy for your dwelling unit was issued on (insert date), which is 10 or less years before the date of this rent and fee increase notice, so the maximum allowable rent and fee increase limit in section 101 of this act does not apply. (The landlord must include facts or attach documents supporting the exemption.)</p>
<p>__ You live in a dwelling unit owned by a public housing authority, public development authority, or nonprofit organization where maximum rents are regulated by other laws or local, state, or federal affordable housing program requirements, or a qualified low-income housing development as defined in RCW 82.45.010, where the property is owned by a public housing authority, public development authority, or nonprofit organization. (The landlord must include facts or attach documents supporting the exemption.)</p>
<p>__ You live in a dwelling unit in which you share a bathroom or kitchen facility with the owner, and the owner maintains a principal residence at the residential real property. (The landlord must include facts or attach documents supporting the exemption.)</p>
<p>__ You live in a single-family owner-occupied residence in which the owner-occupant rents or leases no more than two units or bedrooms including, but not limited to, an attached or detached accessory dwelling unit. (The landlord must include facts or attach documents supporting the exemption.)</p>
<p>__ You live in a duplex in which the owner occupied one of the units as the owner's principal place of residence at the beginning of the tenancy, and the owner continues in occupancy. (The landlord must include facts or attach documents supporting the exemption.)&quot;</p>
<h2 id="section-104">Section 104 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-104">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the practices covered by section 101 of this act, section 102 of this act, section 103 of this act, RCW 59.18.140, 59.18.170, 59.18.200, 59.18.270, and 59.18.650 are matters vitally affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW. A violation of section 101 of this act, section 102 of this act, section 103 of this act, RCW 59.18.140, 59.18.170, 59.18.200, 59.18.270, or 59.18.650 by a landlord is not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business and is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce and an unfair method of competition for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW.</p>

<p>All moneys paid to the landlord by the tenant as a deposit as security for performance of the tenant's obligations in a lease or rental agreement shall promptly be deposited by the landlord in a trust account, maintained by the landlord for the purpose of holding such security deposits for tenants of the landlord, in a financial institution as defined by RCW 30A.22.041 or licensed escrow agent located in Washington. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the landlord shall be entitled to receipt of interest paid on such trust account deposits. The landlord shall provide the tenant with a written receipt for the deposit and shall provide written notice of the name and address and location of the depository and any subsequent change thereof. If during a tenancy the status of landlord is transferred to another, any sums in the deposit trust account affected by such transfer shall simultaneously be transferred to an equivalent trust account of the successor landlord, and the successor landlord shall promptly notify the tenant of the transfer and of the name, address, and location of the new depository. If, during the tenancy, the tenant's dwelling unit is foreclosed upon and the tenant's deposit is not transferred to the successor after the foreclosure sale or other transfer of the property from the foreclosed-upon owner to a successor, the foreclosed-upon owner shall promptly refund the full deposit to the tenant immediately after the foreclosure sale or transfer. If the foreclosed-upon owner does not either immediately refund the full deposit to the tenant or transfer the deposit to the successor, the foreclosed-upon owner is liable to the tenant for damages up to two times the amount of the deposit. In any action brought by the tenant to recover the deposit, the prevailing party is entitled to recover the costs of suit or arbitration, including reasonable attorneys' fees.

<p>RENT AND FEE INCREASE NOTICE TO TENANTS</p>
<p>This notice is required by Washington state law to inform you of your rights regarding rent and fee increases. Washington state limits how much your landlord can raise your rent and fees.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Your landlord can raise your rent and fees combined once every 12 months by up to seven percent, as allowed by section 201 of this act. Your landlord is not required to raise the rent or fees by any amount.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your landlord may be exempt from the seven percent limit on rent and fee increases for the reasons described in section 202 of this act. If your landlord claims an exemption, your landlord is required to include supporting facts with this notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your landlord must properly and fully complete the form below to notify you of any rent and fee increases and any exemptions claimed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Your landlord (name) intends to (check one of the following):</p>
<p>__ Raise your rent and/or fees: Your total rent and fee increase effective (date) will be (percent), which totals an additional $(dollar amount) per month, for a new total amount of $(dollar amount) per month for rent and fees combined.</p>
<p>This rent and/or fee increase is allowed by state law and is (check one of the following):</p>
<p>__ A lower rent and/or fee increase than the maximum allowed by state law.</p>
<p>__ The maximum rent and/or fee increase allowed by state law.</p>
<p>__ Authorized by an exemption under section 202 of this act. If the rent and/or fee increase is authorized by an exemption, your landlord must fill out the section of the form below.</p>
<p>EXEMPTIONS CLAIMED BY LANDLORD</p>
<p>Under penalty of perjury, I (landlord name) certify that I am allowed under Washington state law to raise your rent and fees by (percent), which is more than the maximum increase otherwise allowed by state law, because I am claiming the following exemption under section 202 of this act (check one of the following):</p>
<p>__ You live on a manufactured/mobile home lot owned by a public housing authority, public development authority, or nonprofit organization where maximum rents are regulated by other laws or local, state, or federal affordable housing program requirements, or a qualified low-income housing development as defined in RCW 82.45.010, where the property is owned by a public housing authority, public development authority, or nonprofit organization. (The landlord must include facts or attach documents supporting the exemption.)</p>
<p>__ You live in a manufactured/mobile home community that was purchased during the past 12 months by an eligible organization as defined in RCW 59.20.030 whose mission aligns with the long-term preservation and affordability of your manufactured/mobile home community, so the eligible organization may increase the annual rent and fees combined for your manufactured/mobile home community in an amount greater than allowed under section 201 of this act as needed to cover the cost of purchasing your manufactured/mobile home community if the increase is approved by vote or agreement with the majority of the manufactured/mobile home owners in your manufactured/mobile home community. (The landlord must include facts or attach documents supporting the exemption.)&quot;</p>
