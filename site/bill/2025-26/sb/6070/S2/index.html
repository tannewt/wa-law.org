<p>The order shall direct, if the applicant has requested, the furnishing of information, facilities, and technical assistance necessary to accomplish the installation of the pen register, trap and trace device, or cell site simulator device. An order issued under this section shall authorize the installation and use of a: (i) Pen register or a trap and trace device for a period not to exceed sixty days; and (ii) cell site simulator device for sixty days. An extension of the original order may only be granted upon: A new application for an order under subsection (3) of this section; and a showing that there is a probability that the information or items sought under this subsection are more likely to be obtained under the extension than under the original order. No extension beyond the first extension shall be granted unless: There is a showing that there is a high probability that the information or items sought under this subsection are much more likely to be obtained under the second or subsequent extension than under the original order; and there are extraordinary circumstances such as a direct and immediate danger of death or serious bodily injury to a law enforcement officer. The period of extension shall be for a period not to exceed sixty days.</p>

<ol start="5">
<li>Upon the presentation of an order, entered under subsection (4) of this section, by an officer of a law enforcement agency authorized to install and use a pen register under this chapter, a provider of wire or electronic communication service, landlord, custodian, or other person shall furnish such law enforcement officer forthwith all information, facilities, and technical assistance necessary to accomplish the installation of the pen register unobtrusively and with a minimum of interference with the services that the person so ordered by the court accords the party with respect to whom the installation and use is to take place, if such assistance is directed by a court order as provided in subsection (4) of this section.</li>

<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a law enforcement officer and a prosecuting attorney or deputy prosecuting attorney who jointly and reasonably determine in an ongoing criminal investigation, or a law enforcement officer who reasonably determines in a missing endangered person case, that there is probable cause to believe that an emergency situation exists that involves immediate danger of death or serious bodily injury to any person that requires the installation and use of a pen register, trap and trace device, or cell site simulator device before an order authorizing such installation and use can, with due diligence, be obtained, and there are grounds upon which an order could be entered under this chapter to authorize such installation and use, may have installed and use a pen register, trap and trace device, or cell site simulator device . If such an action was taken pursuant to an ongoing criminal investigation or to locate a missing endangered person, law enforcement must obtain, within 48 hours after the installation has occurred, or begins to occur, an order approving the installation or use is issued in accordance with subsection (4) of this section. In the absence of an authorizing order, such use pursuant to an ongoing criminal investigation or to locate a missing endangered person shall immediately terminate when the information sought is obtained; when the application for the order is denied; or when 48 hours have lapsed since the installation of the pen register, trap and trace device, or cell site simulator device; whichever is earlier. If an order approving the installation or use is not obtained within 48 hours, any information obtained is not admissible as evidence in any legal proceeding. The knowing installation or use by any law enforcement officer of a pen register, trap and trace device, or cell site simulator device in an ongoing criminal investigation pursuant to this subsection without application for the authorizing order within 48 hours of the installation shall constitute a violation of this chapter and be punishable as a gross misdemeanor. A provider of a wire or electronic service, landlord, custodian, or other person who furnished facilities or technical assistance pursuant to this subsection shall be reasonably compensated by the law enforcement agency that requests the facilities or assistance for such reasonable expenses incurred in providing such facilities and assistance.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>A law enforcement agency authorized to use a cell site simulator device in accordance with this section must: (i) Take all steps necessary to limit the collection of any information or metadata to the target specified in the applicable court order; (ii) take all steps necessary to permanently delete any information or metadata collected from any party not specified in the applicable court order immediately following such collection and must not transmit, use, or retain such information or metadata for any purpose whatsoever; and (iii) delete any information or metadata collected from the target specified in the court order within 30 days if there is no longer probable cause to support the belief that such information or metadata is evidence of a crime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a law enforcement agency has not obtained a court order approving the use of a cell site simulator device in accordance with this section within 48 hours, or if the application for the court order is denied, the law enforcement agency must take all steps necessary to permanently delete any information or metadata collected from any party upon expiration of the 48 hours or upon denial of the court order, and must not transmit, use, or retain such information or metadata for any purpose whatsoever.</p>
