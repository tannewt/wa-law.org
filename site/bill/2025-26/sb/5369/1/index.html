<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington youth require additional support in order to thrive. Washington has the ninth highest school refusal rate in the country, with 30 percent of K-12 students missing more than 10 percent of the school year. A significant number of Washington's youth experience high rates of emotional, developmental, or behavioral distress, or thoughts of suicide.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that school social workers are uniquely positioned to contribute to K-12 student safety, address student behavioral health care needs, and support students with individualized education programs. School social workers collaborate with school personnel, families, and community organizations to reduce absenteeism, support student mental health, and create inclusive learning environments that prepare students for success in a diverse society.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that the national association of school social workers recommends a ratio of one school social worker to every 250 students, but that Washington has only one school social worker for every 3,798 students. Washington would need to increase this ratio by 93 percent to meet the national standard.</p>
<p>It is therefore the intent of the legislature to increase student access to school social workers through workforce development, collaboration with community organizations, and increased funding.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A school psychologist is a professional educator who holds a valid school psychologist certification as defined by the professional educator standards board. Pursuant to the national association of school psychologists' model for comprehensive and integrated school psychological services, school psychologists deliver services across ten domains of practice. Two domains permeate all areas of service delivery: Data-based decision making; and consultation and collaboration. Five domains encompass direct and indirect services to children and their families: Student-level services, interventions, and instructional supports to develop academic skills; student-level interventions and mental health services to develop social and life skills; systems-level school-wide practices to promote learning; systems-level preventive and responsive services; and systems-level family school collaboration services. The three foundational domains include: Knowledge and skills related to diversity in development and learning; research and program evaluation; and legal and ethical practice.</p>

<li>
<p>A school social worker is a professional in the fields of social work and education who holds a valid school social worker certification as defined by the professional educator standards board. The purpose and role of the school social worker is to serve as an integral link between school, home, and community , helping students achieve academic and social success. This is accomplished by removing barriers and providing services that may include: Mental health counseling; crisis intervention; behavioral consultation; trauma-informed care; support and advocacy for students and families; professional case management; and developing and implementing individualized education programs and plans developed under section 504 of the federal rehabilitation act of 1973.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School social workers provide leadership and professional expertise in the development of school discipline policies and procedures, emphasizing best practices. School social workers also leverage data to track trends, monitor student progress, and assess the effectiveness of interventions. As trained mental health clinicians, school social workers support implementation of social-emotional learning and foster supportive school environments for all students.</p>

<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<p>The school counselor works with developing and leading a comprehensive guidance and counseling program to focus on the academic, career, personal, and social needs of all students. School psychologists carry out special education evaluation duties, among other things. School social workers have the role and scope explicated in RCW 28A.410.044(2). All of these professionals are also involved in multitiered systems of support for academic and behavioral skills. These professionals focus on student mental health, work with at-risk and marginalized students, perform risk assessments, and collaborate with mental health professionals to promote student achievement and create a safe learning environment. In order that school counselors, school social workers, and school psychologists have the time available to prioritize these functions, in addition to other activities requiring direct student contact, responsibilities such as data input and data tracking should be handled by nonlicensed, noncertified staff, where possible.</p>
