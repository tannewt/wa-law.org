## Section 5
1. When a designated crisis responder receives information alleging that a person, as a result of a behavioral health disorder, presents a likelihood of serious harm or is gravely disabled, the designated crisis responder may, after investigation and evaluation of the specific facts alleged and of the reliability and credibility of any person providing information to initiate detention, if satisfied that the allegations are true and that the person will not voluntarily seek appropriate treatment, file a petition for initial detention under this section. Before filing the petition, the designated crisis responder must personally interview the person, unless the person refuses an interview, and determine whether the person will voluntarily receive appropriate evaluation and treatment at an evaluation and treatment facility, crisis stabilization unit, 23-hour crisis relief center, secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or approved substance use disorder treatment program. If the person has a past history of not following through with voluntary evaluation and treatment plans or prematurely discontinuing voluntary treatment, there is a presumption that the patient will not in good faith voluntarily seek appropriate treatment. If a designated crisis responder makes a determination not to detain a person on the basis that the person will voluntarily seek appropriate treatment, the designated crisis responder shall document the reasons the designated crisis responder determined that the person in good faith will voluntarily seek appropriate evaluation and treatment. As part of the assessment, the designated crisis responder must attempt to ascertain if the person has executed a mental health advance directive under chapter 71.32 RCW. The interview performed by the designated crisis responder may be conducted by video provided that a licensed health care professional or professional person who can adequately and accurately assist with obtaining any necessary information is present with the person at the time of the interview.

2. [Empty]

    a. A superior court judge shall issue a warrant to detain a person with a behavioral health disorder to a designated evaluation and treatment facility, a secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or an approved substance use disorder treatment program, for a period of not more than 120 hours for evaluation and treatment upon request of a designated crisis responder whenever it appears to the satisfaction of the judge that:

        i. There is probable cause to support the petition; and

        ii. The person has refused or failed to accept appropriate evaluation and treatment voluntarily.

    b. The petition for initial detention, signed under penalty of perjury, or sworn telephonic testimony may be considered by the court in determining whether there are sufficient grounds for issuing the order.

    c. The order shall designate retained counsel or, if counsel is appointed from a list provided by the court, the name, business address, and telephone number of the attorney appointed to represent the person.

    d. If the court does not issue an order to detain a person pursuant to this subsection (2), the court shall issue an order to dismiss the initial petition.

    e. Upon issuance of a warrant by a superior court judge, a peace officer shall provide assistance in detaining a person as authorized in this section. A peace officer may decline to provide assistance if, in the judgment of the officer based on the totality of the circumstances known at the time, the officer believes there is a reasonable likelihood that the amount of force required to take the person into custody could cause greater harm than the risk of harm to the person and the community posed by the person's behavioral health condition.

3. The designated crisis responder shall then serve or cause to be served on such person and his or her guardian, if any, a copy of the order together with a notice of rights, and a petition for initial detention. After service on such person the designated crisis responder shall file the return of service in court and provide copies of all papers in the court file to the evaluation and treatment facility, secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or approved substance use disorder treatment program, and the designated attorney. The designated crisis responder shall notify the court and the prosecuting attorney that a probable cause hearing will be held within 120 hours of the date and time of outpatient evaluation or admission to the evaluation and treatment facility, secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or approved substance use disorder treatment program. The person shall be permitted to be accompanied by one or more of his or her relatives, friends, an attorney, a personal physician, or other professional or religious advisor or traditional cultural healer to the place of evaluation. An attorney accompanying the person to the place of evaluation shall be permitted to be present during the admission evaluation. Any other individual accompanying the person may be present during the admission evaluation. The facility may exclude the individual if his or her presence would present a safety risk, delay the proceedings, or otherwise interfere with the evaluation.

4. Upon request of the designated crisis responder , a peace officer shall take such person or cause such person to be taken into custody and placed in an evaluation and treatment facility, secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or approved substance use disorder treatment program. At the time such person is taken into custody there shall commence to be served on such person, his or her guardian, and conservator, if any, a copy of the original order together with a notice of rights and a petition for initial detention.

5. In any investigation and evaluation of an individual under this section or RCW 71.05.153 in which the designated crisis responder knows, or has reason to know, that the individual is an American Indian or Alaska Native who receives medical or behavioral health services from a tribe within this state, the designated crisis responder shall notify the tribe and Indian health care provider whether or not a petition for initial detention or involuntary outpatient treatment will be filed as soon as possible, but no later than three hours from the time the decision is made. If a petition for initial detention or involuntary outpatient treatment is filed, the designated crisis responder must provide the tribe and Indian health care provider with a copy of the petition, together with any orders issued by the court and a notice of the tribe's right to intervene as soon as possible, but before the hearing, and no later than 24 hours from the time the petition is served upon the person and the person's guardian. The court clerk shall provide copies of any court orders necessary for the designated crisis responder to provide notice to the tribe or Indian health care provider under this section. Notification under this section is subject to any federal and state laws and regulations including the requirements in RCW 70.02.230 (2)(ff) and (3) and shall be made in person or by telephonic or electronic communication to the tribal contact listed in the authority's tribal crisis coordination plan.

## Section 6
1. When a designated crisis responder receives information alleging that a person, as the result of a behavioral health disorder, presents an imminent likelihood of serious harm, or is in imminent danger because of being gravely disabled, after investigation and evaluation of the specific facts alleged and of the reliability and credibility of the person or persons providing the information if any, the designated crisis responder may take such person, or cause by oral or written order such person to be taken into emergency custody in an emergency department, evaluation and treatment facility, secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or approved substance use disorder treatment program, for not more than 120 hours as described in RCW 71.05.180. If the person is located in a 23-hour crisis relief center when a designated crisis responder takes the person into emergency custody, the person may remain at the 23-hour crisis relief center or an adjacent crisis stabilization facility in accordance with rules promulgated by the department.

2. A peace officer may take or cause such person to be taken into custody and immediately delivered to a crisis stabilization unit, 23-hour crisis relief center, evaluation and treatment facility, secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, approved substance use disorder treatment program, or the emergency department of a local hospital under subsection (1) of this section or when he or she has reasonable cause to believe that such person is suffering from a behavioral health disorder and presents an imminent likelihood of serious harm or is in imminent danger because of being gravely disabled. Upon request of a designated crisis responder, a peace officer shall provide assistance in taking a person into custody under subsection (1) of this section. A peace officer may decline to provide assistance if, in the judgment of the officer based on the totality of the circumstances known at the time, the officer believes there is a reasonable likelihood that the amount of force required to take the person into custody could cause greater harm than the risk of harm to the person and the community posed by the person's behavioral health condition.

3. Persons delivered to a crisis stabilization unit, 23-hour crisis relief center, evaluation and treatment facility, emergency department of a local hospital, secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or approved substance use disorder treatment program by peace officers pursuant to subsection (2) of this section may be held by the facility for a period of up to 12 hours, not counting time periods prior to medical clearance.

4. Within three hours after arrival at an emergency department, not counting time periods prior to medical clearance, the person must be examined by a mental health professional or substance use disorder professional. Within 12 hours of notice of the need for evaluation, not counting time periods prior to medical clearance, the designated crisis responder must determine whether the individual meets detention criteria. In conjunction with this evaluation, the facility where the patient is located must inquire as to a person's veteran status or eligibility for veterans benefits and, if the person appears to be potentially eligible for these benefits, inquire whether the person would be amenable to treatment by the veterans health administration compared to other relevant treatment options. This information must be shared with the designated crisis responder. If the person has been identified as being potentially eligible for veterans health administration services and as being amenable for those services, and if appropriate in light of all reasonably available information about the person's circumstances, the designated crisis responder must first refer the person to the veterans health administration for mental health or substance use disorder treatment at a facility capable of meeting the needs of the person including, but not limited to, the involuntary treatment options available at the Seattle division of the VA Puget Sound health care system. If the person is accepted for treatment by the veterans health administration, and is willing to accept treatment by the veterans health administration as an alternative to other available treatment options, the designated crisis responder, the veterans health administration, and the facility where the patient is located will work to make arrangements to have the person transported to a veterans health administration facility. As part of the assessment, the designated crisis responder must attempt to ascertain if the person has executed a mental health advance directive under chapter 71.32 RCW. The interview performed by the designated crisis responder may be conducted by video provided that a licensed health care professional or professional person who can adequately and accurately assist with obtaining any necessary information is present with the person at the time of the interview. If the individual is detained, the designated crisis responder shall file a petition for detention or a supplemental petition as appropriate and commence service on the designated attorney for the detained person. If the individual is released to the community, the behavioral health service provider shall inform the peace officer of the release within a reasonable period of time after the release if the peace officer has specifically requested notification and provided contact information to the provider.

5. Dismissal of a commitment petition is not the appropriate remedy for a violation of the timeliness requirements of this section based on the intent of this chapter under RCW 71.05.010 except in the few cases where the facility staff or designated crisis responder has totally disregarded the requirements of this section.

## Section 7
1. If a designated crisis responder decides not to detain a person for evaluation and treatment under RCW 71.05.150 or 71.05.153 or 48 hours have elapsed since a designated crisis responder received a request for investigation and the designated crisis responder has not taken action to have the person detained, the following individuals may petition the superior court for the person's initial detention: An intimate partner or family or household member of the person; a guardian or conservator of the person; a representative of a federally recognized Indian tribe if the person is a member of such a tribe; a representative of a human services provider that has provided services to the person; or any person authorized to file a petition under RCW 71.05.148.

2. A petition under this section must be filed within 10 calendar days following the designated crisis responder investigation or the request for a designated crisis responder investigation. If more than 10 days have elapsed, a person authorized to file a petition under this section may request a new designated crisis responder investigation.

3. [Empty]

    a. The petition must be filed in the county in which the designated crisis responder investigation occurred or was requested to occur and must be submitted on forms developed by the administrative office of the courts for this purpose. The petition must be accompanied by a sworn declaration from the petitioner, and other witnesses if desired, describing why the person should be detained for evaluation and treatment. The description of why the person should be detained may contain, but is not limited to, the information identified in RCW 71.05.212.

    b. The petition must contain:

        i. A description of the relationship between the petitioner and the person; and

        ii. The date on which an investigation was requested from the designated crisis responder.

4. The court shall, within one judicial day, review the petition to determine whether the petition raises sufficient evidence to support the allegation. If the court so finds, it shall provide a copy of the petition to the designated crisis responder agency with an order for the agency to provide the court, within one judicial day, with a written sworn statement describing the basis for the decision not to seek initial detention and a copy of all information material to the designated crisis responder's current decision.

5. Following the filing of the petition and before the court reaches a decision, any person, including a mental health professional, may submit a sworn declaration to the court in support of or in opposition to initial detention.

6. The court shall dismiss the petition at any time if it finds that a designated crisis responder has filed a petition for the person's initial detention under RCW 71.05.150 or 71.05.153 or that the person has voluntarily accepted appropriate treatment.

7. The court must issue a final ruling on the petition within five judicial days after it is filed. After reviewing all of the information provided to the court, the court may enter an order for initial detention if the court finds that: (a) There is probable cause to support a petition for detention; and (b) the person has refused or failed to accept appropriate evaluation and treatment voluntarily. The court shall transmit its final decision to the petitioner.

8. If the court enters an order for initial detention, it shall provide the order to the designated crisis responder agency and issue a warrant. The designated crisis responder agency serving the jurisdiction of the court must collaborate and coordinate with law enforcement, including tribal law enforcement, regarding apprehensions and detentions under this subsection, including sharing of information relating to risk and which would assist in locating the person. The law enforcement agency shall provide assistance in locating the person, taking the person into custody, and ensuring the person is transported to a designated evaluation and treatment facility, a secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or an approved substance use disorder treatment program. A law enforcement officer may decline to provide assistance if, in the judgment of the officer based on the totality of the circumstances known at the time, the officer believes there is a reasonable likelihood that the amount of force required to take the person into custody could cause greater harm than the risk of harm to the person and the community posed by the person's behavioral health condition. A person may not be detained to jail pursuant to a warrant issued under this subsection. An order for detention under this section should contain the advisement of rights which the person would receive if the person were detained by a designated crisis responder. An order for initial detention under this section expires 180 days from issuance.

9. Except as otherwise expressly stated in this chapter, all procedures must be followed as if the order had been entered under RCW 71.05.150. RCW 71.05.160 does not apply if detention was initiated under the process set forth in this section.

10. For purposes of this section:

    a. "Family or household member" includes: Persons related by blood, marriage, domestic partnership, or adoption; persons who currently reside together or formerly resided together; and persons who have a biological or legal parent-child relationship, including stepparents and stepchildren and grandparents and grandchildren.

2. If the petition is for mental health treatment, the court or the prosecutor at the time of the probable cause hearing and before an order of commitment is entered shall inform the person both orally and in writing that the failure to make a good faith effort to seek voluntary treatment as provided in RCW 71.05.230 will result in the loss of his or her firearm rights if the person is subsequently detained for involuntary treatment under this section. The respondent or the respondent's counsel may waive in writing the notice required under this subsection if the respondent waives the respondent's presence at or before the time of the probable cause hearing.

3. If the person or his or her attorney alleges, prior to the commencement of the hearing, that the person has in good faith volunteered for treatment, the petitioner must show, by preponderance of the evidence, that the person has not in good faith volunteered for appropriate treatment. In order to qualify as a good faith volunteer, the person must abide by procedures and a treatment plan as prescribed by a treatment facility and professional staff.

    a. At the conclusion of the probable cause hearing, if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that a person detained for behavioral health treatment, as the result of a behavioral health disorder, presents a likelihood of serious harm, or is gravely disabled, and, after considering less restrictive alternatives to involuntary detention and treatment, finds that no such alternatives are in the best interests of such person or others, the court shall order that such person be detained for involuntary treatment not to exceed 14 days in a facility licensed or certified to provide treatment by the department or under RCW 71.05.745.

    b. At the conclusion of the probable cause hearing, if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that a person detained for behavioral health treatment, as the result of a behavioral health disorder, presents a likelihood of serious harm or is gravely disabled, but that treatment in a less restrictive setting than detention is in the best interest of such person or others, the court shall order an appropriate less restrictive alternative course of treatment for up to 90 days.

    c. If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that a person subject to a petition under RCW 71.05.148, as the result of a behavioral health disorder, is in need of assisted outpatient treatment, the court shall order an appropriate less restrictive alternative course of treatment for up to 18 months.

5. An order for less restrictive alternative treatment must name the behavioral health service provider responsible for identifying the services the person will receive in accordance with RCW 71.05.585, and must include a requirement that the person cooperate with the treatment recommendations of the behavioral health service provider.

6. The court shall notify the person orally and in writing that if involuntary treatment is sought beyond the 14-day inpatient or 90-day less restrictive treatment period, such person has the right to a full hearing or jury trial under RCW 71.05.310. If the commitment is for mental health treatment, the court shall also notify the person orally and in writing that the person is barred from the possession of firearms and that the prohibition remains in effect until a court restores his or her right to possess a firearm under RCW 9.41.047.

7. If the court does not issue an order to detain or commit a person under this section, the court shall issue an order to dismiss the petition. If the court dismisses the petition for a person who was detained on the grounds that the person presents a likelihood of serious harm, the court shall enter an order requiring the person to immediately surrender any firearms in the person's possession, custody, or control and any concealed pistol license issued under RCW 9.41.070. Proof of compliance must be provided to the court in the form of a proof of surrender and receipt form, a declaration that the person has no firearms, or other evidence sufficient to establish full and timely compliance. Proof of compliance must be submitted to the court within 24 hours of the person's release from detention following dismissal of the petition. The court shall set a compliance review hearing under section 13 of this act as soon as possible but not later than five days after the dismissal of the petition.

(1) When a designated crisis responder files a petition for initial detention under RCW 71.05.150 or 71.05.153 on the grounds that the person presents a likelihood of serious harm, the petition shall include a copy of the person's driver's license or identicard or comparable information such as their name, address, and date of birth. If the person is not subsequently committed for involuntary treatment under RCW 71.05.240, the court shall forward within three business days of the probable cause hearing a copy of the person's driver's license or identicard, or comparable information, along with the date of release from the facility, to the department of licensing, the criminal division of the county prosecutor in the county in which the petition was filed, and the Washington state patrol firearms background check program, which shall. The Washington state patrol shall enter the information into the Washington state crime information center or other secure database readily accessible to law enforcement officers noting the person is prohibited from possessing a firearm for a period of six months. The Washington state patrol shall also forward the information to the national instant criminal background check system index, denied persons file, created by the federal Brady handgun violence prevention act (P.L. 103-159). Upon expiration of the six-month period during which the person's right to possess a firearm is suspended as provided in RCW 71.05.182, the Washington state patrol firearms background check program must remove the person from the national instant criminal background check system and update the Washington state crime information center or other secure database readily accessible to law enforcement officers.

1. In making a determination of whether a person is gravely disabled, presents a likelihood of serious harm, or is in need of assisted outpatient treatment in a hearing conducted under RCW 71.05.240 or 71.05.320, the court must consider the symptoms and behavior of the respondent in light of all available evidence concerning the respondent's historical behavior.

2. Symptoms or behavior which standing alone would not justify civil commitment may support a finding of grave disability or likelihood of serious harm, or a finding that the person is in need of assisted outpatient treatment, when: (a) Such symptoms or behavior are closely associated with symptoms or behavior which preceded and led to a past incident of involuntary hospitalization, severe deterioration, or one or more violent acts; (b) these symptoms or behavior represent a marked and concerning change in the baseline behavior of the respondent; and (c) without treatment, the continued deterioration of the respondent is probable.

3. [Empty]

    a. In making a determination of whether there is a likelihood of serious harm in a hearing conducted under RCW 71.05.240 or 71.05.320, the court shall give great weight to any evidence before the court regarding whether the person has: (i) A recent history of one or more violent acts; or (ii) a recent history of one or more commitments under this chapter or its equivalent provisions under the laws of another state which were based on a likelihood of serious harm. The existence of prior violent acts or commitments under this chapter or its equivalent shall not be the sole basis for determining whether a person presents a likelihood of serious harm.

    b. For the purposes of this subsection "recent" refers to the period of time not exceeding three years prior to the current hearing.

4. Before making a determination under subsection (2) or (3) of this section, the court shall consult the judicial information system or any related databases, if available, to determine the respondent's criminal history, prior civil commitments under this chapter, and the respondent's firearms history, including purchase history and any concealed pistol license history.

## Section 12
Before release, conditional release, or discharge of a person involuntarily committed for treatment of a mental disorder, the professional person in charge of the facility providing involuntary treatment services shall notify the court of the person's release, conditional release, or discharge at the earliest possible date but no later than five days prior to the person's release, conditional release, or discharge. The professional person in charge of the facility shall also provide the person being released, conditionally released, or discharged with a notice informing the person that the person is required pursuant to the court order issued under section 13 of this act to surrender all firearms in the person's possession, custody, or control, and any concealed pistol license, to a law enforcement agency and provide proof of compliance with the order to surrender firearms to the clerk of the court as required under section 13 of this act.

## Section 13
1. When a court enters an order for involuntary commitment for treatment of a mental disorder under RCW 71.05.240 or 71.05.320, the court shall enter an order requiring the person to surrender all firearms in the person's possession, custody, or control, and any concealed pistol license issued under RCW 9.41.070, to a law enforcement agency.

3. If the person subject to the order to surrender firearms is committed to inpatient treatment, proof of compliance must be provided to the court within 24 hours of the person's release, conditional release, or discharge from inpatient detention. If the person subject to the order to surrender firearms is committed to less restrictive alternative treatment, proof of compliance must be provided to the court within 24 hours of the person's release from detention to less restrictive alternative treatment.

4. Courts shall develop procedures to verify timely and complete compliance with orders to surrender firearms, including compliance review hearings to be held as soon as possible and not later than five days following the person's release or conditional release from inpatient treatment or following release of the person to less restrictive alternative treatment.

5. [Empty]

    a. A compliance review hearing may be waived by the court or held at a later date if the information attested to by the person subject to the order, along with verification from law enforcement and any other relevant evidence, makes a sufficient showing that the person has surrendered all firearms in the person's possession, custody, or control, and any concealed pistol license, to a law enforcement agency, and the court is able to make a finding of compliance. In making its findings regarding compliance, the court should consider any available department of licensing and Washington state patrol firearm records, any affidavits from law enforcement in response to a respondent's declaration regarding firearm surrender, or other relevant evidence regarding firearms or a concealed pistol license in the person's possession, custody, or control.

    b. If the court does not have a sufficient record before it on which to make such a finding of compliance, the court shall set a review hearing to occur as soon as possible and not later than five days following the person's release, conditional release, or discharge from inpatient treatment or release to less restrictive alternative treatment. The clerk of the court shall electronically transmit a copy of the notice of hearing to the law enforcement agency where the person subject to the order resides for personal service or service in the manner provided in the civil rules of superior court or applicable statute.

    c. The person subject to the order must be present at the hearing and provide proof of compliance with the court's order to surrender firearms.

6. [Empty]

    a. If a court finds at the compliance review hearing, or any other hearing where compliance with the order to surrender firearms is addressed, that there is probable cause to believe the respondent was aware of and failed to fully comply with the order, failed to appear at the compliance review hearing, or violated the order after the court entered findings of compliance, pursuant to its authority under chapter 7.21 RCW, the court may issue an arrest warrant and initiate a contempt proceeding to impose remedial sanctions on its own motion, or upon the motion of the prosecuting attorney, and issue an order requiring the respondent to appear, provide proof of compliance with the order, and show cause why the respondent should not be held in contempt of court.

    b. If the respondent is not present in court at the compliance review hearing or if the court issues an order to appear and show cause after a compliance review hearing, the clerk of the court shall electronically transmit a copy of the order to show cause to the law enforcement agency where the respondent resides for personal service or service in the manner provided in the civil rules of superior court or applicable statute.

    c. The order to show cause served upon the respondent shall state the date, time, and location of the hearing and shall include a warning that the respondent may be held in contempt of court if the respondent fails to promptly comply with the terms of the order to surrender firearms and a warning that an arrest warrant could be issued if the respondent fails to appear on the date and time provided in the order.

    d. [Empty]

        i. At the show cause hearing, the respondent must be present and provide proof of compliance with the underlying court order to surrender firearms and demonstrate why the relief requested should not be granted.

        ii. The court shall take judicial notice of the receipt filed with the court by the law enforcement agency pursuant to subsection (8) of this section. The court shall also provide sufficient notice to the law enforcement agency of the hearing. Upon receiving notice pursuant to this subsection, a law enforcement agency shall:

(A) Provide the court with a complete list of firearms surrendered by the respondent or otherwise belonging to the respondent that are in the possession of the law enforcement agency; and

(B) Provide the court with verification that any concealed pistol license issued to the respondent has been surrendered and an agency with authority to revoke the license has been notified.

        iii. If the law enforcement agency has a reasonable suspicion that the respondent is not in full compliance with the terms of the order, the law enforcement agency shall submit the basis for its belief to the court, and may do so through the filing of a declaration.

    e. If the court finds the respondent in contempt, the court may impose remedial sanctions designed to ensure swift compliance with the order to surrender firearms.

7. To help ensure that accurate and comprehensive information about firearms compliance is provided to judicial officers, a representative from the prosecuting attorney's office from the relevant jurisdiction may appear and be heard or submit written information at any hearing that concerns compliance with an order to surrender firearms. The prosecuting attorney's office from the relevant jurisdiction may designate an advocate or a staff person from their office who is not an attorney to appear on behalf of their office. Such appearance does not constitute the unauthorized practice of law.

8. [Empty]

    a. Surrender of firearms to local law enforcement must occur in a safe manner. At the time of surrender, a law enforcement officer taking possession of firearms and any concealed pistol license shall issue a receipt identifying all firearms and any concealed pistol license that have been surrendered and provide a copy of the receipt to the respondent. The law enforcement agency shall file the original receipt with the court and retain a copy of the receipt, electronically whenever electronic filing is available.

3. Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize detention of a person unless a valid order of commitment is in effect.

4. The existence of the notice requirements in this section will not require any extension of the leave date in the event the leave plan changes after notification.

5. The notice requirements contained in this section shall not apply to emergency medical transfers.

If the court disapproves of the release, it may do so only on the basis of substantial evidence. Pursuant to the determination of the court upon the hearing, the committed person shall be released or shall be returned for involuntary treatment subject to release at the end of the period for which he or she was committed, or otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

The committed person shall have the same rights with respect to notice, hearing, and counsel as for an involuntary treatment proceeding, except as set forth in this subsection and except that there shall be no right to jury trial. The issue to be determined at the hearing is whether or not the person may be conditionally released without substantial danger to other persons, or substantial likelihood of committing criminal acts jeopardizing public safety or security. If the court disapproves of the conditional release, it may do so only on the basis of substantial evidence. Pursuant to the determination of the court upon the hearing, the conditional release of the person shall be approved by the court on the same or modified conditions or the person shall be returned for involuntary treatment on an inpatient basis subject to release at the end of the period for which he or she was committed, or otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

## Section 22
1. An agency or facility designated to monitor or provide less restrictive alternative treatment services under a court order or conditional release, or a designated crisis responder, may take action to enforce, modify, or revoke the less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release if the agency, facility, or designated crisis responder determines that:

    a. The person is failing to adhere to the terms and conditions of the order;

    b. Substantial deterioration in the person's functioning has occurred;

    c. There is evidence of substantial decompensation with a reasonable probability that the decompensation can be reversed by further evaluation, intervention, or treatment; or

    d. The person poses a likelihood of serious harm.

2. Actions taken under this section must include a flexible range of responses of varying levels of intensity appropriate to the circumstances and consistent with the interests of the individual and the public in personal autonomy, safety, recovery, and compliance. Available actions may include, but are not limited to, any of the following:

    a. To counsel or advise the person as to their rights and responsibilities under the court order, and to offer incentives to motivate compliance;

    b. To increase the intensity of outpatient services provided to the person by increasing the frequency of contacts with the provider, referring the person for an assessment for assertive community services, or by other means;

    c. To request a court hearing for review and modification of the court order. The request must be directed to the court with jurisdiction over the order and specify the circumstances that give rise to the request and what modification is being sought. The county prosecutor shall assist the entity requesting the hearing and issue an appropriate summons to the person. This subsection does not limit the inherent authority of a treatment provider to alter conditions of treatment for clinical reasons, and is intended to be used only when court intervention is necessary or advisable to secure the person's compliance and prevent decompensation or deterioration;

    d. To detain the person for up to 12 hours for evaluation at an agency, facility providing services under the court order, crisis stabilization unit, 23-hour crisis relief center, emergency department, evaluation and treatment facility, secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or an approved substance use disorder treatment program. The purpose of the evaluation is to determine whether modification, revocation, or commitment proceedings are necessary and appropriate to stabilize the person and prevent decompensation, deterioration, or physical harm. Temporary detention for evaluation under this subsection is intended to occur only following a pattern of noncompliance or the failure of reasonable attempts at outreach and engagement, and may occur only when, based on clinical judgment, temporary detention is appropriate. The agency, facility, or designated crisis responder may request assistance from a peace officer for the purposes of temporary detention under this subsection (2)(d). This subsection does not limit the ability or obligation of the agency, facility, or designated crisis responder to pursue revocation procedures under subsection (5) of this section in appropriate circumstances; and

    e. To initiate revocation procedures under subsection (5) of this section.

3. A court may supervise a person on an order for less restrictive alternative treatment or a conditional release. While the person is under the order, the court may:

    a. Require appearance in court for periodic reviews; and

    b. Modify the order after considering input from the agency or facility designated to provide or facilitate services. The court may not remand the person into inpatient treatment except as provided under subsection (5) of this section, but may take actions under subsection (2)(a) through (d) of this section.

4. The facility or agency designated to provide outpatient treatment shall notify the secretary of the department of social and health services or designated crisis responder when a person fails to adhere to terms and conditions of court ordered treatment or experiences substantial deterioration in his or her condition and, as a result, presents an increased likelihood of serious harm.

5. [Empty]

    a. A designated crisis responder or the secretary of the department of social and health services may, upon their own motion or upon request of the facility or agency designated to provide outpatient care, cause a person to be detained in an evaluation and treatment facility, secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or approved substance use disorder treatment program in or near the county in which he or she is receiving outpatient treatment for the purpose of a hearing for revocation of a less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release order under this chapter. If the person is located in a 23-hour crisis relief center when a designated crisis responder detains the person for revocation of a less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release order under this chapter, the person may remain at the 23-hour crisis relief center or adjacent crisis stabilization facility in accordance with rules promulgated by the department. The designated crisis responder or secretary of the department of social and health services shall file a petition for revocation within 24 hours and serve the person, their guardian, if any, and their attorney. A hearing for revocation of a less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release order may be scheduled without detention of the person.

    b. A person detained under this subsection (5) must be held until such time, not exceeding five days, as a hearing can be scheduled to determine whether or not the order for less restrictive alternative treatment or conditional release should be revoked, modified, or retained. If the person is not detained, the hearing must be scheduled within five days of service on the person. The designated crisis responder or the secretary of the department of social and health services may withdraw its petition for revocation at any time before the court hearing.

    c. A person detained under this subsection (5) has the same rights with respect to notice, hearing, and counsel as in any involuntary treatment proceeding, except as specifically set forth in this section. There is no right to jury trial. The venue for proceedings is the county where the petition is filed. Notice of the filing must be provided to the court that originally ordered commitment, if different from the court where the petition for revocation is filed, within two judicial days of the person's detention.

    d. The issues for the court to determine are whether: (i) The person adhered to the terms and conditions of the order or conditional release; (ii) substantial deterioration in the person's functioning has occurred; (iii) there is evidence of substantial decompensation with a reasonable probability that the decompensation can be reversed by further inpatient treatment; or (iv) there is a likelihood of serious harm; and, if any of the above conditions apply, whether it is appropriate for the court to reinstate or modify the person's less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release  or order the person's detention for inpatient treatment. The person may waive the court hearing and allow the court to enter a stipulated order upon the agreement of all parties. If the court orders detention for inpatient treatment, the treatment period must be for 14 days from the revocation hearing if the less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release  was based on a petition under RCW 71.05.148, 71.05.160, or 71.05.230. The person must return to less restrictive alternative treatment under the order at the end of the 14-day period unless a petition for further treatment is filed under RCW 71.05.320. If the court orders detention for inpatient treatment and the less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release order was based on a petition under RCW 71.05.290 or 71.05.320, the number of days remaining on the order must be converted to days of inpatient treatment.

6. In determining whether or not to take action under this section the designated crisis responder, agency, or facility must consider the factors specified under RCW 71.05.212 and the court must consider the factors specified under RCW 71.05.245 as they apply to the question of whether to enforce, modify, or revoke a court order for involuntary treatment.

7. Upon request of an agency, facility, or designated crisis responder, a peace officer shall provide assistance in detaining a person as authorized under this section. A peace officer may decline to provide assistance if, in the judgment of the officer based on the totality of the circumstances known at the time, the officer believes there is a reasonable likelihood that the amount of force required to take the person into custody could cause greater harm than the risk of harm to the person and the community posed by the person's behavioral health condition.

8. Prior to taking any action to enforce, modify, or revoke a less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release order in which the agency, facility, or designated crisis responder knows, or has reason to know, that the individual is an American Indian or Alaska Native who receives medical or behavioral health services from a tribe within this state, the agency, facility, or designated crisis responder shall notify the tribe and Indian health care provider regarding any action that will be taken under this section as soon as possible, but no later than three hours from the time the decision to take action is made. The agency, facility, or designated crisis responder must provide the tribe and Indian health care provider with a copy of the petition, together with any orders issued by the court and a notice of the tribe's right to intervene as soon as possible, but before any hearing under this section, and no later than 24 hours from the time the petition is served upon the person and the person's guardian. The court clerk shall provide copies of any court orders necessary for the agency, facility, or designated crisis responder to provide notice to the tribe or Indian health care provider under this section. Notification under this section is subject to any federal and state laws and regulations including the requirements in RCW 70.02.230 (2)(ff) and (3) and shall be made in person or by telephonic or electronic communication to the tribal contact listed in the authority's tribal crisis coordination plan.

## Section 23
A warrant for the detention of a person issued by a court under the provisions of this chapter constitutes authority of law for a peace officer to enter the person's residence for the sole purpose of effectuating the detention and transportation of the person to an evaluation and treatment facility, a secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or an approved substance use disorder treatment program.

## Section 33
1. An agency or facility designated to monitor or provide less restrictive alternative treatment services to a minor under a court order or conditional release may take a range of actions to enforce the terms of the order or conditional release in the event the minor is not adhering to the terms or is experiencing substantial deterioration, decompensation, or a likelihood of serious harm. Such actions may include:

    a. Counseling the minor and offering incentives for compliance;

    b. Increasing the intensity of services;

    c. Petitioning the court to review the minor's compliance and optionally modify the terms of the order or conditional release while the minor remains in outpatient treatment;

    d. Requesting assistance from a peace officer for temporarily detaining the minor for up to 12 hours for evaluation at a crisis stabilization unit, evaluation and treatment facility, secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, facility providing services under a court order, or emergency department to determine if revocation or enforcement proceedings under this section are necessary and appropriate to stabilize the minor, if there has been a pattern of noncompliance or failure of reasonable attempts at outreach and engagement; or

    e. Initiating revocation proceedings under subsection (3) of this section.

2. If the professional person in charge of an outpatient treatment program, a designated crisis responder, or the director or secretary, as appropriate, determines that a minor is failing to adhere to the conditions of a court order for less restrictive alternative treatment or the conditions of conditional release, or that substantial deterioration in the minor's functioning has occurred, the designated crisis responder, or the director or secretary, as appropriate, may order that the minor be taken into custody and transported to an inpatient evaluation and treatment facility, a secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or an approved substance use disorder treatment program. If the minor is located in a 23-hour crisis relief center for minors when a designated crisis responder takes the minor into custody, the minor may remain at the 23-hour crisis relief center for minors or adjacent crisis stabilization facility in accordance with rules promulgated by the department of health.

3. [Empty]

    a. The designated crisis responder, director, or secretary, as appropriate, shall file the order of apprehension and detention and serve it upon the minor and notify the minor's parent and the minor's attorney, if any, of the detention within two days of return. At the time of service the minor shall be informed of the right to a hearing and to representation by an attorney. The designated crisis responder or the director or secretary, as appropriate, may modify or rescind the order of apprehension and detention at any time prior to the hearing.

    b. If the minor is involuntarily detained for revocation at an evaluation and treatment facility, secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or approved substance use disorder treatment program in a different county from where the minor was initially detained, the facility or program may file the order of apprehension, serve it on the minor and notify the minor's parents and the minor's attorney at the request of the designated crisis responder.

4. A petition for revocation of less restrictive alternative treatment shall be filed by the designated crisis responder or the director, secretary, or facility, as appropriate, with the court in the county where the minor is detained. The court shall conduct the hearing in that county. A petition for revocation of conditional release must be filed in the county where the minor is detained. A petition shall describe the behavior of the minor indicating violation of the conditions or deterioration of routine functioning and a dispositional recommendation. The hearing shall be held within seven days of the minor's return. The issues to be determined are whether the minor did or did not adhere to the conditions of the less restrictive alternative treatment or conditional release, or whether the minor's routine functioning has substantially deteriorated, and, if so, whether the conditions of less restrictive alternative treatment or conditional release should be modified or whether the court should order the minor's detention for inpatient treatment. Pursuant to the determination of the court, the minor shall be returned to less restrictive alternative treatment or conditional release on the same or modified conditions or shall be detained for inpatient treatment. If the minor is detained for inpatient treatment, RCW 71.34.760 regarding the director's placement responsibility shall apply. The hearing may be waived by the minor and the minor detained for inpatient treatment or returned to less restrictive alternative treatment or conditional release on the same or modified conditions. If the court orders detention for inpatient treatment, the treatment period must be for 14 days from the revocation hearing if the less restrictive alternative treatment order was based on a petition under RCW 71.34.740 or 71.34.815. The minor must return to less restrictive alternative treatment under the order at the end of the 14-day period unless a petition for further treatment is filed under RCW 71.34.750. If the court orders detention for inpatient treatment and the less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release was based on a petition under RCW 71.34.750, the number of days remaining on the less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release must be converted to days of inpatient treatment.

5. Upon request of an agency, facility, or designated crisis responder, a peace officer shall provide assistance in detaining a minor as authorized under this section. If, in the judgment of the officer based on the totality of the circumstances known at the time, the officer believes there is a reasonable likelihood that the amount of force required to take the person into custody could cause greater harm than the risk of harm to the person and the community posed by the person's untreated behavioral health condition, the officer may decline to provide assistance.

6. Prior to taking any action to enforce, modify, or revoke a less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release order in which the agency, facility, or designated crisis responder knows, or has reason to know, that the minor is an American Indian or Alaska Native who receives medical or behavioral health services from a tribe within this state, the agency, facility, or designated crisis responder shall notify the tribe and Indian health care provider regarding any action that will be taken under this section as soon as possible, but no later than three hours from the time the decision to take action is made. The agency, facility, or designated crisis responder must provide the tribe and Indian health care provider with a copy of the petition, together with any orders issued by the court and a notice of the tribe's right to intervene as soon as possible, but before any hearing under this section, and no later than 24 hours from the time the petition is served upon the person and the person's guardian. The court clerk shall provide copies of any court orders necessary for the agency, facility, or designated crisis responder to provide notice to the tribe or Indian health care provider under this section. Notification under this section is subject to any federal and state laws and regulations including the requirements in RCW 70.02.240 and shall be made in person or by telephonic or electronic communication to the tribal contact listed in the authority's tribal crisis coordination plan.
