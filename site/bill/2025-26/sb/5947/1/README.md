    b. Hire any necessary staff;

    c. Set a detailed timeline for plan implementation and submit any necessary waivers to obtain federal approval and funding;

    d. Upon federal approval of a waiver or, if required by federal law or regulation, prior to submission of a waiver application, make recommendations to the legislature to implement the plan, including necessary statutory changes to establish requirements for benefits under the plan, eligibility for the plan, provider participation and payments, and financing for the plan;

    e. Once the plan is implemented, administer all aspects of the plan; and

    f. Conduct activities the health care board considers necessary to carry out the purposes of this act.

5. The authority may adopt any rules necessary to implement this section.
