# SB 6166 - Health care credentials

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6166.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. The terms and titles used by health care professionals in clinical settings play a critical role in ensuring transparency and trust between patients and their health care professionals. Misunderstandings about health care professionals' credentials can lead to patient confusion, erode trust, and impact the quality of care;

    b. All members of the health care team play an important role in patient care, however, the use of the title "doctor" in clinical settings and public communications, without clear clarification, may inadvertently lead patients to believe that these health care professionals have attained a doctor of medicine or doctor of osteopathic medicine degree;

    c. Many patients may not fully understand the distinctions between different health care credentials. Studies have shown that promoting clarity in the titles of health care professionals improves patient satisfaction and ensures that individuals are better informed about the qualifications of the professionals treating them and the level of care that can be appropriately provided;

    d. Protecting patients from potential misrepresentation is critical to maintaining the integrity of the health care system. Transparency in health care professional titles and communications allows patients to make informed decisions and understand the roles of each member of their care team; and

    e. Care delivery has evolved to be more team-based with a focus on patient centered care. Patients need to understand the credentials and qualifications of the health care professionals on their care team.

2. The legislature intends to preserve trust, ensure transparency, and protect patients from unnecessary confusion about the qualifications of their health care professionals.

## Section 2
1. [Empty]

    a. License holders who provide health care services except custodial services, must affirmatively communicate and display the license holder's credentials during all patient encounters by wearing an identification badge that is visible and includes the health care provider's name and health care credential, including the initials and title of any health care-related degree that the license holder may have obtained.

    b. License holders working in nonpatient care settings and who do not have any direct patient care interactions are not subject to the identification badge requirements in (a) of this subsection.

2. Any advertisement for health care services that names a license holder must identify the type of health care credential held by that license holder, including the initials and title of any health care-related degree that the license holder may have obtained.

3. For the purposes of this section:

    a. "Advertisement" means any communication or statement, whether printed, electronic, or oral, that names the license holder in relation to their practice, profession, or institution in which the individual is employed, volunteers, or otherwise provides health care services. The term includes business cards, letterhead, patient brochures, email, internet content, audio and video content, and any other communication or statement used in the course of business.

    b. "Health care service" has the same meaning as in RCW 48.43.005.

## Section 3
Except as provided in RCW 18.130.450, the following conduct, acts, or conditions constitute unprofessional conduct for any license holder under the jurisdiction of this chapter:

1. The commission of any act involving moral turpitude, dishonesty, or corruption relating to the practice of the person's profession, whether the act constitutes a crime or not. If the act constitutes a crime, conviction in a criminal proceeding is not a condition precedent to disciplinary action. Upon such a conviction, however, the judgment and sentence is conclusive evidence at the ensuing disciplinary hearing of the guilt of the license holder of the crime described in the indictment or information, and of the person's violation of the statute on which it is based. For the purposes of this section, conviction includes all instances in which a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is the basis for the conviction and all proceedings in which the sentence has been deferred or suspended. Nothing in this section abrogates rights guaranteed under chapter 9.96A RCW;

2. Misrepresentation or concealment of a material fact in obtaining a license or in reinstatement thereof;

3. All advertising which is false, fraudulent, or misleading;

4. Incompetence, negligence, or malpractice which results in injury to a patient or which creates an unreasonable risk that a patient may be harmed. The use of a nontraditional treatment by itself shall not constitute unprofessional conduct, provided that it does not result in injury to a patient or create an unreasonable risk that a patient may be harmed;

5. Suspension, revocation, or restriction of the individual's license to practice any health care profession by competent authority in any state, federal, or foreign jurisdiction, a certified copy of the order, stipulation, or agreement being conclusive evidence of the revocation, suspension, or restriction;

Nothing in this section abrogates rights guaranteed under chapter 9.96A RCW;
