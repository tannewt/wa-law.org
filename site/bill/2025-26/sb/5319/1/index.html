<ol>
<li>An applicant : (a) For a revision of an existing reclamation permit or reclamation plan; (b) for an expansion of a permitted surface mine; (c) for a new reclamation permit under RCW 78.44.081; or (d) seeking to combine existing public or private surface mine reclamation permits, shall pay a nonrefundable application fee to the department before the department will make a decision on the application.

<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>Any production records, mineral assessments, and trade secrets submitted by a permit holder, mine operator, or landowner to the department are to be held as confidential and not released as part of a public records request under chapter 42.56 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appeals from any determination of the department shall not stay the requirement to pay any annual permit fee. Failure to pay the annual fees may constitute grounds for an order to suspend surface mining, pay fines, or cancel the reclamation permit as provided in this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All fees collected by the department shall be deposited into the surface mining reclamation account created in RCW 78.44.045.</p>

<p>Within 60 days after receipt of an application for a new or expanded permit, or revision to an existing reclamation permit or reclamation plan, the department shall advise applicants of any information necessary to successfully complete the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to other enforcement authority, the department may refer matters to a collection agency licensed under chapter 19.16 RCW when permit fees or fines are past due. The collection agency may impose its own fees for collecting delinquent permit fees or fines.</p>
</li>
