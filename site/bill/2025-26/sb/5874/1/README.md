## Section 1
1. [Empty]

    a. Each employing unit shall keep true and accurate work records, containing such information as the commissioner may prescribe. Such records shall be open to inspection and be subject to being copied by the commissioner or his or her authorized representatives at any reasonable time and as often as may be necessary. The commissioner may require from any employing unit any sworn or unsworn reports with respect to persons employed by it, which he or she deems necessary for the effective administration of this title.

    b. An employer who contracts with another person or entity for work subject to chapter 18.27 or 19.28 RCW shall obtain and preserve a record of the unified business identifier account number for and compensation paid to the person or entity performing the work. In addition to the penalty in subsection (3) of this section, failure to obtain or maintain the record is subject to RCW 39.06.010.

2. [Empty]

    a. [Empty]

        i. Each employer shall register with the department and obtain an employment security account number. Each employer shall make periodic reports at such intervals as the commissioner may by regulation prescribe, setting forth the remuneration paid for employment to workers in its employ, the full names and social security numbers of all such workers, the standard occupational classification or job title of each worker, and the total hours worked by each worker and such other information as the commissioner may by regulation prescribe. The department must allow an employer to amend a periodic report filed before its due date up until the report's due date without penalty.

        ii. A federally recognized tribe may elect to report the standard occupational classifications or job titles of workers. If a federally recognized tribe elects to report standard occupational classifications or job titles, it retains the option to opt out of reporting at any time for any reason it deems necessary. The department shall adopt rules to implement this subsection (2)(a)(ii).

    b. If the employing unit fails or has failed to report the number of hours in a reporting period for which a worker worked, such number will be computed by the commissioner and given the same force and effect as if it had been reported by the employing unit. In computing the number of such hours worked, the total wages for the reporting period, as reported by the employing unit, shall be divided by the dollar amount of the state's minimum wage in effect for such reporting period and the quotient, disregarding any remainder, shall be credited to the worker: PROVIDED, That although the computation so made will not be subject to appeal by the employing unit, monetary entitlement may be redetermined upon request if the department is provided with credible evidence of the actual hours worked. Benefits paid using computed hours are not considered an overpayment and are not subject to collections when the correction of computed hours results in an invalid or reduced claim; however:

        i. A contribution paying employer who fails to report the number of hours worked will have its experience rating account charged for all benefits paid that are based on hours computed under this subsection; and

        ii. An employer who reimburses the trust fund for benefits paid to workers and fails to report the number of hours worked shall reimburse the trust fund for all benefits paid that are based on hours computed under this subsection.

3. Any employer who fails to keep and preserve records required by this section shall be subject to a penalty determined by the commissioner but not to exceed $250 or 200 percent of the quarterly tax for each offense, whichever is greater.

## Section 2
1. If an employer fails to file a timely report as required by RCW 50.12.070, or the rules adopted pursuant thereto, the employer is subject to a penalty of $25 per violation, unless the penalty is waived by the commissioner or subsection (2)(c)(ii) of this section applies.

2. An employer who files an incomplete or incorrectly formatted tax and wage report as required by RCW 50.12.070 must receive a warning letter for the first occurrence. The warning letter will provide instructions for accurate reporting or notify the employer how to obtain technical assistance from the department. Except as provided in subsections (3) and (4) of this section, for subsequent occurrences within five years of the last occurrence, the employer is subject to a penalty as follows:

    a. When no contributions are due: For the second occurrence, the penalty is $75; for the third occurrence, the penalty is $150; and for the fourth occurrence and for each occurrence thereafter, the penalty is $250.

    b. When contributions are due: For the second occurrence, the penalty is 10 percent of the quarterly contributions due, but not less than $75 and not more than $250; for the third occurrence, the penalty is 10 percent of the quarterly contributions due, but not less than $150 and not more than $250; and for the fourth occurrence and each occurrence thereafter, the penalty is $250.

    c. [Empty]

        i. The commissioner may waive penalties for minor or insignificant reporting errors. For purposes of this section, "minor or insignificant reporting errors" includes, but is not limited to, inadvertent errors caused by the failure of any electronic software to properly produce a tax and wage report with the standard occupational classification or job title of each worker.

        ii. An employer whose tax and wage report is incomplete due to a failure to report the standard occupational classification or job title of each worker must pay an incomplete report penalty under this subsection only if the employer knowingly failed to report the standard occupational classification or job title of each worker.

3. If an employer knowingly misrepresents to the employment security department the amount of his or her payroll upon which contributions under this title are based, the employer shall be liable to the state for up to 10 times the amount of the difference in contributions paid, if any, and the amount the employer should have paid and for the reasonable expenses of auditing his or her books and collecting such sums. Such liability may be enforced in the name of the department.

4. If contributions are not paid on the date on which they are due and payable as prescribed by the commissioner, there shall be assessed a penalty of five percent of the amount of the contributions for the first month or part thereof of delinquency; there shall be assessed a total penalty of 10 percent of the amount of the contributions for the second month or part thereof of delinquency; and there shall be assessed a total penalty of 20 percent of the amount of the contributions for the third month or part thereof of delinquency. No penalty so added shall be less than $10. These penalties are in addition to the interest charges assessed under RCW 50.24.040.

5. Penalties shall not accrue on contributions from an estate in the hands of a receiver, executor, administrator, trustee in bankruptcy, common law assignee, or other liquidating officer subsequent to the date when such receiver, executor, administrator, trustee in bankruptcy, common law assignee, or other liquidating officer qualifies as such, but contributions accruing with respect to employment of persons by a receiver, executor, administrator, trustee in bankruptcy, common law assignee, or other liquidating officer shall become due and shall be subject to penalties in the same manner as contributions due from other employers.

6. Where adequate information has been furnished to the department and the department has failed to act or has advised the employer of no liability or inability to decide the issue, penalties shall be waived by the commissioner. Penalties may also be waived for good cause if the commissioner determines that the failure to file timely, complete, and correctly formatted reports or pay timely contributions was not due to the employer's fault.

7. Any decision to assess a penalty as provided by this section shall be made by the chief administrative officer of the tax branch or his or her designee.

8. Nothing in this section shall be construed to deny an employer the right to appeal the assessment of any penalty. Such appeal shall be made in the manner provided in RCW 50.32.030.
