<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Washington has established ambitious policies to decarbonize all sectors of the state's economy by 2050, including:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions limits that reach 95 percent below 1990 levels and net-zero emissions by 2050, under chapter 70A.45 RCW; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A requirement that 100 percent of all sales of electricity to Washington retail electric customers be met by nonemitting electric generation and electricity from renewable resources by January 1, 2045, under chapter 19.405 RCW;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the 2025 northwest regional forecast of power loads and resources, the northwest is dangerously close to experiencing significant energy supply disruption as resource additions in the region continue to lag behind unprecedented electric demand growth, which could lead to blackouts during peak demand events;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the summary report submitted to the legislature by the department of commerce and utilities and transportation commission following the 2025 long-term resource adequacy meeting, the agencies acknowledge a need to consider potential changes to the state's mix of generating resources with a greater focus on the capacity and fuel requirements of the power system during critical periods, such as days of extreme cold combined with low hydroelectric and wind generation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Natural gas used to generate electricity will play an increasingly critical role in the reliable operation of the region's power system between now and 2050, particularly during periods of extreme cold combined with low hydroelectric and wind generation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carbon capture and utilization, or storage technologies such as mineralization or sequestration, including technologies for mineralization and geological sequestration, are commercially viable solutions for mitigating the greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity generation from natural gas systems;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the 2021 Washington state energy strategy, initial investigations by the United States geological survey show meaningful potential for geological carbon storage in Washington, while research by the Pacific Northwest national laboratory has shown previously unrealized potential for carbon storage in the flood basalts common to the state's landscape; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the 2024 biennial update to the 2021 Washington state energy strategy, the department of commerce identified clarifying the eligibility of projects using carbon capture and storage under the Washington clean energy transformation act as a priority strategy for meeting the state's clean energy and decarbonization goals.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to authorize electric utilities to use electricity from natural gas systems operated with carbon capture and utilization, mineralization, or sequestration technology in meeting the 2030 and 2045 requirements of the Washington clean energy transformation act.</p>

<p>This subsection does not permanently relieve a consumer-owned utility of its obligation to comply with the requirements of this chapter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the extent an event or circumstance cannot be reasonably foreseen and ameliorated, such events or circumstances beyond the reasonable control of an electric utility may include but are not limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Weather-related damage;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Natural disasters;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mechanical or resource failure;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failure of a third party to meet contractual obligations to the electric utility;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actions of governmental authorities that adversely affect the generation, transmission, or distribution of nonemitting electric generation or renewable resources owned or under contract to an electric utility, including condemnation actions by municipal electric utilities, public utility districts, or irrigation districts that adversely affect an investor-owned utility's ability to meet the standard established in RCW 19.405.030(1) and 19.405.040(1);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inability to acquire sufficient transmission to transmit electricity from nonemitting electric generation or renewable resources to load; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Substantial limitations, restrictions, or prohibitions on nonemitting electric generation, carbon capture and utilization, mineralization, or sequestration technology consistent with RCW 19.405.050(7), or renewable resources.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An electric utility must notify its retail electric customers in published form within three months of paying the administrative penalty established under subsection (1) of this section. An electric utility is not required to notify its retail electric customers when making a payment in the amount of the administrative penalty as an alternative compliance payment consistent with the requirements of RCW 19.405.040(1)(b).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moneys collected under this section must be deposited into the low-income weatherization and structural rehabilitation assistance account created in RCW 70A.35.030.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For an investor-owned utility, the commission must determine compliance with the requirements of this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For consumer-owned utilities, the auditor is responsible for auditing compliance with this chapter and rules adopted under this chapter that apply to those utilities and the attorney general is responsible for enforcing that compliance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the report submitted under RCW 19.405.080 demonstrates adverse system reliability impacts from the implementation of RCW 19.405.040 and 19.405.050, the governor, consistent with the emergency powers under RCW 43.21G.040, may suspend or delay implementation of this chapter, or exempt an electric utility from paying the administrative penalty under this section, until system reliability impacts can be addressed. Adverse system reliability impacts may include, but are not limited to, the inability of electric utilities or transmission operators to meet reliability standards mandated by federal or state law and required by prudent utility practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding RCW 54.16.020, the fair market value compensation for an asset that is condemned by a municipal electric utility, public utility district, or irrigation district and that is either demonstrated in an electric utility's clean energy action plan or clean energy implementation plan to be used or acquired after May 7, 2019, to meet the requirements of RCW 19.405.040 and 19.405.050, or an asset that generates electricity from renewable resources, carbon capture and utilization, mineralization, or sequestration technology consistent with RCW 19.405.050(7), or nonemitting electric generation, must include but not be limited to a replacement value approach. Additionally, the electric utility may seek, and the court may award, damages attributable to the severance, separation, replacement, or relocation of utility assets. The trier of fact may also consider other damages, as well as offsetting benefits, that it finds just and equitable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An entity that establishes or extends service to the premises of a customer who is being served by an electric utility or was served by an electric utility prior to May 7, 2019, must serve those premises in a manner that complies with the requirements of chapter 288, Laws of 2019 and with chapter 19.285 RCW, if applicable. An electric utility or other entity that fails to comply with the requirements of this subsection must pay the administrative penalty under subsection (1) of this section for each megawatt-hour of electric generation used to serve load that does not meet the terms of this subsection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-8">Section 8 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-8">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An investor-owned utility may petition the commission for a declaratory order pursuant to RCW 34.05.240 to determine whether a proposed energy transformation project, nonemitting electric generation project, project to apply carbon capture and utilization, mineralization, or sequestration technology in a manner consistent with RCW 19.405.050(7), or renewable resource project meets the requirements of RCW 19.405.040 (1) through (3) and 19.405.050 (1) and (5).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The petition for a declaratory order must be in writing and must include information that accurately describes the proposed project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A project that the commission has determined under this section to comply with the requirements of RCW 19.405.040 (1) through (3) or 19.405.050 (1) and (5) may be identified in an investor-owned utility's clean energy action plan under RCW 19.280.030(2) and the utility's clean energy implementation plan under RCW 19.405.060(1).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an investor-owned utility seeks approval of a resource or project in a clean energy implementation plan under RCW 19.405.060, or in a proceeding to set rates, that the commission has previously determined under this section complies with the requirements of RCW 19.405.040 (1) through (3) or 19.405.050 (1) and (5) and the resource or project deviates substantively from the one described in the commission's determination in a manner that affects the resource's or project's potential compliance with RCW 19.405.040 (1) through (3) or 19.405.050 (1) and (5), the commission may reevaluate the resource or project to determine if it complies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-9">Section 9 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The commission may require an applicant to pay an application fee for a declaratory order requested under RCW 19.405.160. The amount of the fee must be set by the commission to solely cover the cost of reviewing the project and preparing a declaratory order, including a legal analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in RCW 19.405.160 preempts the authority of the commission from making a determination, independent of the processes under RCW 19.405.160, on whether a proposed energy transformation project, nonemitting electric generation project, project to apply carbon capture and utilization, mineralization, or sequestration technology in a manner consistent with RCW 19.405.050(7), or renewable resource project, under RCW 19.405.040 and 19.405.050, meets the planning and portfolio requirements of an investor-owned utility's clean energy implementation plan under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A declaratory order issued under RCW 19.405.160 does not by itself determine the prudency associated with an energy transformation project, nonemitting electric generation project, project to apply carbon capture and utilization, mineralization, or sequestration technology in a manner consistent with RCW 19.405.050(7), or renewable resource project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in RCW 19.405.160 may be construed to require an investor-owned utility to seek an order declaring whether the proposed resource or project complies with the requirements of RCW 19.405.040 (1) through (3) or 19.405.050 (1) and (5).</p>
