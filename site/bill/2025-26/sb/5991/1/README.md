# SB 5991 - Carbon capture

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5991.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. Washington has established ambitious policies to decarbonize all sectors of the state's economy by 2050, including:

        i. Economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions limits that reach 95 percent below 1990 levels and net-zero emissions by 2050, under chapter 70A.45 RCW; and

        ii. A requirement that 100 percent of all sales of electricity to Washington retail electric customers be met by nonemitting electric generation and electricity from renewable resources by January 1, 2045, under chapter 19.405 RCW;

    b. According to the 2025 northwest regional forecast of power loads and resources, the northwest is dangerously close to experiencing significant energy supply disruption as resource additions in the region continue to lag behind unprecedented electric demand growth, which could lead to blackouts during peak demand events;

    c. In the summary report submitted to the legislature by the department of commerce and utilities and transportation commission following the 2025 long-term resource adequacy meeting, the agencies acknowledge a need to consider potential changes to the state's mix of generating resources with a greater focus on the capacity and fuel requirements of the power system during critical periods, such as days of extreme cold combined with low hydroelectric and wind generation;

    d. Natural gas used to generate electricity will play an increasingly critical role in the reliable operation of the region's power system between now and 2050, particularly during periods of extreme cold combined with low hydroelectric and wind generation;

    e. Carbon capture and utilization, or storage technologies such as mineralization or sequestration, including technologies for mineralization and geological sequestration, are commercially viable solutions for mitigating the greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity generation from natural gas systems;

    f. According to the 2021 Washington state energy strategy, initial investigations by the United States geological survey show meaningful potential for geological carbon storage in Washington, while research by the Pacific Northwest national laboratory has shown previously unrealized potential for carbon storage in the flood basalts common to the state's landscape; and

    g. In the 2024 biennial update to the 2021 Washington state energy strategy, the department of commerce identified clarifying the eligibility of projects using carbon capture and storage under the Washington clean energy transformation act as a priority strategy for meeting the state's clean energy and decarbonization goals.

2. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to authorize electric utilities to use electricity from natural gas systems operated with carbon capture and utilization, mineralization, or sequestration technology in meeting the 2030 and 2045 requirements of the Washington clean energy transformation act.

    a. A consumer-owned utility must be considered to be in compliance with the standards under RCW 19.405.040(1) and 19.405.050(1) if, over the four-year compliance period, the average annual incremental cost of meeting the standards or the interim targets established under subsection (2) of this section meets or exceeds a two percent increase of the consumer-owned utility's retail revenue requirement above the previous year. All costs included in the determination of cost impact must be directly attributable to actions necessary to comply with the requirements of RCW 19.405.040 and 19.405.050.

    b. If a consumer-owned utility relies on (a) of this subsection as a basis for compliance with the standard under RCW 19.405.040(1), and it has not met 80 percent of its annual retail electric load using electricity from renewable resources, electricity from a natural gas system operated with carbon capture and utilization, mineralization, or sequestration technology in a manner consistent with RCW 19.405.050(7), and nonemitting electric generation, then it must demonstrate that it has maximized investments in renewable resources, carbon capture and utilization, mineralization, or sequestration technology consistent with RCW 19.405.050(7), and nonemitting electric generation prior to using alternative compliance options allowed under RCW 19.405.040(1)(b).

5. The commission, for investor-owned utilities, and the department, for consumer-owned utilities, must adopt rules establishing the methodology for calculating the incremental cost of compliance under this section, as compared to the cost of an alternative lowest reasonable cost portfolio of investments that are reasonably available.

6. The commission may require a large combination utility as defined in RCW 80.86.010 to incorporate the requirements of this section into an integrated system plan established under RCW 80.86.020.

## Section 6
By January 1, 2024, and at least every four years thereafter and in compliance with RCW 43.01.036, the department must submit a report to the legislature. The report must include the following:

1. A review of the standards described in RCW 19.405.030 through 19.405.050 focused on technologies, forecasts, and existing transmission, and an evaluation of safety, environmental and public safety protection, affordability, and system reliability.

## Section 8
1. An investor-owned utility may petition the commission for a declaratory order pursuant to RCW 34.05.240 to determine whether a proposed energy transformation project, nonemitting electric generation project, project to apply carbon capture and utilization, mineralization, or sequestration technology in a manner consistent with RCW 19.405.050(7), or renewable resource project meets the requirements of RCW 19.405.040 (1) through (3) and 19.405.050 (1) and (5).

2. The petition for a declaratory order must be in writing and must include information that accurately describes the proposed project.

3. A project that the commission has determined under this section to comply with the requirements of RCW 19.405.040 (1) through (3) or 19.405.050 (1) and (5) may be identified in an investor-owned utility's clean energy action plan under RCW 19.280.030(2) and the utility's clean energy implementation plan under RCW 19.405.060(1).

4. If an investor-owned utility seeks approval of a resource or project in a clean energy implementation plan under RCW 19.405.060, or in a proceeding to set rates, that the commission has previously determined under this section complies with the requirements of RCW 19.405.040 (1) through (3) or 19.405.050 (1) and (5) and the resource or project deviates substantively from the one described in the commission's determination in a manner that affects the resource's or project's potential compliance with RCW 19.405.040 (1) through (3) or 19.405.050 (1) and (5), the commission may reevaluate the resource or project to determine if it complies.

## Section 9
1. The commission may require an applicant to pay an application fee for a declaratory order requested under RCW 19.405.160. The amount of the fee must be set by the commission to solely cover the cost of reviewing the project and preparing a declaratory order, including a legal analysis.

2. Nothing in RCW 19.405.160 preempts the authority of the commission from making a determination, independent of the processes under RCW 19.405.160, on whether a proposed energy transformation project, nonemitting electric generation project, project to apply carbon capture and utilization, mineralization, or sequestration technology in a manner consistent with RCW 19.405.050(7), or renewable resource project, under RCW 19.405.040 and 19.405.050, meets the planning and portfolio requirements of an investor-owned utility's clean energy implementation plan under this chapter.

3. A declaratory order issued under RCW 19.405.160 does not by itself determine the prudency associated with an energy transformation project, nonemitting electric generation project, project to apply carbon capture and utilization, mineralization, or sequestration technology in a manner consistent with RCW 19.405.050(7), or renewable resource project.

4. Nothing in RCW 19.405.160 may be construed to require an investor-owned utility to seek an order declaring whether the proposed resource or project complies with the requirements of RCW 19.405.040 (1) through (3) or 19.405.050 (1) and (5).
