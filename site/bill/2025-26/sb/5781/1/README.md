# SB 5781 - FDA labeling

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5781.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. The United States food and drug administration is the federal agency responsible for protecting public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, our nation's food supply, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation;

    b. Food and drug administration authorization and approval sets forth conditions related to printed matter, advertising, and promotion;

    c. The United States department of health and human services spent nearly $1,000,000,000 hiring a behavioral change company, Fors Marsh, to execute COVID-19 campaigns, promoting masking, vaccination, and other measures in Washington state while ignoring the very same promotional conditions the food and drug administration placed on those interventions;

    d. The United States centers for disease control and prevention also made recommendations and promoted products outside of the food and drug administration limitations;

    e. The governor, the Washington state department of health, local health departments, and numerous public and private organizations also ignored the food and drug administration promotional limitations, overstating the benefits of COVID-19 interventions to the public; and

    f. The government's response to the pandemic resulted in a collapse of the public's trust in public health messaging, as detailed in the October 2024 report from house energy and commerce committee, chair Cathy McMorris Rogers: "We Can Do This: An Assessment of the Department of Health and Human Services' COVID-19 Public Health Campaign" where the centers for disease control an prevention's guidance went beyond the terms of food and drug administration's emergency use authorization to state, without evidence, that COVID-19 vaccines were highly effective against transmission. This ultimately had a negative impact on vaccine confidence and the centers for disease control and prevention's credibility now that the unproven claim has been retracted.

2. Therefore, in order to restore and maintain trust in public health messaging, the legislature intends that all policies and communications related to food and drug administration-regulated products, treatments, or devices follow the same promotional instructions and limitations provided in food and drug administration authorization or approval and be free from unproven claims or promotional language that could mislead consumers.

## Section 2

## Section 3
1. The department, other executive branch actors, and local health departments may only promote, distribute, or endorse food and drug administration-regulated products in compliance with the same terms and conditions specified in food and drug administration labeling. Promotion, distribution, or endorsement extends to information concerning general categories or types of food and drug administration-regulated products where no specific product is referenced.

3. The department, other executive branch actors, and local health departments may not use funding or other forms of inducements that might lead to the dissemination of information that does not conform to food and drug administration labeling.

4.

4. The state auditor shall:

    a. Accept and investigate complaints concerning violations of section 3 of this act;

    b. Ensure complainants are protected against retaliation; and

    c. Consider evidence of retaliation as a separate violation of this section and investigate accordingly.

## Section 5
Violation of sections 3 and 4 of this act by any employee of the executive branch or local health department shall result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.
