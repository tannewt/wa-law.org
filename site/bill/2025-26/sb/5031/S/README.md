# SB 5031 - Confinement health coord.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5031-S.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that the growing number of projects and programs between and within government agencies related to the health of individuals housed in confinement settings create challenges in coordination and communication. These health issues include mental health, traumatic brain injury, substance use, communicable disease and infection prevention, health preventive services, and excess mortality.

The legislature further finds that health in correctional institutions and other confinement settings is vital to public health and reentry because many individuals in these settings interact with and return to their communities. Statewide coordination and communication efforts for treating individuals in correctional and other confinement facilities will positively influence the community and reentry of such individuals.

The legislature intends to address the lack of coordination and communication caused by the numerous projects and programs relating to individuals housed in confinement settings by creating a new council within the department of health that will be supported by representation from state agencies, local governments, federally recognized tribes, and other relevant parties.
