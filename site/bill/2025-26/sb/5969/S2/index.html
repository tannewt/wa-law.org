<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction shall develop and maintain a statewide online system for individualized education programs. In developing and implementing the online system, the superintendent of public instruction must collaborate with educational service districts or an information processing cooperative established under chapter 28A.310 RCW by agreement pursuant to chapter 39.34 RCW. The superintendent may delegate implementation of the online system as authorized under RCW 28A.310.470.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose of the online system is to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Provide a uniform, centralized platform for creating and managing individualized education programs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure compliance with federal and state special education requirements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of individualized education program development and oversight; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve educator collaboration and serve as an instructional tool designed to improve educational outcomes by aligning individualized supports and services with evidence-based instructional practices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The online system must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Have a statewide model that is made available at no cost to school districts, charter schools established under chapter 28A.710 RCW, and state-tribal education compact schools subject to chapter 28A.715 RCW;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorporate safeguards to protect confidential student information, including compliance with the federal family educational rights and privacy act and any other applicable privacy laws;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow for secure, role-based access so that only authorized users may view or modify individualized education programs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be able to integrate emerging technologies to continually enhance its functionality and effectiveness;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be able to integrate a student's transition plan as developed under RCW 28A.155.220 with the universal online high school and beyond plan platform as developed under RCW 28A.230.215, to the greatest extent possible, in order to relieve duplication between the two plans;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that individualized education programs can show evidence of access to grade-level standards, reasonable progress, improved student outcomes, and students' strengths and needs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include integrated language support and translation services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow for robust family engagement, including access to information about student progress that includes both qualitative and quantitative data and that provides information about how individualized education program goals connect to grade-level standards; and</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>Comply with applicable state and federal accessibility standards.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction shall ensure statewide professional development opportunities are available to educators, administrators, and families to support the effective use and implementation of the statewide online system for individualized education programs, including targeted technical assistance.</p>
</li>

<p>By grade seven, each student must be administered a career interest and skills inventory which is intended to be used to inform grade eight course taking and development of an initial high school and beyond plan. No later than grade eight, each student must have begun development of a high school and beyond plan that includes a proposed plan for first-year high school courses aligned with graduation requirements and secondary and postsecondary goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each student who has not earned a score of level 3 or 4 on the middle school mathematics assessment identified in RCW 28A.655.070 by grade nine, the high school and beyond plan must be updated to ensure that the student takes a mathematics course in both grades nine and 10. These courses may include career and technical education equivalencies in mathematics adopted pursuant to RCW 28A.230.097.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
