<p>By grade seven, each student must be administered a career interest and skills inventory which is intended to be used to inform grade eight course taking and development of an initial high school and beyond plan. No later than grade eight, each student must have begun development of a high school and beyond plan that includes a proposed plan for first-year high school courses aligned with graduation requirements and secondary and postsecondary goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each student who has not earned a score of level 3 or 4 on the middle school mathematics assessment identified in RCW 28A.655.070 by grade nine, the high school and beyond plan must be updated to ensure that the student takes a mathematics course in both grades nine and 10. These courses may include career and technical education equivalencies in mathematics adopted pursuant to RCW 28A.230.097.</p>
</li>

<p>Each school district shall provide students who have not met the standard on state assessments or who are behind in completion of credits or graduation pathway options with the opportunity to access interventions and academic supports, courses, or both, designed to enable students to meet all high school graduation requirements. The parents or legal guardians shall be notified about these opportunities as included in the student's high school and beyond plan, preferably through a student-led conference, including the parents or legal guardians, and at least annually until the student is on track to graduate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For students with an individualized education program, the high school and beyond plan must be developed and updated in alignment with their school to postschool transition plan. The high school and beyond plan must be developed and updated in a similar manner and with similar school personnel as for all other students.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>School districts shall involve parents and legal guardians to the greatest extent feasible in the process of developing and updating the high school and beyond plan.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction must establish interagency agreements with the department of social and health services, the department of services for the blind, and any other state agency that provides high school transition services for special education students. Such interagency agreements shall not interfere with existing individualized education programs, nor override any individualized education program team's decision-making power. The purpose of the interagency agreements is to foster effective collaboration among the multiple agencies providing transition services for individualized education program-eligible special education students from the beginning of transition planning, as soon as educationally and developmentally appropriate, through the end of the school year in which the student turns 22 years of age, or through high school graduation, whichever occurs first. Interagency agreements are also intended to streamline services and programs, promote efficiencies, and establish a uniform focus on improved outcomes related to self-sufficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>When educationally and developmentally appropriate, the interagency responsibilities and linkages with transition services under subsection (1) of this section must be addressed in a transition plan to a postsecondary setting in the individualized education program of a student with disabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transition planning shall be based upon educationally and developmentally appropriate transition assessments that outline the student's individual needs, strengths, preferences, and interests. Transition assessments may include observations, interviews, inventories, situational assessments, formal and informal assessments, as well as academic assessments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The transition services that the transition plan must address include activities needed to assist the student in reaching postsecondary goals and courses of study to support postsecondary goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transition activities that the transition plan may address include instruction, related services, community experience, employment and other adult living objectives, daily living skills, and functional vocational evaluation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When educationally and developmentally appropriate, a discussion must take place with the student and parents, and others as needed, to determine the postsecondary goals or postschool vision for the student. This discussion may be included as part of an annual individualized education program review, high school and beyond plan meeting, or any other meeting that includes parents, students, and educators. The postsecondary goals included in the transition plan shall be goals that are measurable and must be based on appropriate transition assessments related to training, education, employment, and independent living skills, when necessary. The goals must also be based on the student's needs, while considering the strengths, preferences, and interests of the student.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the student gets older, changes in the transition plan may be noted in the annual update of the student's individualized education program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a student with a required transition plan under this subsection (2) elects to have both a transition plan and a high school and beyond plan under RCW 28A.230.212, the transition plan must be aligned with the student's high school and beyond plan.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the extent that data is available through data-sharing agreements established by the education data center under RCW 43.41.400, the education data center must monitor the following outcomes for individualized education program-eligible special education students after high school graduation:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The number of students who, within one year of high school graduation:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Enter integrated employment paid at the greater of minimum wage or competitive wage for the type of employment, with access to related employment and health benefits; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter a postsecondary education or training program focused on leading to integrated employment;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The wages and number of hours worked per pay period;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The impact of employment on any state and federal benefits for individuals with disabilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indicators of the types of settings in which students who previously received transition services primarily reside;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indicators of improved economic status and self-sufficiency;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data on those students for whom a postsecondary or integrated employment outcome does not occur within one year of high school graduation, including:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Information on the reasons that the desired outcome has not occurred;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of months the student has not achieved the desired outcome; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The efforts made to ensure the student achieves the desired outcome.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the extent that the data elements in subsection (3) of this section are available to the education data center through data-sharing agreements, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must prepare an annual report using existing resources and submit the report to the legislature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To minimize gaps in services through the transition process, no later than three years before students receiving special education services leave the school system, the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall transmit a list of potentially eligible students to the department of social and health services, the counties, the department of services for the blind, and any other state agency working with individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall ensure that consent be obtained prior to the release of this information as required in accordance with state and federal requirements.</p>
