<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that because burning coal releases several carcinogenic toxins and pollutants, it is the dirtiest way to produce electricity. It also finds that investments in coal-fired resources contribute to climate change, damage the environment, air, water, and soil, and disproportionately harm the health of vulnerable populations and overburdened communities.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that Washington has committed to decarbonizing its energy sector by requiring that each electric utility eliminate coal-fired resources from its allocation of electricity by December 31, 2025. To support the elimination of coal-fired electricity generation and protect ratepayers, the legislature has required the utilities and transportation commission to accelerate depreciation schedules for coal-fired resources owned by investor-owned utilities by no later than the end of 2025.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that the state investment board maintains investments in coal assets at a time when governments, public pension funds, and institutional investors, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, the New York state common retirement fund, the New York city employees' retirement system, and the Oregon public employees retirement fund have committed to divesting from coal. The legislature further finds that the state investment board has developed a climate blueprint to guide investment decisions that impact and are impacted by climate change while fulfilling its mission of maximizing returns at a prudent level of risk for the benefit of beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to protect public health and the environment and align with Washington's clean energy goals by divesting all funds under management by the state investment board from thermal coal.</p>
