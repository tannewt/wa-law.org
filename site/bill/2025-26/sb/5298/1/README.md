The parties have an overall duty to act in good faith. With respect to negotiation, this overall duty of good faith requirement means that the owner must allow the tenants to develop an offer, must give their offer reasonable consideration, and to further competition, must inform any qualified tenant organization, eligible organizations, and competing potential buyers participating in negotiations upon receipt if a preferred offer is submitted.

3. A minor error in providing the notice required by RCW 59.20.325  does not prevent the owner from selling the manufactured/mobile home community to an entity that is not formed by or associated with the tenants and does not cause the owner to be liable to the tenants for damages or a penalty.

4. During the process described in RCW 59.20.325 , the owner may seek, negotiate with, or enter into a contract subject to the rights of the tenants in chapter 40, Laws of 2023 with potential purchasers other than the tenants or an entity formed by or associated with the tenants or another eligible organization.

5. If the owner does not comply with the requirements of chapter 40, Laws of 2023 in a substantial way that prevents the tenants or an eligible organization from competing to purchase the manufactured/mobile home community, the tenants or eligible organization may:

    a. Obtain injunctive relief to prevent a sale or transfer to an entity that is not formed by or associated with the tenants; and

    b. Recover actual damages not to exceed twice the monthly rent from the owner for each tenant.

6. If a party misuses or discloses, in a substantial way, confidential information , that party may recover actual damages from the other party.

Within six months from the date of delivery of a notice of opportunity to compete to purchase as provided in RCW 59.20.325, the owner must provide the department of commerce by mail, electronic delivery, or personal delivery an update on the status of the notification and an update on the status of sale. The update will be made publicly available by the department of commerce within 10 business days of receipt. The notice must include:

    a. The date that the notice was sent by mail, electronically delivered, or personally delivered to all recipients as set forth in RCW 59.20.325;
