The auditor shall send the mail ballot as soon as practicable after the application arrives. If a voter registration application is received within 20 days prior to an election and the covered voter has provided an email address, a notification should be immediately provided on how to obtain a ballot by email or online in the event that the voter does not receive it by election day.

## Section 109
1. The county auditor must mail UOCAVA ballots to each service and overseas voter at least 30 days before each special election, and at least 45 days before each primary or general election, presidential primary, or any special election that involves a federal office.

A covered voter who requests that a ballot and balloting materials be sent to the voter by electronic transmission may choose facsimile transmission or email delivery, or, if offered by the voter's jurisdiction, internet delivery. The auditor shall transmit the ballot to the voter using the means of transmission chosen by the voter.

3. If a ballot application from a covered voter arrives after the jurisdiction begins transmitting ballots to voters, the auditor shall transmit a ballot as soon as practicable.

4. Failure to mail ballots as prescribed in this section does not by itself provide a basis for an election contest or other legal challenge to the results of a primary, general election, or special election.

## Section 110
To be valid, a voted UOCAVA ballot must be received by the appropriate county auditor not later than the day prior to the county certification of election results for that election, and the voter must have submitted the ballot for mailing, or other authorized means of delivery not later than 8:00 p.m. the date of the election.

2. If, at the time of completing a UOCAVA ballot, the voter has signed and dated the ballot declaration under penalty of perjury that the ballot was timely submitted, the ballot may not be rejected on the basis that it has a late postmark, an unreadable postmark, or no postmark.

## Section 113
The secretary of state, in coordination with county auditors, shall implement an electronic free-access system by which a covered voter may determine by telephone, email, or internet whether:

An email address provided by a covered voter may not be made available to the public or any individual or organization other than an authorized agent of the county auditor and is exempt from inspection and copying under chapter 42.56 RCW. The address may be used only for official communication with the voter about the voting process, including transmitting military-overseas ballots and election materials if the voter has requested electronic transmission, and verifying the voter's mailing address and physical location. The request for an email address must describe the purposes for which the email address may be used and include a statement that any other use or disclosure of the email address is prohibited.

2. A covered voter who provides an email address may make a standing request for electronic delivery of a ballot for all elections held in which the voter is eligible to vote while the voter is registered as an overseas or uniformed-service voter. A county auditor shall provide a military-overseas ballot by electronic delivery to a voter who makes a standing request for each election to which the request is applicable.

## Section 115

## Section 117
1. At least 90 days before a regularly scheduled election and as soon as practicable before a special election, the county auditor shall prepare a list of known candidates and issues referred to the ballot for that jurisdiction, to be used in conjunction with a federal write-in absentee ballot. The list must contain all the ballot measures and federal, state, and local offices that as of that date the official expects to be on the ballot on the date of the election. This list must be accompanied by specific instructions for how a voter is to indicate on the federal write-in absentee ballot the voter's choice for each office to be filled and for each ballot measure to be contested.

2. A covered voter may request a copy of this list and instructions. The official charged with preparing the list shall send it to the voter by facsimile, email, or regular mail, as the voter requests.

## Section 118
1. If a voter's mistake or omission in the completion of a document under this chapter does not prevent determining whether a covered voter is eligible to vote, the mistake or omission does not invalidate the document. Failure to satisfy a nonsubstantive requirement, such as using paper or envelopes of a specified size or weight, does not invalidate a document submitted under this chapter. In a write-in ballot authorized by this chapter, if the intention of the voter is discernible under the statewide standard uniform definition of what constitutes a vote published by the secretary of state, an abbreviation, misspelling, or other minor variation in the form of the name of a candidate or a political party must be accepted as a valid vote.

2. The declaration and any information in the declaration may be compared with information on file to ascertain the validity of the document.

3. Notarization is not required for the execution of a document under this chapter.

5. Personnel shall verify that the voter's signature on the ballot declaration is the same as the signature of that voter in the registration files of the county. Verification may be conducted by an automated verification system approved by the secretary of state. A variation between the signature of the voter on the ballot declaration and the signature of that voter in the registration files due to the substitution of initials or the use of common nicknames is permitted so long as the surname and handwriting are clearly the same.

6. If the postmark is missing or illegible, the date on the ballot declaration to which the voter has attested determines the validity, as to the time of voting, for that ballot. For overseas voters and service voters, the date on the declaration to which the voter has attested determines the validity, as to the time of voting, for that ballot.
