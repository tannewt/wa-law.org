<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the tourism industry is the fourth largest economic sector in the state, generating approximately $23.9 billion in annual revenue and employing more than 230,000 direct and induced jobs. Industry data estimates that every dollar a tourist spends generates $1.36 in additional economic impact. In 2018, the legislature created a state-funded tourism marketing program. During the 2023-2025 fiscal biennium, the Washington tourism marketing authority was funded with $4,500,000 per fiscal year. This is significantly less than competitive states. The Washington tourism marketing authority contracts with state of Washington tourism to implement the state tourism program, the results of which have been documented to draw $29 in visitor expenditures for every $1 invested and $3 in state and local tax revenue for every $1 invested.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to solicit recommendations to evaluate an industry self-supported assessment to ensure a dedicated and sustainable funding mechanism for statewide tourism promotion and management.</p>
