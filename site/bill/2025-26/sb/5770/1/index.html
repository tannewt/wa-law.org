<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that housing security is important to all Washingtonians.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that homeownership is the main mechanism for creating wealth for the middle class and working families and passing it on generationally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that one's home is not simply an asset to build wealth, but also a critical tool for maintaining one's security and well-being, and Washington's tax code makes no distinction between one's home and other real property subject to property taxation, contributing to loss of property and displacement, particularly for those on fixed incomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that many Washingtonians are vulnerable to foreclosure by mortgage holders and other secured creditors, despite the homestead exemption limited in bankruptcy statute, RCW 6.13.030, which is a tool to protect heads of households from having their homes confiscated and sold to satisfy debts from unsecured creditors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to prevent more displacement and loss of real property by exempting a portion of tax of one's principal place of residence to achieve the goal of making sure individuals can reside, raise their families, age in place, and stay in their communities, without fear of displacement due to crises or increase in land and home value assessment. The legislature intends to create a means of providing equity in the tax code by treating one's primary home, including community land trusts and cooperative ownership, differently than other property across Washington.</p>

<p>Subject to the conditions in this section, a portion of the assessed value of a residence is exempt from the state levy but not from property taxes levied by any local taxing district. Subject to the adjustments and limitations in this subsection (1), and for taxes levied for collection in 2028 and thereafter, the primary residence property tax exemption from the state levy is equal to the greater of $100,000 assessed valuation or 60 percent of the county median residential assessed value for the most recent year the department collected data by county.</p>

<p>By August 1st each year, the department shall provide each county assessor a list of all claimants filing an application in the current calendar year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As resources allow, the department shall work with assessors to verify claimants have applied for an exemption for only one residence. As resources allow, the department must notify claimants who appear to have applied for more than one residence or when the department is unable to confirm that the claimant applied for an exemption for only one residence. Such notification may be provided electronically and include a request for additional information needed to confirm that the claimant has applied for only one residence. The verification process under this subsection (3)(d) is not a prerequisite for approval of an application for the primary residence property tax exemption. The department is not required to verify every application.</p>

<li>
<p>By August 1st each year, the department shall provide each county assessor a list of all claimants where the department has determined that a claimant may have applied for an exemption for more than one residence.</p>

<p>If the claimant resides in a cooperative housing association, corporation, or partnership, the application must also be signed by the authorized agent of such cooperative. If the claimant holds a life estate in the residence for which the primary residence property tax exemption is claimed and the claimant is not shown on the tax rolls as the taxpayer for that residence, the remainderman or other person shown on the tax rolls as the taxpayer must also sign the application.</p>

<p>Notice of the primary residence property tax exemption and where to obtain further information about the exemption must be included on or with property tax statements and revaluation notices for residential property. The department and each county assessor must publicize the qualifications and manner of making claims for the primary residence property tax exemption, including paid advertisements or notices as deemed appropriate in the sole discretion of the department and county assessors.

<li>
<p>The following conditions apply to the primary residence property tax exemption:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The residence must be occupied by the claimant as the claimant's principal place of residence as of the date of the signed application under subsection (3) of this section. A claimant who sells, transfers, or is displaced from the claimant's residence may transfer the claimant's exemption status to a replacement residence, but no claimant may receive the primary residence property tax exemption on more than one residence in any calendar year. However, the confinement of the claimant to a hospital, nursing home, assisted living facility, or adult family home will not disqualify the claim of exemption if:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The residence is temporarily unoccupied;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The residence is occupied by either a spouse or state registered domestic partner, a person financially dependent on the claimant for support, or both; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The residence is rented for the purpose of paying the claimant's costs of a nursing home, hospital, assisted living facility, or adult family home.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the time of signing the application:</p>
<p>i.(A) The claimant must have owned, in fee or by contract purchase, or have held a life estate in, the residence for which the primary residence property tax exemption is claimed; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(B) The residence must have been located on a tax parcel with fewer than five residences; or</p>
<pre><code>    ii. If the claimant resides in a cooperative housing association, corporation, or partnership, including a mobile home park cooperative or manufactured housing cooperative, the claimant must own a share in the cooperative representing the unit or dwelling in which the claimant resides or the lot on which the claimant's manufactured/mobile home or park model is situated.

c. For purposes of this section, a residence owned by a marital community, state registered domestic partners, or cotenants is deemed to be owned by each spouse, domestic partner, or cotenant, and any lease for life or 99 years of a single-family dwelling unit or the land upon which it stands is deemed a life estate in the residence.

d. [Empty]

    i. The assessed value of a dwelling owned by a cooperative housing association, corporation, or partnership must be reduced, for purposes of state property taxes levied on the dwelling, by the amount of the primary residence property tax exemption to which a claimant residing in that dwelling is entitled. The cooperative must pass the full amount of its property tax savings under this section to its members in proportion to each member's primary residence property tax exemption. The cooperative may meet its obligation under this subsection (6)(d)(i) by reducing the amount owed by the members to the cooperative or, if no amount be owed, by making payment to the members.

    ii. A mobile home park cooperative or manufactured housing cooperative is entitled to any unused portion of the primary residence property tax exemption of its members. A mobile home park cooperative or manufactured housing cooperative receiving the unused portion of the primary residence property tax exemption of its members must pass the full amount of its property tax savings to its members in proportion to each member's unused primary residence property tax exemption. The cooperative may meet its obligation under this subsection (6)(d)(ii) by reducing the amount owed by the members to the cooperative or, if no amount be owed, by making payment to the members. For purposes of this subsection (6)(d)(ii), &quot;unused portion of the primary residence property tax exemption&quot; means the amount by which the exemption exceeds the assessed value of the manufactured/mobile home or park model owned by a member of the mobile home park cooperative or manufactured housing cooperative.

e. [Empty]

    i. Where a claimant has a life estate in the single-family dwelling unit, the land upon which it sits, or both, which comprise the claimant's residence, and a remainderman or other person would have otherwise paid the state property tax exempted on the residence, or portion of the residence, as a result of the claimant's primary residence property tax exemption, such remainderman or other person must reduce the amount owed by the claimant to the remainderman or other person by the amount of the tax savings from the claimant's primary residence property tax exemption. If no amount is owed by the claimant to the remainderman or other person, the remainderman or other person must make payment to the claimant in the full amount of the tax savings from the claimant's primary residence property tax exemption.

    ii. Where a claimant has a life estate in a cooperative ownership or a community land trust, which comprise the claimant's residence, and a remainderman or other person would have otherwise paid the state property tax exempted on the residence, or portion of the residence, as a result of the claimant's primary residence property tax exemption, such remainderman or other person must reduce the amount owed by the claimant to the remainderman or other person by the amount of the tax savings from the claimant's primary residence property tax exemption. If no amount is owed by the claimant to the remainderman or other person, the remainderman or other person must make payment to the claimant in the full amount of the tax savings from the claimant's primary residence property tax exemption.

<p>Prior to July 15th, the county legislative authority must form a board for the equalization of the assessment of the property of the county. The members of the board must receive a per diem amount as set by the county legislative authority for each day of actual attendance of the meeting of the board of equalization to be paid out of the current expense fund of the county. However, when the county legislative authority constitutes the board they may only receive their compensation as members of the county legislative authority.
