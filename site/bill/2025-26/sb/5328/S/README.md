The director may give notice through the nationwide mortgage licensing system and registry.

3. The director may condition, suspend, or revoke a license issued under this chapter if the director finds that:

    a.

Surrender of a license applies upon approval by the director.

10. The revocation, suspension, or surrender of a license does not impair or affect the obligation of a preexisting lawful contract between the licensee and a consumer.

11. Every license issued under this chapter remains in force and effect until it has been surrendered, revoked, expired, or suspended in accordance with this chapter. However, the director may reinstate suspended or expired licenses or issue new licenses to a licensee whose license has been revoked if the director finds that the licensee meets all the requirements of this chapter.

12. A license issued under this chapter expires upon the licensee's failure to comply with the annual assessment requirements in section 9 of this act. The department must provide notice of the expiration to the address of record provided by the licensee.

## Section 14
1. No licensee may advertise, print, display, publish, distribute, or broadcast or cause or permit to be advertised, printed, displayed, published, distributed, or broadcast, in any manner whatsoever, any statement or representation with regard to the terms and conditions of employer-integrated wage access services that is false, misleading, or deceptive.

3. The director or the director's designee may seek approval and a court may issue an order under this section without prior notice to any person, including the person to whom the subpoena is directed and the person who is the subject of an investigation.
