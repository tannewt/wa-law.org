</li>
<li>
<p>Failure to comply with any directive, order, or subpoena issued by the director under this chapter.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The director may issue an order directing the licensee or other person subject to this chapter to:</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director may issue an order removing from office or prohibiting from participation in the affairs of any licensee, or both, any officer, principal, or any person subject to this chapter for:</p>
<ol type="a">

<p>False statements or omission of material information from an application for a license that, if known, would have allowed the director to deny the original application for a license;</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever the director determines that the public is likely to be substantially injured by delay in issuing a cease and desist order, the director may immediately issue a temporary cease and desist order. The order may direct the licensee to discontinue any violation of this chapter, to take such affirmative action as is necessary to comply with this chapter, and may include a summary suspension of the licensee's license and may order the licensee to immediately cease the conduct of business under this chapter. The order applies at the time specified in the order. Every temporary cease and desist order must include a provision that a hearing will be held upon request to determine whether the order will become permanent.

</li>
<li>
<p>A licensee may surrender a license by delivering to the director written notice of surrender, but the surrender does not affect the licensee's civil or criminal liability, if any, for acts committed before the surrender, including any administrative action initiated by the director to suspend or revoke a license, impose fines, compel the payment of restitution to borrowers or other persons, or exercise any other authority under this chapter. Surrender of a license applies upon approval by the director.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The revocation, suspension, or surrender of a license does not impair or affect the obligation of a preexisting lawful contract between the licensee and a consumer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every license issued under this chapter remains in force and effect until it has been surrendered, revoked, expired, or suspended in accordance with this chapter. However, the director may reinstate suspended or expired licenses or issue new licenses to a licensee whose license has been revoked if the director finds that the licensee meets all the requirements of this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A license issued under this chapter expires upon the licensee's failure to comply with the annual assessment requirements in section 9 of this act. The department must provide notice of the expiration to the address of record provided by the licensee. On the 15th day after the department provides notice, if the assessment remains unpaid, the license expires. The licensee must receive notice prior to expiration and have the opportunity to stop the expiration as set forth in rule.</p>
