</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director may issue an order removing from office or prohibiting from participation in the affairs of any licensee, or both, any officer, principal, or any person subject to this chapter for:</p>

</li>
<li>

If any person subject to this chapter makes a payment to the department under this section, the person may not advertise such payment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever the director determines that the public is likely to be substantially injured by delay in issuing a cease and desist order, the director may immediately issue a temporary cease and desist order. The order may direct the licensee to discontinue any violation of this chapter, to take such affirmative action as is necessary to comply with this chapter, and may include a summary suspension of the licensee's license and may order the licensee to immediately cease the conduct of business under this chapter. The order becomes effective at the time specified in the order. Every temporary cease and desist order must include a provision that a hearing must be held upon request to determine whether the order will become permanent. Such hearing must be held within 14 days of receipt of a request for a hearing unless otherwise specified in chapter34.05 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A licensee may surrender a license by delivering to the director written notice of surrender, but the surrender does not affect the licensee's civil or criminal liability, if any, for acts committed before the surrender, including any administrative action initiated by the director to suspend or revoke a license, impose fines, compel the payment of restitution to borrowers or other persons, or exercise any other authority under this chapter. The statute of limitations on actions not subject to RCW 4.16.160 that are brought under this chapter by the director is five years.</p>

<li>
<p>The revocation, suspension, or surrender of a license does not impair or affect the obligation of a preexisting lawful contract between the licensee and a consumer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every license issued under this chapter remains in force and effect until it has been surrendered, revoked, or suspended in accordance with this chapter. However, the director may reinstate suspended licenses or issue new licenses to a licensee whose license or licenses have been revoked if the director finds that the licensee meets all the requirements of this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A license issued under this chapter expires upon the licensee's failure to comply with the annual assessment requirements in section 7 of this act. The department must provide notice of the expiration to the address of record provided by the licensee. On the 15th day after the department provides notice, if the assessment remains unpaid, the license expires. The licensee must receive notice before expiration and have the opportunity to stop the expiration as set forth in rule.</p>
