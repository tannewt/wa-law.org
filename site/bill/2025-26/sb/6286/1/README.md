If the private detention facility continues to prevent access to the department for inspection after 30 days, the department may fine the private detention facility up to $10,000 per day for the next 30 days. If the private detention facility continues to prevent access to the department for inspection after 60 days, the department may fine the private detention facility up to $15,000 per day until access is granted to the department to allow for inspection as permitted in this chapter. Moneys collected under this section must be deposited into the federal enforcement accountability and community repair account.
