<p>In any case in which the department attempts to inspect a private detention facility and is prevented by the private detention facility from entry to conduct an inspection, the private detention facility violates this chapter, and the department, in accordance with the authority under RCW 43.70.095, may assess a civil fine of up to $1,000 per day for the first 30 days from the department's initial attempt to inspect. If the private detention facility continues to prevent access to the department for inspection after 30 days have elapsed from the department's initial attempt to inspect, the department may fine the private detention facility up to $10,000 per day for the next 30 days during which the private detention facility continues to prevent access. If the private detention facility continues to prevent access to the department for inspection after 60 days from the department's initial attempt to inspect, the department may fine the private detention facility up to $15,000 per day until access is granted to the department to allow for inspection as permitted in this chapter. Moneys collected under this section must be deposited into the enforcement accountability and community repair account.</p>
