[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5420.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that service to our nation is a selfless sacrifice carried out by members of the armed forces, uniformed services, and their families.

Therefore, the legislature finds that members of the uniformed services should be afforded the same benefits and opportunities when choosing to continue public service employment in Washington state.

The legislature further recognizes the need to support employment opportunities for veterans, who served at any time in our nation's history and obtained a qualifying discharge, and spouses who support our current active duty force by allowing for hiring preference.
