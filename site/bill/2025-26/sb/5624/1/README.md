    a. The response from law enforcement, fire agencies, and other first responders to electric vehicles involved in a collision or fire; and

    b. Transporting, towing, and storing electric vehicles involved in a collision or fire.

2. The Washington state patrol, through the director of fire protection, must develop best practice checklists to promote interagency coordination during responses to electric vehicle fires.
