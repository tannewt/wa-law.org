<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that students and communities benefit from school boards of directors that reflect the diversity of the communities and neighborhoods they serve. The legislature further recognizes that electing school directors from designated director districts promotes greater diversity on school boards. Therefore, the legislature intends to require all school districts with enrollments of 2,000 students or more to elect school board directors from designated director districts.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>

<p>The board of directors of every ‑second-class school district which is not divided into directors' districts may submit to the voters at any regular school district election a proposition to authorize the board of directors to divide the district into directors' districts  or a combination of no fewer than three director districts and no more than two at large positions. If a majority of the votes cast on the proposition is affirmative, the board of directors shall proceed to divide the district into directors' districts following the procedure established in RCW 29A.76.010.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Director districts established in accordance with this section may not become effective until the next regular school election after the redistricting plan has been approved, at which time a new five member board of directors shall be elected.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>If approval of a majority of those registered voters voting in said election is acquired, at the expiration of terms of the incumbent directors of such school district their successors shall be elected in the manner approved.</p>
