<p>The United States forest service has several options for shared management of federal public lands. However, some of these options were not structured to include revenue sharing agreements. Counties are often given authority to join in these shared stewardship agreements, but do not always have the opportunity to receive proceeds from the work that they do. The legislature finds that counties should also be able to engage with the federal government to manage forestlands for wildfire prevention and wildfire risk management, as well as to aid the counties in receiving revenue to address lost revenues from timber sales and the loss of revenue for rural schools. The legislature finds that the counties may choose to manage lands near roads on federal land as fuel breaks and as an additional revenue source.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>The board of county commissioners of each county, in relation to roads and bridges, shall have the power and it shall be its duty to:</p>
<ol>
