<ol>
<li>
<p>It is in the public interest to reduce domestic violence, sexual assault,  stalking, and hate crime by enabling victims to maintain the financial independence necessary to leave abusive situations, achieve safety, and minimize physical and emotional injuries, and to reduce the devastating economic consequences of domestic violence, sexual assault,  stalking, and hate crime to employers and employees. Victims of domestic violence, sexual assault,  stalking, or hate crime should be able to recover from and cope with the effects of such violence and participate in criminal and civil justice processes without fear of adverse economic consequences. Victims of domestic violence, sexual assault,  stalking, or hate crime should also be able to seek and maintain employment without fear that they will face discrimination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the best predictors of whether a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault,  stalking, or hate crime will be able to stay away from an abuser is the victim's degree of economic independence. However, domestic violence, sexual assault,  stalking, and hate crime often negatively impact victims' ability to maintain employment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault,  stalking, or hate crime, or an employee whose family member is a victim, must often take leave from work due to injuries, court proceedings, or safety concerns requiring legal protection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus, it is in the public interest to provide reasonable leave from employment for employees who are victims of domestic violence, sexual assault,  stalking, or hate crime, or for employees whose family members are victims, to participate in legal proceedings, receive medical treatment, or obtain other necessary services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also in the public interest to ensure that victims of domestic violence, sexual assault,  stalking, or hate crime are able to seek and maintain employment without fear of discrimination and to have reasonable safety accommodations in the workplace.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>As a condition of taking leave for any purpose described in RCW 49.76.030, an employee shall give an employer advance notice of the employee's intention to take leave. The timing of the notice shall be consistent with the employer's stated policy for requesting such leave, if the employer has such a policy. When advance notice cannot be given because of an emergency or unforeseen circumstances due to domestic violence, sexual assault,  stalking, or hate crime, the employee or the employee's designee must give notice to the employer no later than the end of the first day that the employee takes such leave.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When an employee requests leave under RCW 49.76.030 or requests a reasonable safety accommodation under RCW 49.76.115 the employer may require that the request be supported by verification that:</p>

<li>
<p>If an employer requires verification, verification must be provided in a timely manner. In the event that advance notice of the leave cannot be given because of an emergency or unforeseen circumstances due to domestic violence, sexual assault,  stalking, or hate crime, and the employer requires verification, verification must be provided to the employer within a reasonable time period during or after the leave.</p>

The provision of documentation under this section does not waive or diminish the confidential or privileged nature of communications between a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault,  stalking, or hate crime with one or more of the individuals named in this subsection (4)(c) pursuant to RCW 5.60.060, 70.123.075, 70.123.076, or 70.125.065; or</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the victim of domestic violence, sexual assault,  stalking, or hate crime is the employee's family member, verification of the familial relationship between the employee and the victim may include, but is not limited to, a statement from the employee, a birth certificate, a court document, or other similar documentation.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>To have access to immediate medical assistance and not to be detained for an unreasonable length of time by a law enforcement agency before having such assistance administered.
