<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that many Washingtonians over 55 years of age choose to live in communities specifically designed for, and marketed to, seniors who wish to live independently in a community of their peers. These senior independent living housing options are often composed of renters or individuals entering into long-term contracts, such as in continuing care retirement communities. As such, residents of these communities are unable to reasonably move should they have a conflict with management. Further, these seniors do not have access to ombuds services because the long-term care ombuds do not have jurisdiction over senior independent living.</p>
<p>As such, the legislature will create senior independent living ombuds who will track data on the types of complaints and identified resolutions and specialize in landlord-tenant and consumer protection advocacy to assist seniors living in these kinds of housing arrangements with issues that may arise.</p>
