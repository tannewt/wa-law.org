# SB 5964 - Independent living ombuds

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5964.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that many Washingtonians over 55 years of age choose to live in communities specifically designed for, and marketed to, seniors who wish to live independently in a community of their peers. These senior independent living housing options are often composed of renters or individuals entering into long-term contracts, such as in continuing care retirement communities. As such, residents of these communities are unable to reasonably move should they have a conflict with management. Further, these seniors do not have access to ombuds services because the long-term care ombuds do not have jurisdiction over senior independent living.

As such, the legislature will create senior independent living ombuds who will track data on the types of complaints and identified resolutions and specialize in landlord-tenant and consumer protection advocacy to assist seniors living in these kinds of housing arrangements with issues that may arise.

## Section 2
1. As used in this chapter, "senior independent living" means any of the following:

    a. An apartment building, condominium, or residential neighborhood that:

        i. Limits residents based on age;

        ii. Requires residents to rent the housing unit, rent the land on which they live, or both; and

        iii. Is not a long-term care facility as defined in RCW 43.190.020;

    b. Any section or portion of a continuing care retirement community, as defined in RCW 18.390.010, which is not licensed by the department of social and health services;

    c. Any portion or room in a building approved for assisted living services, as defined in RCW 74.39A.009, that is not actively being used as an assisted living facility room.

2. "Senior independent living" does not include a facility that provides medical care or assistance with activities of daily living, such as an assisted living facility, a nursing home, a long-term care facility, or other similar living arrangement that is not licensed or certified by the department of social and health services.

## Section 3

The department of commerce shall contract with a private nonprofit organization to provide senior independent living ombuds services as specified by the state and the needs of its residents. The department of commerce shall ensure all program and staff support necessary to enable the ombuds to effectively protect the interest of residents and their families is provided by the nonprofit organization that contracts to provide senior independent living ombuds services.

    a. Full or partial ownership of a senior independent living community; or
