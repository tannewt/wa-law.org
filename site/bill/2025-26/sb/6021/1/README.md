# SB 6021 - Green Hill school contraband

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6021.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that a body scanner pilot program in the department of corrections was highly successful at mitigating the introduction of contraband to adult corrections facilities. The department of corrections body scanner pilot program led to the detection of suboxone strips and pills, methamphetamine, prescription pills, fentanyl soaked marijuana, and THC gummies. Between 2019 and 2023, the program led to the confiscation of nearly 1,000 unique items, over 43 grams of drugs, and over $100 in cash.

The legislature further finds that such a program would reduce the introduction of contraband to Green Hill school and would promote a safer, drug-free facility. Contraband continues to be a serious threat to the safety and security of Green Hill school. In 2023, a joint narcotics enforcement team collected 114 bags of contraband from within Green Hill school. Among the contraband were cell phones, vape pens, gummies, and heroin.

Since then, problems with contraband have persisted at Green Hill school with employees and former employees continuing to introduce contraband into the facility. The introduction of contraband into Green Hill school severely impacts the ability of the department of children, youth, and families to engage in rehabilitative programming and harms both inmates and staff.

## Section 2

An inmate with a body scan indicating the presence of substance-related contraband shall undergo, if appropriate, a comprehensive assessment for substance use disorder and receive relevant substance use disorder treatment services, including medication-assisted treatment. The department shall prioritize substance use disorder treatment services for inmates with cognitive, behavioral, and physiological symptoms indicating the inmate is experiencing a substance use disorder.
