<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington continues to experience a shortage of homes affordable to its residents at all income levels. The legislature further finds that zoning reforms can support an environment that expands opportunities for housing development.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, any city that is required or chooses to plan under RCW 36.70A.040 with a population of 30,000 or more, as determined by the office of financial management under RCW 43.62.030, or any county that is required or chooses to plan under RCW 36.70A.040 that is not defined as a rural county under RCW 43.160.020, is prohibited from excluding residential uses in areas zoned for commercial or mixed-use development.</p>

<p>A city or county may require mixed use or ground floor commercial in up to 20 percent of the total area within its jurisdiction, unless the project is publicly subsidized affordable housing.</p>
</li>
<li>
