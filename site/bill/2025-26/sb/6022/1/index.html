<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that statewide policies collectively known as &quot;JR-25&quot; have failed to provide rehabilitation to young adults and have contributed to the overpopulation crisis in the juvenile rehabilitation administration. Additionally, these policies have also contributed to increases in violence at Green Hill School, increases in contraband, and inappropriate contact between staff and incarcerated individuals.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that as Washington's budget crisis continues, the yearly cost of rehabilitating offenders within the department of children, youth, and families is nearly four times the cost of rehabilitating offenders within the department of corrections. The legislature recognizes that the average cost per incarcerated individual at the department of corrections is approximately $76,000. By comparison, the average cost per incarcerated individual at the department of children, youth, and families is approximately $257,000.</p>
<p>Because of the detrimental impact that the JR-25 policy has had on Washington state and incarcerated youth, the legislature hereby repeals these collective policies.</p>

<p>NOTE: References in the grid to days or weeks mean periods of confinement. &quot;LS&quot; means &quot;local sanctions&quot; as defined in RCW 13.40.020.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The vertical axis of the grid is the current offense category. The current offense category is determined by the offense of adjudication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The horizontal axis of the grid is the number of prior adjudications included in the juvenile's criminal history. Each prior felony adjudication shall count as one point. Each prior violation, misdemeanor, and gross misdemeanor adjudication shall count as 1/4 point. Fractional points shall be rounded down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The standard range disposition for each offense is determined by the intersection of the column defined by the prior adjudications and the row defined by the current offense category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RCW 13.40.180 applies if the offender is being sentenced for more than one offense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A current offense that is a violation is equivalent to an offense category of E. However, a disposition for a violation shall not include confinement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the offender is subject to a standard range disposition involving confinement by the department, the court may impose the standard range and suspend the disposition on condition that the offender comply with one or more local sanctions and any educational or treatment requirement. The treatment programs provided to the offender must be either research-based best practice programs as identified by the Washington state institute for public policy or the joint legislative audit and review committee, or for chemical dependency treatment programs or services, they must be evidence-based or research-based best practice programs. For the purposes of this subsection:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Evidence-based&quot; means a program or practice that has had multiple site random controlled trials across heterogeneous populations demonstrating that the program or practice is effective for the population; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Research-based&quot; means a program or practice that has some research demonstrating effectiveness, but that does not yet meet the standard of evidence-based practices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the offender fails to comply with the suspended disposition, the court may impose sanctions pursuant to RCW 13.40.200 or may revoke the suspended disposition and order the disposition's execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An offender is ineligible for the suspended disposition option under this section if the offender is:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Adjudicated of an A+  offense;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>14 years of age or older and is adjudicated of one or more of the following offenses:</p>
