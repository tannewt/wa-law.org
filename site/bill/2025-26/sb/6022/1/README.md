# SB 6022 - Improving juvenile rehabilitation.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6022.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that statewide policies collectively known as "JR-25" have failed to provide rehabilitation to young adults and have contributed to the overpopulation crisis in the juvenile rehabilitation administration. Additionally, these policies have also contributed to increases in violence at Green Hill School, increases in contraband, and inappropriate contact between staff and incarcerated individuals.

The legislature further finds that as Washington's budget crisis continues, the yearly cost of rehabilitating offenders within the department of children, youth, and families is nearly four times the cost of rehabilitating offenders within the department of corrections. The legislature recognizes that the average cost per incarcerated individual at the department of corrections is approximately $76,000. By comparison, the average cost per incarcerated individual at the department of children, youth, and families is approximately $257,000.

Because of the detrimental impact that the JR-25 policy has had on Washington state and incarcerated youth, the legislature hereby repeals these collective policies.

ADJUDICATIONS

NOTE: References in the grid to days or weeks mean periods of confinement. "LS" means "local sanctions" as defined in RCW 13.40.020.

1. The vertical axis of the grid is the current offense category. The current offense category is determined by the offense of adjudication.

2. The horizontal axis of the grid is the number of prior adjudications included in the juvenile's criminal history. Each prior felony adjudication shall count as one point. Each prior violation, misdemeanor, and gross misdemeanor adjudication shall count as 1/4 point. Fractional points shall be rounded down.

3. The standard range disposition for each offense is determined by the intersection of the column defined by the prior adjudications and the row defined by the current offense category.

4. RCW 13.40.180 applies if the offender is being sentenced for more than one offense.

5. A current offense that is a violation is equivalent to an offense category of E. However, a disposition for a violation shall not include confinement.

1. If the offender is subject to a standard range disposition involving confinement by the department, the court may impose the standard range and suspend the disposition on condition that the offender comply with one or more local sanctions and any educational or treatment requirement. The treatment programs provided to the offender must be either research-based best practice programs as identified by the Washington state institute for public policy or the joint legislative audit and review committee, or for chemical dependency treatment programs or services, they must be evidence-based or research-based best practice programs. For the purposes of this subsection:

    a. "Evidence-based" means a program or practice that has had multiple site random controlled trials across heterogeneous populations demonstrating that the program or practice is effective for the population; and

    b. "Research-based" means a program or practice that has some research demonstrating effectiveness, but that does not yet meet the standard of evidence-based practices.

2. If the offender fails to comply with the suspended disposition, the court may impose sanctions pursuant to RCW 13.40.200 or may revoke the suspended disposition and order the disposition's execution.

3. An offender is ineligible for the suspended disposition option under this section if the offender is:

    a. Adjudicated of an A+  offense;

    b. 14 years of age or older and is adjudicated of one or more of the following offenses:

        i. A class A offense, or an attempt, conspiracy, or solicitation to commit a class A offense;

        ii. Manslaughter in the first degree (RCW 9A.32.060); or

        iii. Assault in the second degree (RCW 9A.36.021), extortion in the first degree (RCW 9A.56.120), kidnapping in the second degree (RCW 9A.40.030), robbery in the second degree (RCW 9A.56.210), residential burglary (RCW 9A.52.025), burglary in the second degree (RCW 9A.52.030), drive-by shooting (RCW 9A.36.045), vehicular homicide (RCW 46.61.520), hit and run death (RCW 46.52.020(4)(a)), intimidating a witness (RCW 9A.72.110), violation of the uniform controlled substances act (RCW 69.50.401(2) (a) and (b)), or manslaughter 2 (RCW 9A.32.070) when the offense includes infliction of bodily harm upon another or when, during the commission or immediate withdrawal from the offense, the respondent was armed with a deadly weapon;

    c. Ordered to serve a disposition for a firearm violation under RCW 13.40.193; or

    d. Adjudicated of a sex offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030

.

If the juvenile offender is subject to a standard range disposition of local sanctions or 15 to 36 weeks of confinement and has not committed an A- or B+ offense, the court may impose a disposition under RCW 13.40.160(4) and 13.40.165.

If the court determines that a disposition under option A, B, or C would effectuate a manifest injustice, the court shall impose a disposition outside the standard range under RCW 13.40.160(2).

## Section 4
1. Discretionary decline hearing - The prosecutor, respondent, or the court on its own motion may, before a hearing on the information on its merits, file a motion requesting the court to transfer the respondent for adult criminal prosecution and the matter shall be set for a hearing on the question of declining jurisdiction

.

2. Mandatory decline hearing - Unless waived by the court, the parties, and their counsel, a decline hearing shall be held when :

    a. The respondent is 16 or 17 years of age and the information alleges a class A felony or an attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy to commit a class A felony;

    b. The respondent is 17 years of age and the information alleges assault in the second degree, extortion in the first degree, indecent liberties, child molestation in the second degree, kidnapping in the second degree, or robbery in the second degree; or

    c. The information alleges an escape by the respondent and the respondent is serving a minimum juvenile sentence to age 21.

3. The court after a decline hearing may order the case transferred for adult criminal prosecution upon a finding that the declination would be in the best interest of the juvenile or the public. The court shall consider the relevant reports, facts, opinions, and arguments presented by the parties and their counsel.

4. When the respondent is transferred for criminal prosecution or retained for prosecution in juvenile court, the court shall set forth in writing its finding which shall be supported by relevant facts and opinions produced at the hearing.

## Section 5
1. If a respondent is found to have been in possession of a firearm in violation of RCW 9.41.040(2)(a)(v), the court shall impose a minimum disposition of ten days of confinement. If the offender's standard range of disposition for the offense as indicated in RCW 13.40.0357 is more than thirty days of confinement, the court shall commit the offender to the department for the standard range disposition. The offender shall not be released until the offender has served a minimum of ten days in confinement.

2. [Empty]

    a. If a respondent is found to have been in possession of a firearm in violation of RCW 9.41.040, the disposition must include a requirement that the respondent participate in a qualifying program as described in (b) of this subsection, when available, unless the court makes a written finding based on the outcome of the juvenile court risk assessment that participation in a qualifying program would not be appropriate.

    b. For purposes of this section, "qualifying program" means an aggression replacement training program, a functional family therapy program, or another program applicable to the juvenile firearm offender population that has been identified as evidence-based or research-based and cost-beneficial in the current list prepared at the direction of the legislature by the Washington state institute for public policy.

3. If the court finds that the respondent or an accomplice was armed with a firearm, the court shall determine the standard range disposition for the offense pursuant to RCW 13.40.160. If the offender or an accomplice was armed with a firearm when the offender committed any felony other than possession of a machine gun or bump-fire stock, possession of a stolen firearm, drive-by shooting, theft of a firearm, unlawful possession of a firearm in the first and second degree, or use of a machine gun or bump-fire stock in a felony, the following periods of total confinement must be added to the sentence: For a class A felony, six months; for a class B felony, four months; and for a class C felony, two months. The additional time shall be imposed regardless of the offense's juvenile disposition offense category as designated in RCW 13.40.0357.

4.

When a disposition under this section would effectuate a manifest injustice, the court may impose another disposition. When a judge finds a manifest injustice and imposes a disposition of confinement exceeding thirty days, the court shall commit the juvenile to a maximum term, and the provisions of RCW 13.40.030(2) shall be used to determine the range. When a judge finds a manifest injustice and imposes a disposition of confinement less than thirty days, the disposition shall be comprised of confinement or community supervision or both.

5. Any term of confinement ordered pursuant to this section shall run consecutively to any term of confinement imposed in the same disposition for other offenses.

## Section 6
1. In no case may a juvenile offender  be committed by the juvenile court to the department for placement in a juvenile rehabilitation facility beyond the juvenile offender's 21st birthday.

2. [Empty]

    a. The juvenile court has jurisdiction over, and may place an individual under the authority of the department in the following circumstances:

        i. Except as provided under RCW 13.04.030 and 13.40.110, when the individual is under the age of 21 at the time of the filing of the information and is accused of committing a criminal offense that occurred when the individual was under the age of 18; or

        ii. If proceedings are pending in a case in which jurisdiction is vested in the adult criminal court pursuant to RCW 13.04.030 and an automatic extension is required because either:

(A) The individual is found not guilty of the charge for which he or she was transferred, or is convicted in the adult criminal court of an offense that is not also an offense listed in RCW 13.04.030(1)(e)(v), and the matter is transferred to juvenile court pursuant to RCW 13.04.030(1)(e)(v)(E)(II); or

(B) The parties agree to juvenile court jurisdiction with the court's approval pursuant to RCW 13.04.030(1)(e)(v)(E)(III).

    b. Upon a finding of guilt in juvenile court, the juvenile court maintains jurisdiction to allow for imposition, execution, and enforcement of the court's order of disposition, subject to the limitations in this section.

    c. If an order of disposition imposes commitment to the department, then jurisdiction is automatically extended to include a period of up to 12 months of parole, in no case extending beyond the offender's 21st birthday.

3. If the juvenile court previously has extended jurisdiction beyond the juvenile offender's 18th birthday and that period of extension has not expired, the court may further extend jurisdiction by written order setting forth its reasons.

4. In no event may the juvenile court have authority to extend jurisdiction over any juvenile offender beyond the juvenile offender's 21st birthday except for the purpose of enforcing an order of restitution or penalty assessment.

5. Notwithstanding any extension of jurisdiction over a person pursuant to this section, the juvenile court has no jurisdiction over any offenses alleged to have been committed by a person 18 years of age or older.

## Section 7
1. Whenever any person is convicted as an adult in the courts of this state of a felony offense committed under the age of 18, and is committed for a term of confinement, that person shall be initially placed in a facility operated by the department of corrections to determine the person's earned release date.

    a. If the earned release date is prior to the person's 21st birthday, the department of corrections shall transfer the person to the custody of the department of children, youth, and families, or to such other institution as is now or may hereafter be authorized by law to receive such person, until such time as the person completes the ordered term of confinement or arrives at the age of 21 years.

        i. While in the custody of the department of children, youth, and families, the person must have the same treatment, housing options, transfer, and access to program resources as any other person committed to that juvenile correctional facility or institution pursuant to chapter 13.40 RCW. Treatment, placement, and program decisions shall be at the sole discretion of the department of children, youth, and families. The person shall only be transferred to the custody of the department of corrections with the approval of the department of children, youth, and families or when the person reaches the age of 21.

        ii. If the person's sentence includes a term of community custody, the department of children, youth, and families shall not release the person to community custody until the department of corrections has approved the person's release plan pursuant to RCW 9.94A.729(5)(b). If a person is held past their earned release date pending release plan approval, the department of children, youth, and families shall retain custody until a plan is approved or the person completes the ordered term of confinement prior to age 21.

        iii. If the department of children, youth, and families determines that retaining custody of the person in a facility of the department of children, youth, and families presents a  safety risk, the department of children, youth, and families may transfer and return the person to the custody of the department of corrections.

    b. If the person's earned release date is on or after the person's 21st birthday, the department of corrections shall, with the consent of the secretary of the department of children, youth, and families, transfer the person to a facility or institution operated by the department of children, youth, and families. Despite the transfer, the department of corrections retains authority over custody decisions  and must approve any leave from the facility. When the person turns age 21, the person must be transferred back to the department of corrections. The department of children, youth, and families has all routine and day-to-day operations authority for the person while the person is in its custody.

2. [Empty]

    a. Except as provided in (b) and (c) of this subsection, a person under the age of 18 convicted in adult criminal court and who is committed to a term of confinement at the department of corrections must be placed in a housing unit, or a portion of a housing unit, that is separated from offenders who are 18 years of age or older, until the person reaches the age of 18.

    b. An offender who  reaches 18 years of age may remain in a housing unit for offenders under the age of 18 if the secretary of corrections determines that: (i) The offender's needs and the correctional goals for the offender could continue to be better met by the programs and housing environment that is separate from offenders who are 18 years of age and older; and (ii) the programs or housing environment for offenders under the age of 18 will not be substantially affected by the continued placement of the offender in that environment. The offender may remain placed in a housing unit for offenders under the age of 18 until such time as the secretary of corrections determines that the offender's needs and correctional goals are no longer better met in that environment but in no case past the offender's 21st birthday.

    c. An offender who is under the age of 18 may be housed in an intensive management unit or administrative segregation unit containing offenders 18 years of age or older if it is necessary for the safety or security of the offender or staff. In these cases, the offender must be kept physically separate from other offenders at all times.
