# SB 5395 - Prior authorization/health

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5395-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that health insurance carriers, health plans, and managed care organizations are the decision makers for the type and level of care covered for an enrollee's health care benefits and are not responsible for determining or altering an enrollee's diagnosis or treatment plan. It is not always transparent who the decision maker is or how decisions are made in determining enrollee coverage for treatment, prescription drugs, or services. Artificial intelligence is being increasingly utilized by carriers, health plans, and managed care organizations to make or aid in decisions about medical necessity and coverage of provider-recommended treatment.

2. It is the intent of the legislature to increase transparency in the prior authorization process for health care coverage decisions and to ensure licensed physicians and licensed health professionals remain responsible for making determinations about coverage for treatment, prescription drugs, and services that are medically necessary. If artificial intelligence is used to aid in the decision-making process, standards must be put in place to ensure artificial intelligence is not used to make inappropriate determinations that could impact the health of an enrollee.

## Section 2
1. Each carrier offering a health plan issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2024, shall comply with the following standards related to prior authorization for health care services and prescription drugs:

    a. The carrier shall meet the following time frames for prior authorization determinations and notifications to a participating provider or facility that submits the prior authorization request through an electronic prior authorization process, as designated by each carrier:

        i. For electronic standard prior authorization requests, the carrier shall make a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of the decision within three calendar days, excluding holidays, of submission of an electronic prior authorization request by the provider or facility that contains the necessary information to make a determination. If insufficient information has been provided to the carrier to make a decision, the carrier shall request any additional information from the provider or facility within one calendar day of submission of the electronic prior authorization request.

        ii. For electronic expedited prior authorization requests, the carrier shall make a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of the decision within one calendar day of submission of an electronic prior authorization request by the provider or facility that contains the necessary information to make a determination. If insufficient information has been provided to the carrier to make a decision, the carrier shall request any additional information from the provider or facility within one calendar day of submission of the electronic prior authorization request.

    b. The carrier shall meet the following time frames for prior authorization determinations and notifications to a participating provider or facility that submits the prior authorization request through a process other than an electronic prior authorization process:

        i. For nonelectronic standard prior authorization requests, the carrier shall make a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of the decision within five calendar days of submission of a nonelectronic prior authorization request by the provider or facility that contains the necessary information to make a determination. If insufficient information has been provided to the carrier to make a decision, the carrier shall request any additional information from the provider or facility within five calendar days of submission of the nonelectronic prior authorization request.

        ii. For nonelectronic expedited prior authorization requests, the carrier shall make a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of the decision within two calendar days of submission of a nonelectronic prior authorization request by the provider or facility that contains the necessary information to make a determination. If insufficient information has been provided to the carrier to make a decision, the carrier shall request any additional information from the provider or facility within one calendar day of submission of the nonelectronic prior authorization request.

    c. In any instance in which a carrier has determined that a provider or facility has not provided sufficient information for making a determination under (a) and (b) of this subsection, a carrier may establish a specific reasonable time frame for submission of the additional information. This time frame must be communicated to the provider and enrollee with a carrier's request for additional information.

    d. The carrier's prior authorization requirements must be described in detail and written in easily understandable language. The carrier shall make its most current prior authorization requirements and restrictions, including the written clinical review criteria, available to providers and facilities in an electronic format upon request. The prior authorization requirements must be based on peer-reviewed clinical review criteria. The clinical review criteria must be evidence-based criteria and must accommodate new and emerging information related to the appropriateness of clinical criteria with respect to black and indigenous people, other people of color, gender, and underserved populations. The clinical review criteria must be evaluated and updated, if necessary, at least annually.

    e. When denying a prior authorization determination, the carrier shall include the credentials, board certifications, and areas of specialty expertise and training of the provider who had clinical oversight over the determination in any notification sent to the health plan enrollee and provider requesting or referring the service.

2. [Empty]

    a. Carriers maintain the ability to make adjustments to policies and procedures that impact the applicability of their prior authorization requirements. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, beginning August 1, 2025, new application of prior authorization for health care services or prescription drugs can only be made quarterly and go into effect either January 1st, April 1st, July 1st, or October 1st of any given calendar year. Notification of policy changes must be provided to all in-network providers at least 45 days prior to the quarterly update and must be available to providers on the electronic prior authorization system or application programming interface system. Until January 1, 2028, this information must also be provided in a single location on the carrier's website. The notification must be provided independent of other policy changes or provider notification publications and be easily accessible in electronic provider and enrollee portals.

    b. Adjustments to policies and procedures that impact the applicability of prior authorization requirements to reflect new evidence for health care services or prescription drugs including nationally recognized standards of care that are publicly available, consensus guidelines of nonprofit health care provider professional associations, nationally recognized clinical practice guidelines that are publicly available, guidelines or recommendations of federal government agencies including federal food and drug administration approvals, or state or national public health emergencies may be made at any time. Notification of adjustments made under this subsection must be provided to all in-network providers as soon as possible and must be available to providers on the electronic prior authorization system or application programming interface system. Until January 1, 2028, this information must also be provided in a single location on the carrier's website referenced in (a) of this subsection. Carriers may remove prior authorization requirements at any time.

3. [Empty]

    a. Only a licensed physician or a licensed health professional working within their scope of practice may deny a prior authorization request based on medical necessity. The licensed physician or licensed health professional shall evaluate the specific clinical issues involved in the health care services requested by the requesting provider by reviewing and considering the requesting provider's recommendation, the enrollee's medical or other clinical history, as applicable, and individual clinical circumstances. Artificial intelligence shall not be the sole means used to deny, delay, or modify health care services. Algorithms may be used to process and approve prior authorization requests, but may not be used without human review to deny care based on a determination of medical necessity.

    b. A carrier that uses artificial intelligence for the purpose of prior authorization or prior authorization functions, based in whole or in part on medical necessity, or that contracts with or otherwise works through an entity that uses artificial intelligence for the purpose of prior authorization or prior authorization functions, based in whole or in part on medical necessity, shall ensure all of the following:

        i. The artificial intelligence bases its determination on the following information, as applicable:

(A) An enrollee's medical or other clinical history, including demographic data; and

(B) Individual clinical circumstances as presented by the requesting provider;

        ii. The artificial intelligence does not base its determination solely on a group data set;

        iii. The artificial intelligence's criteria and guidelines comply with this chapter and applicable state and federal law;

        iv. The use of the artificial intelligence does not discriminate, directly or indirectly, against an enrollee in violation of state or federal law;

    v. The artificial intelligence is fairly and equitably applied, including in accordance with any applicable regulations and guidance issued by the federal department of health and human services;

    vi. The policies and procedures for using artificial intelligence are open to audit by the office of the insurance commissioner under chapter 48.37 RCW;

    vii. The artificial intelligence's performance, use, and outcomes are periodically reviewed by the carrier to maximize accuracy and reliability; and

    viii. Patient data is not used beyond its intended and stated purpose, consistent with chapter 70.02 RCW and the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1320d et al., as applicable.

4. [Empty]

    a. Each carrier shall build and maintain a prior authorization application programming interface that automates the process for in-network providers to determine whether a prior authorization is required for health care services, identify prior authorization information and documentation requirements, and facilitate the exchange of prior authorization requests and determinations from its electronic health records or practice management system. The application programming interface must support the exchange of prior authorization requests and determinations for health care services beginning January 1, 2025, and must:

        i. Use health level 7 fast health care interoperability resources in accordance with standards and provisions defined in 45 C.F.R. Sec. 170.215 and 45 C.F.R. Sec. 156.22(3)(b);

    v. Indicate that a prior authorization denial or authorization of a service less intensive than that included in the original request is an adverse benefit determination and is subject to the carrier's grievance and appeal process under RCW 48.43.535.

    b. Each carrier shall establish and maintain an interoperable electronic process or application programming interface that automates the process for in-network providers to determine whether a prior authorization is required for a covered prescription drug. The application programming interface must support the exchange of prior authorization requests and determinations for prescription drugs, including information on covered alternative prescription drugs, beginning January 1, 2027, and must:

        i. Allow providers to identify prior authorization information and documentation requirements;

        ii. Facilitate the exchange of prior authorization requests and determinations from its electronic health records or practice management system, and may include the necessary data elements to populate the prior authorization requirements that are compliant with the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or have an exception from the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services; and

        iii. Indicate that a prior authorization denial or authorization of a drug other than the one included in the original prior authorization request is an adverse benefit determination and is subject to the carrier's grievance and appeal process under RCW 48.43.535.

    c. If federal rules related to standards for using an application programming interface to communicate prior authorization status to providers are not finalized by the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services by September 13, 2023, the requirements of (a) of this subsection may not be enforced until January 1, 2026.

(D) A timeline and implementation plan to achieve compliance with the requirements.

        ii. The commissioner may grant a one-year delay in enforcement of the requirements of (a) of this subsection (4) if the commissioner determines that the carrier has made a good faith effort to comply with the requirements.

        iii. This subsection (4)(d) shall not apply if the delay in enforcement in (c) of this subsection takes effect because the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services did not finalize the applicable regulations by September 13, 2023.

    e. By September 13, 2023, and at least every six months thereafter until September 13, 2026, the commissioner shall provide an update to the health care policy committees of the legislature on the development of rules and implementation guidance from the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services regarding the standards for development of application programming interfaces and interoperable electronic processes related to prior authorization functions. The updates should include recommendations, as appropriate, on whether the status of the federal rule development aligns with the provisions of chapter 382, Laws of 2023. The commissioner also shall report on any actions by the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services to exercise enforcement discretion related to the implementation and maintenance of an application programming interface for prior authorization functions.
