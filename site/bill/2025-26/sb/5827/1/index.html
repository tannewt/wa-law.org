<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that agencies may deny an applicant's request for veteran preference because the applicant is currently serving in the United States military and does not yet meet the definition of a veteran prior to the applicant's official discharge or release date from military service. The legislature further finds that some applicants are denied the preference despite receipt of an official statement of service memorandum from their commanding officer or delegated authority that includes expected discharge characterization and expected discharge or release from service date. The legislature recognizes the negative impact these actions have on active duty service members who are in the process of securing jobs prior to their separation date from service because service members generally do not receive a DD form 214 (military separation paperwork) until their last day of active service and most service members would prefer to have civilian jobs secured prior to their separation date. The legislature intends to clarify the requirements for veteran preference to ensure a smooth transition into civil employment.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>In all competitive examinations, unless otherwise provided in this section, to determine the qualifications of applicants for public offices, positions, or employment, either the state, and all of its political subdivisions and all municipal corporations, or private companies or agencies contracted with by the state to give the competitive examinations shall give a scoring criteria status to all veterans as defined in RCW 41.04.007, by adding to the passing mark, grade or rating only, based upon a possible rating of one hundred points as perfect a percentage in accordance with the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ten percent to a veteran who served during a period of war or in an armed conflict as defined in RCW 41.04.005 and does not receive military retirement. The percentage shall be added to the passing mark, grade, or rating of competitive examinations until the veteran's first appointment. The percentage shall not be utilized in promotional examinations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Five percent to a veteran who did not serve during a period of war or in an armed conflict as defined in RCW 41.04.005 or is receiving military retirement.

The percentage shall not be utilized in promotional examinations;</p>
