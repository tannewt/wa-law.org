<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that children, youth, and other individuals placed in the state's care and state-licensed facilities through juvenile rehabilitation must be protected from harm. The legislature further finds that fatality reviews provide an important tool for the public to review what improvements may be made for the safety and protection of people placed in juvenile rehabilitation. Therefore, the legislature finds that the department of children, youth, and families shall also conduct fatality reviews over any child, youth, or other individual placed in the department's care.</p>
