# SB 6018 - Housing finance commission

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6018-S.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that the commission is not intended to function as a retail mortgage lender. Nothing in this chapter authorizes the commission to compete with private financial institutions in the origination of residential mortgage loans to individual homebuyers. The authority granted in RCW 43.180.050(1)(c) is intended solely to streamline financing for multifamily and other nonowner-occupied housing while preserving the role of licensed mortgage lenders in the residential mortgage lending market.

## Section 2
It is declared to be the public policy of the state and a recognized governmental function to assist in making affordable and decent housing available throughout the state and by so doing to contribute to the general welfare. Decent housing for the people of our state is a most important public concern. Interest rates and construction costs have made it impossible for many Washington citizens to purchase their own homes. Older people, individuals with disabilities, and low and moderate-income families often cannot afford to rent decent housing. There exists throughout the state a serious shortage of safe, sanitary and energy efficient housing available at prices within the financial means of our citizens. General economic development within the state is also impeded by a lack of affordable housing. The state's economy, which is dependent on the timber, wood products, and construction industries, has been damaged by inadequate investment in housing construction and rehabilitation. The result has been high unemployment and economic hardship affecting the prosperity of all the people of the state, particularly those in the wood products industry.

It is the purpose of this chapter to establish a state housing finance commission to act as a constituted authority and financial conduit which, without  lending the credit of the state or local government, can issue nonrecourse revenue bonds and participate in federal, state, and local housing programs and thereby make additional funds available at affordable rates to help provide housing throughout the state. It is also a primary purpose of this chapter to encourage the use of Washington state forest products in residential construction. This chapter is enacted to accomplish these and related purposes and shall be liberally construed to carry out its purposes and objectives.

## Section 3
1. In addition to other powers and duties prescribed in this chapter, and in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter to provide decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing for eligible persons, the commission is empowered to:

    a. Issue bonds in accordance with this chapter;

    b. Invest in, purchase, or make commitments to purchase or take assignments from mortgage lenders of mortgages or mortgage loans;

    c. Make loans and mortgage loans, but not loans or mortgage loans for owner-occupied residential home purchases or refinancing, except as expressly authorized under (d) of this subsection;

    d. Make loans for down payment assistance to homebuyers in conjunction with other commission programs; and

    e. Participate fully in federal and other governmental programs and to take such actions as are necessary and consistent with this chapter to secure to itself and the people of the state the benefits of those programs and to meet their requirements, including such actions as the commission considers appropriate in order to have the interest payments on its bonds and other obligations treated as tax exempt under the code.

2. Except as expressly authorized under subsection (1)(d) of this section, the commission may not originate or make residential mortgage loans directly to natural persons for the purchase or refinancing of owner-occupied single-family housing.

3. The commission shall establish eligibility standards for eligible persons, considering at least the following factors:

    a. Income;

    b. Family size;

    c. Cost, condition, and energy efficiency of available residential housing;

    d. Availability of decent, safe, and sanitary housing;

    e. Age or infirmity; and

    f. Applicable federal, state, and local requirements.

4. The state auditor shall audit the books, records, and affairs of the commission annually to determine, among other things, if the use of bond proceeds complies with the general plan of housing finance objectives including compliance with the objective for the use of financing assistance for implementation of cost-effective energy efficiency measures in dwellings.

## Section 4
In addition to other powers and duties specified in this chapter, the commission may:

1.

In preparation for the disposition of the properties, the commission may own, lease, clear, construct, reconstruct, rehabilitate, repair, maintain, manage, operate, assign, or encumber the properties;

11. Take assignments of leases and rentals;

12. Subject to any provisions of the commission's contracts with the holders of obligations of the commission, consent to any modification with respect to rate of interest, time, and payment of any installment of principal or interest or any other term of any contract, mortgage, mortgage loan, mortgage loan commitment, contract, or agreement of any kind;

These regulatory agreements and covenants shall run with the land and be enforceable by the commission or its successors or assigns against the person or entity making the regulatory agreement or covenants or its successors or assigns, even though there may be no privity of estate or privity of contract between the commission or its successors or assigns and the person or entity against whom enforcement is sought. The term of any such covenant shall be set forth in the recorded agreement containing the covenant.

## Section 5
1. The commission shall adopt written policies to provide for the selection of bond counsel. The policies shall provide for the creation and maintenance of a roster of attorneys whom the commission believes possess the requisite special expertise and professional standing to provide bond counsel opinions which would be accepted by the underwriters, bondholders, and other members of the financial community, and which would be in furtherance of the public interest in obtaining the lowest possible interest rates on the bonds issued by the commission. Any attorney may apply to have his or her name placed on the roster, but may not be placed on the roster unless the attorney demonstrates to the commission's satisfaction that the attorney would issue the kind of opinions required by this section.

2. Prior to selecting an attorney or attorneys to provide bond counsel services, the commission shall provide all attorneys on the roster with a notice of its intentions to select bond counsel and shall invite each of them to submit to the commission his or her fee schedule for providing bond counsel services. The commission shall have wide discretion in selecting the attorney or attorneys it considers to be most appropriate to provide the services, but in the exercise of this discretion the commission shall consider all submitted fee schedules and the public interest in achieving both savings in bond counsel fees and issuance of bonds on terms most favorable to the commission. At least once every four calendar years, the commission shall select anew an attorney or attorneys to serve as bond counsel. However, the commission may retain an attorney for longer than four years when necessary to complete work on a particular bond issue. An attorney previously retained may be selected again but only after the commission has provided other attorneys on the roster with an opportunity to be selected and has made the fee schedule review required under this subsection. In addition to or as an alternative to retaining counsel for a period of time, the commission may appoint an attorney to serve as counsel in respect to only a particular bond issue.

## Section 6
1. The commission's bonds shall bear such date or dates, mature at such time or times, be in such denominations, be in such form, be registered or registrable in such manner, be made transferable, exchangeable, and interchangeable, be payable in such medium of payment, at such place or places, be subject to such terms of redemption, bear such fixed or variable rate or rates of interest, be payable at such time or times, and be sold in such manner and at such price or prices, as the commission determines. The bonds shall be executed by the chair, by either its duly elected secretary or its treasurer, and by the trustee or paying agent if the commission determines to use a trustee or paying agent for the bonds. Execution of the bonds may be by manual or facsimile signature.

2. The bonds of the commission shall be subject to such terms, conditions, covenants, and protective provisions as are found necessary or desirable by the commission, including, but not limited to, pledges of the commission's assets, setting aside of reserves, limitations on additional forms of indebtedness, and the mortgaging of all or any part of the commission's real or personal property, then owned or thereafter acquired, and other provisions the commission finds are necessary or desirable for the security of bondholders.

3. Any security interest created in the unexpended bond proceeds and in the special funds created by the commission shall be immediately valid and binding against such moneys and any securities in which such moneys may be invested without commission or trustee possession thereof, and the security interest shall be prior to any party having any competing claim in such moneys or securities, without filing or recording pursuant to chapter 62A.9 RCW and regardless of whether the party has notice of the security interest.

4. When issuing bonds, the commission may provide for the future issuance of additional bonds or parity debt on a parity with outstanding bonds, and the terms and conditions of their issuance. The commission may refund or advance refund any bond of the commission in accordance with chapter 39.53 RCW or issue bonds with a subordinate lien against the fund or funds securing outstanding bonds.

5.

The members of the commission and any person executing the bonds are not liable personally on the indebtedness or subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance thereof.

6. The commission may, out of any fund available therefor, purchase its bonds in the open market.
