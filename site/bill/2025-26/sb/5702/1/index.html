<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that most tolling facilities in Washington state are subject to strict bond covenants and financial requirements, requiring swift action in response to changing circumstances. However, the current process for setting or adjusting toll rates or toll rate policies takes an average of 160 days to complete due to requirements in the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW. The legislature further finds that this process lacks the flexibility that is necessary to quickly adjust tolls to meet legally mandated revenue and performance requirements in response to unforeseen circumstances. Therefore, in order to address the challenges with the current toll rate setting process, it is the intent of the legislature to exempt toll setting from the administrative procedure act and to instead establish a toll setting process that can be carried out efficiently and expeditiously while maintaining public transparency.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>

</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Unless these powers are otherwise delegated by the legislature, the transportation commission is the tolling authority for the state. The tolling authority shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Consistent with the process described in section 4 of this act, set toll rates, establish appropriate exemptions, including discounts, if any, and make adjustments as conditions warrant on eligible toll facilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review toll collection policies, toll operations policies, and toll revenue expenditures on the eligible toll facilities and report annually on this review to the legislature.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tolling authority, in determining toll rates, shall consider the policy guidelines established in RCW 47.56.830.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise directed by the legislature, in setting and periodically adjusting toll rates, the tolling authority must ensure that toll rates will generate revenue sufficient to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Meet the operating costs of the eligible toll facilities, including necessary maintenance, preservation, renewal, replacement, administration, and toll enforcement by public law enforcement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meet obligations for the timely payment of debt service on bonds issued for eligible toll facilities, and any other associated financing costs including, but not limited to, required reserves, minimum debt coverage or other appropriate contingency funding, insurance, and compliance with all other financial and other covenants made by the state in the bond proceedings;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meet obligations to reimburse the motor vehicle fund for excise taxes on motor vehicle and special fuels applied to the payment of bonds issued for eligible toll facilities; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meet any other obligations of the tolling authority to provide its proportionate share of funding contributions for any projects or operations of the eligible toll facilities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The established toll rates may include variable pricing, and should be set to optimize system performance, recognizing necessary trade-offs to generate revenue for the purposes specified in subsection (3) of this section. Tolls may vary for type of vehicle, time of day, traffic conditions, or other factors designed to improve performance of the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In fixing and adjusting toll rates under this section, the only toll revenue to be taken into account must be toll revenue pledged to bonds that includes toll receipts, and the only debt service requirements to be taken into account must be debt service on bonds payable from and secured by toll revenue that includes toll receipts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature pledges to appropriate toll revenue as necessary to carry out the purposes of this section. When the legislature has specifically identified and designated an eligible toll facility and authorized the issuance of bonds for the financing of the eligible toll facility that are payable from and secured by a pledge of toll revenue, the legislature further agrees for the benefit of the owners of outstanding bonds issued by the state for eligible toll facilities to continue in effect and not to impair or withdraw the authorization of the tolling authority to fix and adjust tolls as provided in this section. The state finance committee shall pledge the state's obligation to impose and maintain tolls, together with the application of toll revenue as described in this section, to the owners of any bonds.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When setting or adjusting toll rates on eligible toll facilities, or establishing or adjusting appropriate exemptions, including discounts, the transportation commission shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Issue written notice to the public that the commission intends to set or adjust toll rates on a given facility. At a minimum, the notice must be published on the commission's website at least 30 days before any proposed rates would take effect;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carry out a public outreach process on a possible toll rate option or options under consideration by the commission;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After review of options and public input, if any, the commission shall select the applicable toll rates and may adopt the rates as soon as needed; however, adopting toll rates is deemed to be an action as defined in RCW 42.30.020 and must occur at an open public meeting of the commission; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within one week of adopting toll rates, the commission shall notify the public and stakeholder agencies, including the department of transportation, of the toll rates, and provide the updated information on its website.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the commission determines that immediate adoption of a toll change is necessary in order to comply with the legal or financial obligations of the state including, but not limited to, state or federal law, federal rule, federal grant conditions, or the bond covenants of the state, then the commission may adopt a toll change on an emergency basis, without observing the notice and public outreach and input requirements of subsection (1) of this section. However, notice and public outreach and input requirements must be observed to the greatest extent practicable as the emergency circumstances allow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall establish administrative fees as appropriate for toll collection processes using the same process described in subsection (1) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall post all current toll rates and toll policies on its website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All open public meetings conducted under this section must include an option for the public to participate remotely through electronic means.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall adopt rules that establish further detail around the toll rate setting process and where relevant information will be provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not apply to any rule making regarding toll rate setting in progress by the commission on the effective date of this section, which shall be completed under chapter 34.05 RCW.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all photographs, digital photographs, microphotographs, videotape, other recorded images, or other records identifying a specific instance of travel prepared under this chapter are for the exclusive use of the tolling agency for toll collection and enforcement purposes and are not open to the public and may not be used in a court in a pending action or proceeding unless the action or proceeding relates to a civil penalty under RCW 46.63.160. No photograph, digital photograph, microphotograph, videotape, other recorded image, or other record identifying a specific instance of travel may be used for any purpose other than toll collection or enforcement of civil penalties under RCW 46.63.160. Records identifying a specific instance of travel by a specific person or vehicle must be retained only as required to ensure payment and enforcement of tolls and to comply with state records retention policies. Aggregate records that do not identify an individual, vehicle, or account may be maintained.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The transportation commission shall , consistent with the process described in section 4 of this act, assess administrative fees as appropriate for toll collection processes. Administrative fees must not exceed toll collection costs. All administrative fees collected under this section must be deposited into the toll facility account of the facility on which the toll was assessed.</p>

<li>
<p>Failure to pay a photo toll by the toll payment due date is a violation for which a notice of civil penalty may be issued under RCW 46.63.160.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For an electronic toll collection system that uses an in-vehicle device, such as a transponder, to identify a particular customer for the purposes of paying an electronic toll from that customer's toll collection account, the department must allow such in-vehicle devices to be offered for sale at vehicle dealers.</p>
