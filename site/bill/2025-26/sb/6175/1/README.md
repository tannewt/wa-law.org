# SB 6175 - Ticket sales

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6175.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that the ticket market for live entertainment and sporting events has become increasingly complex, leading to consumer confusion, hidden fees, and fraudulent practices. The legislature intends to protect consumers by promoting transparency and fair competition in both the primary and secondary ticket markets, while also supporting nonprofit and smaller arts and performance venues that are essential to Washington's culture and economy. The legislature further intends to safeguard artists' fair wages and the integrity of public funds by ensuring that taxpayer-supported venues and organizations, which strive to keep ticket prices affordable for their communities and honor contractual agreements with artists, are not undermined by profiteering of the secondary market.

## Section 2
This chapter does not apply to the following:

1. Agricultural fairs;

2. K-12 schools, institutions of higher education, or associated booster clubs or student organizations;

3. Nonprofit organizations or businesses whose primary purpose is the advancement or presentation of arts, culture, science, or heritage, and that have an annual gross revenue from the sale of tickets of less than $500,000;

4. Movie theaters;

5. Professional and collegiate athletic teams;

6. Federally recognized tribes; and

7. Tribal cultural institutions.

## Section 3
A ticket issuer shall not restrict the transferability of a ticket sold unless the terms and conditions on transferability are clearly and conspicuously disclosed to the consumer prior to purchase and the consumer acknowledges receipt of such disclosure prior to purchase.

## Section 4
It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a person to engage in the business of a ticket reseller or ticket resale marketplace without the written permission of the original ticket seller, or the owner or operator of the property where the event is being held, or both, if the resale transaction violates the contractual or license terms of the original ticket sale.

2. A person or secondary ticket exchange may not charge a service fee exceeding 10 percent of the initial ticket's total price to the consumer. This fee must be incorporated into the calculation of the 110 percent resale price cap established in subsection (1) of this section.

    b. That the buyer is not purchasing a ticket directly from the event venue, team, artist, original/primary ticket seller.

3. Resellers are prohibited from using the name of an artist, performer, team, or venue in the website's uniform resource locator with the intent to gain an unfair search engine optimization advantage or to mislead consumers into believing the site is an official or primary seller.

2. Any licensee who changes the business name, business address, or primary contact information must notify the department of licensing in writing within 30 days of such change.
