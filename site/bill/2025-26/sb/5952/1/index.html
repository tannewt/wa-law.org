<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature strongly believes in the importance of health and fitness instruction and a well-rounded education as it is one of the primary goals of basic education identified in RCW 28A.150.210.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature acknowledges that state law has allowed individual high school students to be excused from participating in physical education for certain reasons and good cause. The legislature further acknowledges that the waiver process from physical education requirements is based on local policy and procedure and can vary widely between school districts. The legislature finds that this variation between school districts leads to confusion and inequitable flexibility for high school students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to standardize the process for excusing high school students from participating in physical education, which will lead to more equitable access to this wavier for high school students throughout the state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>All high schools of the state shall emphasize the work of physical education, and carry into effect all physical education requirements established by rule of the superintendent of public instructionand in accordance with this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individual high school students may be excused from participating in physical education otherwise required under this section on account of physical disability, employment, or religious belief,  because of participation in directed athletics or military science and tactics, or for other good cause.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By December 1, 2026, the Washington state school directors' association, in consultation with the office of the superintendent of public instruction and the state board of education, shall develop a standardized process, including a template form, for excusing individual high school students from participating in physical education in accordance with state law. This process must be based upon addressing health and physical education learning standards and include alternative means of engaging in physical activities, as directed in RCW 28A.210.365, and mastery-based credit allowable under RCW 28A.230.090.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By August 1, 2027, school districts shall adopt the standardized process and use the form developed under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section governs school operation and management under RCW 28A.710.040 and 28A.715.020 and applies to charter schools established under chapter 28A.710 RCW and state-tribal education compact schools subject to chapter 28A.715 RCW to the same extent as it applies to school districts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is the goal of Washington state to ensure that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>By 2010, all K-12 districts have school health advisory committees that advise school administration and school board members on policies, environmental changes, and programs needed to support healthy food choice and physical activity and childhood fitness. Districts shall include school nurses or other school personnel as advisory committee members.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Not more than ten percent of its total calories shall be from saturated fat. This restriction does not apply to eggs, reduced-fat cheese, part-skim cheese, nonfat dairy products, or low-fat dairy products;</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>By 2010, all student health and fitness instruction shall be conducted by appropriately certified instructors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any district waiver or exemption policy from physical education requirements for high school students under RCW 28A.230.050 should be based upon meeting both health and fitness curricula concepts as well as alternative means of engaging in physical activity, but should acknowledge students' interest in pursuing their academic interests.</p>
</li>
