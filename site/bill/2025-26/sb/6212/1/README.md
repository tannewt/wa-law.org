# SB 6212 - Children benefit pilot prg.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6212.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that, in 2021, the United States implemented a universal child benefit for the first time in its history. Evidence from that period demonstrates that the benefit reduced child poverty by approximately 46 percent within one year and produced positive outcomes related to income inequality and childhood well-being across demographic groups. The legislature further finds that the discontinuation of this universal child benefit after one year resulted in a sharp and immediate increase in child poverty.

2. The legislature recognizes the substantial benefits that a universal child benefit can provide to children and families, including improvements in physical health and immune system strength, increased life satisfaction and overall happiness, greater resilience to stress and economic instability, improved capacity for parental work performance and productivity, and enhanced sense of stability, purpose, and well-being within households.

3. Accordingly, the legislature intends to evaluate the feasibility and impacts of a state-funded universal child benefit through the establishment of a pilot program in Washington state. The pilot program is intended to assess the effects of providing a universal child benefit to families by randomly selecting 1,000 families whose children are eligible for free or reduced-price school meals to receive the benefit.

4. The legislature intends for the department of commerce to administer the pilot program and to report to the legislature on its outcomes. The report shall include, but not be limited to, an analysis of changes in participating families' financial stability and net worth following receipt of the benefit, observed impacts on child and family well-being, and recommendations regarding the potential expansion or permanent implementation of a universal child benefit in Washington state.

Imputation of earnings at 32 hours per week under this subsection is a rebuttable presumption;

    vi. Median net monthly income of year-round full-time workers as derived from the United States bureau of census, current population reports, or such replacement report as published by the bureau of census.

    c. The refusal to admit patients who would be expected to require unusually costly or prolonged treatment for reasons other than those related to the appropriateness of the care available at the hospital.

2. No hospital shall adopt or maintain practices or policies which would deny access to emergency care based on ability to pay. No hospital which maintains an emergency department shall transfer a patient with an emergency medical condition or who is in active labor unless the transfer is performed at the request of the patient or is due to the limited medical resources of the transferring hospital. Hospitals must make transfers to other hospitals in such circumstances and as promptly as dictated by the standard of care and follow reasonable procedures in making transfers to other hospitals including confirmation of acceptance of the transfer by the receiving hospital.

3. The department shall develop definitions by rule, as appropriate, for subsection (1) of this section and, with reference to federal requirements, subsection (2) of this section. The department shall monitor hospital compliance with subsections (1) and (2) of this section. The department shall report individual instances of possible noncompliance to the state attorney general or the appropriate federal agency.

4. The department shall establish and maintain by rule, consistent with the definition of charity care in RCW 70.170.020, the following:

The policy shall include procedures for identifying patients who may be eligible for health care coverage through medical assistance programs under chapter 74.09 RCW or the Washington health benefit exchange and actively assisting patients to apply for any available coverage. If a hospital determines that a patient or their guarantor is qualified for retroactive health care coverage through the medical assistance programs under chapter 74.09 RCW, a hospital shall assist the patient or guarantor with applying for such coverage. If a hospital determines that a patient or their guarantor qualifies for retroactive health care coverage through the medical assistance programs under chapter 74.09 RCW, a hospital is not obligated to provide charity care under this section to any patient or their guarantor if the patient or their guarantor fails to make reasonable efforts to cooperate with the hospital's efforts to assist them in applying for such coverage. Hospitals may not impose application procedures for charity care or for assistance with retroactive coverage applications which place an unreasonable burden upon the patient or guarantor, taking into account any physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory deficiencies, or language barriers which may hinder the responsible party's capability of complying with application procedures. It is an unreasonable burden to require a patient to apply for any state or federal program where the patient is obviously or categorically ineligible or has been deemed ineligible in the prior 12 months.

        i. All patients and their guarantors whose income is not more than 300 percent of the federal poverty level, adjusted for family size, shall be deemed charity care patients for the full amount of the patient responsibility portion of their hospital charges;

        ii. All patients and their guarantors whose income is between 301 and 350 percent of the federal poverty level, adjusted for family size, shall be entitled to a 75 percent discount for the full amount of the patient responsibility portion of their hospital charges, which may be reduced by amounts reasonably related to assets considered pursuant to (c) of this subsection;

        iii. All patients and their guarantors whose income is between 351 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level, adjusted for family size, shall be entitled to a 50 percent discount for the full amount of the patient responsibility portion of their hospital charges, which may be reduced by amounts reasonably related to assets considered pursuant to (c) of this subsection.

    b. At a minimum, a hospital not subject to (a) of this subsection shall grant charity care per the following guidelines:

        i. All patients and their guarantors whose income is not more than 200 percent of the federal poverty level, adjusted for family size, shall be deemed charity care patients for the full amount of the patient responsibility portion of their hospital charges;

        ii. All patients and their guarantors whose income is between 201 and 250 percent of the federal poverty level, adjusted for family size, shall be entitled to a 75 percent discount for the full amount of the patient responsibility portion of their hospital charges, which may be reduced by amounts reasonably related to assets considered pursuant to (c) of this subsection; and

        iii. All patients and their guarantors whose income is between 251 and 300 percent of the federal poverty level, adjusted for family size, shall be entitled to a 50 percent discount for the full amount of the patient responsibility portion of their hospital charges, which may be reduced by amounts reasonably related to assets considered pursuant to (c) of this subsection.

    c. [Empty]

        i. If a hospital considers the existence, availability, and value of assets in order to reduce the discount extended, it must establish and make publicly available a policy on asset considerations and corresponding discount reductions.

        ii. If a hospital considers assets, the following types of assets shall be excluded from consideration:

(A) The first $5,000 of monetary assets for an individual or $8,000 of monetary assets for a family of two, and $1,500 of monetary assets for each additional family member. The value of any asset that has a penalty for early withdrawal shall be the value of the asset after the penalty has been paid;

(B) Any equity in a primary residence;

13. The department shall monitor the distribution of charity care among hospitals, with reference to factors such as relative need for charity care in hospital service areas and trends in private and public health coverage. The department shall prepare reports that identify any problems in distribution which are in contradiction of the intent of this chapter. The report shall include an assessment of the effects of the provisions of this chapter on access to hospital and health care services, as well as an evaluation of the contribution of all purchasers of care to hospital charity care.

14. The department shall issue a report on the subjects addressed in this section at least annually, with the first report due on July 1, 1990.
