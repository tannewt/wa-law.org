<ol>
<li>
<p>By January 1, 2027, the department shall develop a community-based referral pathway for high-risk families with children under the age of four where parental use of high-potency synthetic opioids is a factor in the case. The department shall initiate the community-based referral process within seven days of conducting a risk assessment that determines that the case is moderately high or high risk, including a referral to a substance use disorder assessment or treatment, if treatment is necessary. Services may begin during an investigation pursuant to RCW 26.44.030. An investigation does not need to remain open in order for a family to receive services under this section. Additionally, any services offered shall be available to the family for six months regardless of the case's status. The community-based referral process must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Facilitate a transition that connects eligible families with a community-based provider;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aim to keep children safe, support families, and increase participation in services by eligible families; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorporate a referral process to the following services when appropriate:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The plan of safe care community pathway;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peer navigators;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Behavioral health navigators;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community-based organizations;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Family resource centers;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="i" start="6">
<li>
<p>Family preservation services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community care hubs; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prefiling legal representation programs that provide access to counsel and culturally relevant, community-based social workers and parent advocates to support pregnant parents and parents of newborns.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall develop the referral process described in subsection (1) of this section in consultation with community-based service providers, network administrators as defined in RCW 74.13B.010, and support organizations including, but not limited to, those listed in subsection (1)(c) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall inform the parent, custodian, or legal guardian in writing that services offered under this section are voluntary. If the parent, custodian, or legal guardian agrees to voluntarily participate in services offered by the department under this section, the parent, guardian, or legal custodian shall sign a release of information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By November 1, 2027, and in compliance with RCW 43.01.036, the department shall submit a report to the appropriate committees of the legislature describing:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The processes developed under subsection (1) of this section; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any available and relevant data demonstrating the impact of the processes developed under subsection (1) of this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section is not intended to supersede any provisions of the Indian child welfare act, chapter 13.38 RCW.</p>
</li>
