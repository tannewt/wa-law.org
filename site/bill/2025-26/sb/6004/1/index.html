<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that surging demand for electricity and the necessity of meeting Washington's clean energy goals will require local governments and other public entities to have greater flexibility for investing in new electric generation projects. The legislature further finds that such flexibility was previously provided by the legislature, but only for a limited set of qualified alternative energy resources that no longer completely align with newer categories of clean energy resources established in the Washington clean energy transformation act. Therefore, the legislature intends to encourage the development of renewable resources and nonemitting electric generation by making it easier for various public entities to invest in such projects, which are essential to having a successful future for the electric power system in Washington.</p>
