However, any person who sells, transfers, or is displaced from his or her residence may transfer his or her exemption status to a replacement residence, but no claimant may receive an exemption on more than one residence in any year. Moreover, confinement of the person to a hospital, nursing home, assisted living facility, adult family home, or home of a relative for the purpose of long-term care does not disqualify the claim of exemption if:</p>

For purposes of this subsection, a residence owned by a marital community or state registered domestic partnership or owned by cotenants is deemed to be owned by each spouse or each domestic partner or each cotenant, and any lease for life is deemed a life estate;</p>

A disability rating from 10 percent through 29 percent may receive an exemption of up to $5,000 from the property's value, 30 percent through 49 percent may receive up to $7,500, 50 percent through 69 percent may receive up to $10,000, and 70 percent through 100 percent may receive up to $12,000.</p>

<p>A city or town that has annexed since 2006 or is conducting annexations of all or a part of a fire protection district or fire protection districts may by resolution, for the enhancement of fire protection services, fix and impose a benefit charge on personal property and improvements to real property that are located in the city or town, to be paid by the owners of the properties: PROVIDED, That a benefit charge shall not apply to personal property and improvements to real property owned or used by: (a) Any recognized religious denomination or religious organization as, or including, a sanctuary or for purposes related to the bona fide religious ministries of the denomination or religious organization, including schools and educational facilities used for kindergarten, primary, or secondary educational purposes or for institutions of higher education and all grounds and buildings related thereto, but not including personal property and improvements to real property owned or used by any recognized religious denomination or religious organization for business operations, profit-making enterprises, or activities not including use of a sanctuary or related to kindergarten, primary, or secondary educational purposes or for institutions of higher education; or (b) any entity exempt from taxation under RCW 35.82.210, 84.36.030(3), or 84.36.560.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A benefit charge imposed shall be reasonably proportioned to the measurable benefits to property resulting from the enhancement of services afforded by the city or town fire department. It is acceptable to apportion the benefit charge to the values of the properties as found by the county assessor or assessors modified generally in the proportion that fire insurance rates are reduced or entitled to be reduced as the result of providing the services. Any other method that reasonably apportions the benefit charges to the actual benefits resulting from the degree of protection, which may include but is not limited to the distance from regularly maintained fire protection equipment, the level of fire prevention services provided to the properties, or the need of the properties for specialized services, may be specified in the resolution and shall be subject to contest on the ground of unreasonable or capricious action or action in excess of the measurable benefits to the property resulting from services afforded by the city or town fire department. The city or town may determine that certain properties or types or classes of properties are not receiving measurable benefits based on criteria they establish by resolution. A benefit charge authorized by this section shall not be applicable to the personal property or improvements to real property of any individual, corporation, partnership, firm, organization, or association maintaining a fire department and whose fire protection and training system has been accepted by a fire insurance underwriter maintaining a fire protection engineering and inspection service authorized by the state insurance commissioner to do business in this state, but such property may be protected by the city or town under a contractual agreement. For administrative purposes, the benefit charge imposed on any individual property may be compiled into a single charge, provided that the city or town, upon request of the property owner, provide an itemized list of charges for each measurable benefit included in the charge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The resolution establishing benefit charges shall specify, by legal geographical areas or other specific designations, the charge to apply to each property by location, type, or other designation, or other information that is necessary to the proper computation of the benefit charge to be charged to each property owner subject to the resolution. The county assessor of each county shall determine and identify the personal properties and improvements to real property which are subject to a benefit charge in each city or town and shall furnish and deliver to the county treasurer of that county a listing of the properties with information describing the location, legal description, and address of the person to whom the statement of benefit charges is to be mailed, the name of the owner, and the value of the property and improvements, together with the benefit charge to apply to each. These benefit charges shall be certified to the county treasurer for collection in the same manner that is used for the collection of fire protection assessments for forestlands protected by the department of natural resources under RCW 76.04.610 and the same penalties and provisions for collection shall apply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each city and town shall contract, prior to the imposition of a benefit charge, for the administration and collection of the benefit charge by each county treasurer, who shall deduct a percent, as provided by contract to reimburse the county for expenses incurred by the county assessor and county treasurer in the administration of the resolution and this section. The county treasurer shall make distributions each year, as the charges are collected, in the amount of the benefit charges imposed on behalf of the city or town, less the deduction provided for in the contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any benefit charge authorized by this section shall not be effective unless a proposition to impose the benefit charge is approved by a sixty percent majority of the voters of the city or town voting at a general election or at a special election called by the city or town for that purpose, held within the city or town. An election held pursuant to this section shall be held not more than twelve months prior to the date on which the first such charge is to be assessed: PROVIDED, That a benefit charge approved at an election shall not remain in effect for a period of more than six years nor more than the number of years authorized by the voters if fewer than six years unless subsequently reapproved by the voters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ballot shall be submitted so as to enable the voters favoring the authorization of a benefit charge to vote &quot;Yes&quot; and those opposed thereto to vote &quot;No,&quot; and the ballot shall be:</p>

<p>Each person exempt from taxes under RCW 84.36.381 or section 102 of this act in 1993 and thereafter must file with the county assessor a renewal application not later than December 31st of the year the assessor notifies such person of the requirement to file the renewal application. Renewal applications must be on forms prescribed and furnished by the department of revenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least once every six years, the county assessor must notify those persons receiving an exemption from taxes under RCW 84.36.381 or section 102 of this act of the requirement to file a renewal application. The county assessor may also require a renewal application following an amendment of the income requirements set forth in RCW 84.36.381 or section 102 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the assessor finds that the applicant does not meet the qualifications as set forth in RCW 84.36.381 or section 102 of this act, as now or hereafter amended, the claim or exemption must be denied but such denial is subject to appeal under the provisions of RCW 84.48.010 and in accordance with the provisions of RCW 84.40.038. If the applicant had received exemption in prior years based on erroneous information, the taxes must be collected subject to penalties as provided in RCW 84.40.130 for a period of not to exceed five years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department and each local assessor is hereby directed to publicize the qualifications and manner of making claims under RCW 84.36.381 through 84.36.389, through communications media, including such paid advertisements or notices as it deems appropriate. Notice of the qualifications, method of making applications, the penalties for not reporting a change in status, and availability of further information must be included on or with property tax statements and revaluation notices for all residential property including mobile homes, except rental properties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must authorize an option for electronic filing of applications and renewal applications for the exemption under RCW 84.36.381 or section 102 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning August 1, 2023, and by March 1st every third year thereafter, the department must publish updated income thresholds. The adjusted thresholds must be rounded up to the nearest one thousand dollars. If the income threshold adjustment is negative, the income threshold for the prior year continues to apply. The department must adjust income thresholds for each county to reflect the most recent year available of estimated county median household incomes, including preliminary estimates or projections, as published by the office of financial management. For the purposes of this subsection, &quot;county median household income&quot; has the same meaning as provided in RCW 84.36.383.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning with the adjustment made by August 1, 2023, as provided in subsection (8) of this section, and every adjustment thereafter, if an income threshold in a county is not adjusted based on percentage of county median income, then the income threshold must be adjusted based on the growth of the seasonally adjusted consumer price index for all urban consumers (CPI-U) for the prior twelve month period as published by the United States bureau of labor statistics. In no case may the adjustment be greater than one percent. The adjusted thresholds must be rounded to the nearest one dollar. If the income threshold adjustment is negative, the income threshold for the prior year continues to apply.</p>

<li>
<p>Subject to any otherwise applicable statutory dollar rate limitations, regular property taxes may be levied by or for a taxing district in an amount exceeding the limitations provided for in this chapter if such levy is authorized by a proposition approved by a majority of the voters of the taxing district voting on the proposition at a general election held within the district or at a special election within the taxing district called by the district for the purpose of submitting such proposition to the voters. Any election held pursuant to this section shall be held not more than 12 months prior to the date on which the proposed levy is to be made, except as provided in subsection (2) of this section. The ballot of the proposition shall state the dollar rate proposed and shall clearly state the conditions, if any, which are applicable under subsection (4) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to statutory dollar limitations, a proposition placed before the voters under this section may authorize annual increases in levies for multiple consecutive years, up to six consecutive years, during which period each year's authorized maximum legal levy shall be used as the base upon which an increased levy limit for the succeeding year is computed, but the ballot proposition must state the dollar rate proposed only for the first year of the consecutive years and must state the limit factor, or a specified index to be used for determining a limit factor, such as the consumer price index, which need not be the same for all years, by which the regular tax levy for the district may be increased in each of the subsequent consecutive years. Elections for this purpose must be held at a primary or general election. The title of each ballot measure must state the limited purposes for which the proposed annual increases during the specified period of up to six consecutive years shall be used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a levy authorized pursuant to this section is made, the dollar amount of such levy may not be used for the purpose of computing the limitations for subsequent levies provided for in this chapter, unless the ballot proposition expressly states that the levy made under this section will be used for this purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If expressly stated, a proposition placed before the voters under subsection (1) or (2) of this section may:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Use the dollar amount of a levy under subsection (1) of this section, or the dollar amount of the final levy under subsection (2) of this section, for the purpose of computing the limitations for subsequent levies provided for in this chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit the period for which the increased levy is to be made under (a) of this subsection;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit the purpose for which the increased levy is to be made under (a) of this subsection, but if the limited purpose includes making redemption payments on bonds;</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>For the county in which the state capitol is located, the period for which the increased levies are made may not exceed 25 years; and</p>

<p>For districts other than a district under (c)(i) of this subsection, the period for which the increased levies are made may not exceed nine years;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set the levy or levies at a rate less than the maximum rate allowed for the district;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide that the exemption authorized by RCW 84.36.381 or section 102 of this act will apply to the levy of any additional regular property taxes authorized by voters; or</p>

<li>
<p>Include any combination of the conditions in this subsection.</p>
