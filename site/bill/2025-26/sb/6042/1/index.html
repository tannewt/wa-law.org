<ol>
<li>
<p>Following the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the government's primary role in protecting the health, safety, and well-being of its citizens has been underscored. The legislature recognizes that there is a need to focus on the development and implementation of comprehensive safe school plans for each public school. The legislature recognizes that comprehensive safe school plans for each public school are an integral part of rebuilding public confidence. In developing these plans, the legislature finds that a coordinated effort is essential to ensure the most effective response to any type of emergency. Further, the legislature recognizes that comprehensive safe school plans for each public school are of the utmost importance and will help to assure students, parents, guardians, school employees, and school administrators that our schools provide the safest possible learning environment.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that, in 2003, the Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs was directed to develop statewide building mapping software standards and to operate a statewide first responder building mapping information system. The legislature acknowledges that school districts were required to implement their safe school plans consistent with this system, but were not required to update the mapping information unless funding was available. The legislature finds that, since 2003, state appropriations have largely supported only operational costs, leaving school districts responsible for the cost of updating or remapping facilities. As a result, the legislature acknowledges that many school districts lack accurate and comprehensive school mapping information, which is essential for effective emergency response and public safety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2019, the legislature directed the joint legislative audit and review committee to study the statewide school mapping system. The study identified significant limitations, such as inconsistent usage, outdated data, and lack of interoperability across platforms. Despite the existence of the rapid responder system, only 52 school districts accessed the system weekly or daily, while 74 districts logged in once per year or less. At least 33 districts have adopted alternative mapping platforms, creating fragmentation and barriers to coordinated emergency response. Following this study, the legislature acknowledges that it repealed requirements related to school mapping and transferred existing data to the office of the superintendent of public instruction in 2021.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the rise in school shootings and other threats to student safety necessitates a renewed commitment to comprehensive, interoperable, and secure mapping protocols. Emergency responders must have immediate access to accurate, site-specific data that supports rapid decision making and coordinated action. Therefore, the legislature intends to strengthen safe school plans by requiring standardized school mapping formats and features, ensuring compatibility with public safety platforms, and recognizing that sensitive data is protected from public disclosure.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature considers it to be a matter of public safety for public schools and staff to have current safe school plans and procedures in place, fully consistent with federal law. The legislature further finds and intends, by requiring safe school plans to be in place, that school districts will become eligible for federal assistance. The legislature further finds that schools are in a position to serve the community in the event of an emergency resulting from natural disasters or human-induced disasters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Schools and school districts shall consider the guidance and resources provided by the state school safety center, established under RCW 28A.300.630, and the regional school safety centers, established under RCW 28A.310.510, when developing their own individual comprehensive safe school plans. Each school district shall adopt and implement a safe school plan. The plan shall:</p>
<ol type="a">

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Due to geographic location, schools have unique safety challenges. It is the responsibility of school principals and administrators to assess the threats and hazards most likely to impact their school, and to practice three basic functional drills, shelter-in-place, lockdown, and evacuation, as these drills relate to those threats and hazards. Some threats or hazards may require the use of more than one basic functional drill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Schools shall conduct at least one safety-related drill per month, including summer months when school is in session with students. These drills must teach students three basic functional drill responses:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>&quot;Shelter-in-place,&quot; used to limit the exposure of students and staff to hazardous materials, such as chemical, biological, or radiological contaminants, released into the environment by isolating the inside environment from the outside;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Lockdown,&quot; used to isolate students and staff from threats of violence, such as suspicious trespassers or armed intruders, that may occur in a school or in the vicinity of a school. Lockdown drills may not include live simulations of or reenactments of active shooter scenarios that are not trauma-informed and age and developmentally appropriate; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Evacuation,&quot; used to move students and staff away from threats, such as fires, oil train spills, lahars, or tsunamis.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The drills described in (b) of this subsection must incorporate the following requirements:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>A pedestrian evacuation drill for schools in mapped lahars or tsunami hazard zones; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An earthquake drill using the state-approved earthquake safety technique &quot;drop, cover, and hold.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Schools shall document the date, time, and type (shelter-in-place, lockdown, or evacuate) of each drill required under this subsection (5), and maintain the documentation in the school office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This subsection (5) is intended to satisfy all federal requirements for comprehensive school emergency drills and evacuations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Educational service districts are encouraged to apply for federal emergency response and crisis management grants with the assistance of the superintendent of public instruction and the Washington emergency management division of the state military department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction may adopt rules to implement provisions of this section. These rules may include, but are not limited to, provisions for evacuations, lockdowns, or other components of a comprehensive safe school plan.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Whenever a first responder agency notifies a school of a situation that may necessitate an evacuation or lockdown, the agency must determine if other known schools in the vicinity are similarly threatened. The first responder agency must notify every other known school in the vicinity for which an evacuation or lockdown appears reasonably necessary to the agency's incident commander unless the agency is unable to notify schools due to duties directly tied to responding to the incident occurring. For purposes of this subsection, &quot;school&quot; includes a private school under chapter 28A.195 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A first responder agency and its officers, agents, and employees are not liable for any act, or failure to act, under this subsection unless a first responder agency and its officers, agents, and employees acted with willful disregard.</p>
