<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the increased cost of catastrophic wildfires poses an immediate and growing threat to communities, infrastructure, and property in all regions of Washington state. Changing climate conditions and development patterns in the wildland urban interface increases both the likelihood and severity of wildfires capable of consuming entire communities in a single event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that the state must enact policies that both mitigate wildfire risk and prepare Washington to respond effectively when catastrophic wildfires occur. The scale and speed of modern wildfire events require proactive planning, financial readiness, and coordinated oversight to protect lives, property, and essential public systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that a wildfire prevention and protection fund can support both objectives. Such a fund can provide justice for wildfire victims by creating a reliable and timely pathway to compensation when catastrophic losses occur. The legislature finds that victims of catastrophic wildfires are diverse and include tribal governments, local governments, timberland owners, homeowners, renters, and small businesses; many of whom lose not only property but housing, livelihoods, and community stability. All stand to benefit from the existence of a predictable, well-structured fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that the fund should also support wildfire mitigation, prevention, and resilience efforts. Investment revenue generated by the fund may be used to restore forest health, reduce hazardous fuels, and help vulnerable communities harden through measures such as forest health practices and vegetation management, defensible space, and removal of burnable material around homes and critical infrastructure. These investments reduce future wildfire risk and lessen the severity of catastrophic events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature acknowledges that electric utilities are not the sole cause of wildfires, but utility-related ignitions can result in some of the most destructive and costly wildfire events. The magnitude of potential liability from such events threatens utility solvency, destabilizes insurance markets, increases costs for consumers, and jeopardizes the reliability of essential energy infrastructure. The legislature therefore intends that the fund also supports utility financial stability, protects ratepayers from extreme cost shocks, and helps maintain affordable and reliable service for Washington consumers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that Washington cannot rely solely on the federal government to respond to catastrophic wildfires that destroy entire communities. Federal assistance may be delayed or insufficient to address the full scope of losses experienced by victims and local governments. The state must establish its own capacity to respond decisively to catastrophic events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature therefore intends to establish a wildfire prevention and protection fund as part of a comprehensive wildfire resilience strategy that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Provides timely and equitable compensation to victims of catastrophic wildfires;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supports mitigation, prevention, and infrastructure hardening to reduce future wildfire risk;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preserves the financial stability of essential utilities and protects consumers from excessive rate and insurance impacts; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creates a flexible framework capable of evolving as wildfire risk, climate conditions, and best practices change over time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further intends to establish a wildfire protection and prevention council to oversee the fund, guide investment and mitigation priorities, and take other necessary actions to protect the state from wildfire risk. The council shall promote accountability, transparency, and coordination across agencies, utilities, local governments, tribes, and affected communities. By establishing this framework, the legislature takes a measured and forward-looking step to address the reality of catastrophic wildfire risk while advancing justice for victims, strengthening prevention and mitigation efforts, protecting consumers, and safeguarding Washington's long-term economic and environmental health.</p>

<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There is established a fund for the purposes of reimbursing eligible claims paid by electrical companies and consumer-owned utilities for damages that resulted from a covered wildfire. Electrical companies must participate in the fund and pay the fund contribution set by the council under section 3(1)(c) of this act. Consumer-owned utilities may elect to participate in the fund. All electric utilities participating in the fund must comply with the requirements of this section to maintain eligibility for disbursements from the fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To maintain eligibility for the fund, a participating electric utility must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Remit to the administrator of the wildfire fund an annual contribution set by the council. A participating electric utility may collect a surcharge from its customers to cover the cost of the wildfire fund annual contribution in the form of a cost recovery rider, provided that it provides a discounted rate to low-income customers consistent with RCW 80.28.068;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comply with the utility's submitted and approved wildfire mitigation plan. Submission and approval of an electrical company's wildfire mitigation plan shall be consistent with RCW 80.28.445. For consumer-owned utilities, wildfire mitigation plans created consistent with RCW 19.29A.170 must be submitted to the council for approval; and</p>

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) The expected liabilities of the fund over the current and next fiscal biennium; and</p>
<p>(B) The administration of the fund;</p>
<pre><code>    ii. Market share of each participating electric utility; and

    iii. Number of customers and high risk customers of each participating utility;

b. Damages threshold for fund eligibility for each participating electric utility, based on the number of high risk customers the utility serves and the miles of transmission lines the utility owns and operates. The damages threshold shall be the amount of damages from a covered wildfire for which each participating electric utility is responsible before it can seek reimbursement from the fund. Once the damages for a covered wildfire surpass this amount, the participating electric utility can seek reimbursement from the administrator for excess liabilities that surpass the threshold.
