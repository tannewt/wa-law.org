# SB 5382 - Ballot measure petitions

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5382-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature recognizes that the people have reserved for themselves the power to enact or reject legislation through the initiative and referendum process, as provided in Article II, section 1 of the state Constitution. The legislature determines that this right must be further guarded against fraud and mistake.

2. The legislature has previously found that "paying a worker, whose task it is to secure the signatures of voters on initiative or referendum petitions, on the basis of the number of signatures the worker secures on the petitions encourages the introduction of fraud in the signature gathering process. Such a form of payment may act as an incentive for the worker to encourage a person to sign a petition which the person is not qualified to sign or to sign a petition for a ballot measure even if the person has already signed a petition for the measure." RCW 29A.84.280. Despite this finding, paid signature gathering has proliferated in Washington state and is routinely used by ballot measure proponents to qualify initiatives and referenda.

3. Currently, the law requires initiative and referendum petitions to include a statement that the petition signature gatherer swears or affirms under penalty of law that, to the best of the circulator's knowledge, every petitioner signed their true name, correctly provided the accompanying information on the signature sheet, and was not compensated or promised compensation for signing the petition. These circulator declarations regularly go unsigned, leaving no record of the paid worker or other person who circulated the petition and was responsible for gathering the signatures contained therein. To adequately guard the people's initiative and referendum right against fraud and mistake, the legislature determines that the law must be clarified to require each petition signature gatherer circulating an initiative or referendum petition to sign the declaration under penalty of false swearing.

4. The requirement for the petition circulator to sign such a declaration aligns with similar requirements in many other states in fact, a majority of states that have a ballot measure process require similar signed declarations. This requirement promotes the accuracy and integrity of information furnished on petition sheets and enables meaningful enforcement of existing law addressing petition misconduct and other crimes in chapters 9.44 and 29A.84 RCW.

5. The legislature further finds that an election official verifying that the petitioner's residence address on the petition or paper is the same as the residence address on the affidavit of registration will also guard the people's initiative and referendum right against fraud and mistake. Currently, the law requires initiative and referendum petition sheets to include a place for each petitioner to sign and print his or her name, and the address, city, and county at which he or she is registered to vote. However, in 2023, numerous petition signatures on initiatives to the legislature were validated by the secretary of state that were not accompanied by the petitioner's address, city, and county of registration. Without the petitioner's residence address, the secretary of state validated petition signatures by relying on an apparent match between a signature on the petition sheet and a signature associated with a voter registration record, identified through a one-to-many comparison. The requirement for verification of the petitioner's address aligns with similar requirements in several other states, including Idaho and California. Verifying that the petitioner's residence address on an initiative or referendum petition is the same as the residence address on the petitioner's affidavit of voter registration will improve the accuracy of signature matching by reducing the number of potential comparators and confirming that an apparent signature match is correct. This verification will ensure that validated signatures are from registered voters who are qualified to sign petitions. The requirement reduces the risk that signatures from persons who are not qualified to sign will be incorrectly attributed to a qualified registered voter and that duplicate signatures from the same person will be counted more than once.

## Section 2
Each petition signature gatherer circulating an initiative or referendum petition must sign the declaration contained on each sheet of the petition as prescribed in RCW 29A.72.110(1)(b), 29A.72.120(1)(b), or 29A.72.130(1)(b).
