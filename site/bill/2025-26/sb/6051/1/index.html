<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is important that schools are provided flexibility to determine how best to meet the needs of their students and work with their local communities. It is the intent of the legislature to provide schools increased flexibility by authorizing school districts to grant waivers or partial waivers of state laws and rules for schools located within the school district. Additionally, the legislature intends to specifically authorize school districts to use any savings resulting from not having to implement a law or rule that was waived or partially waived.  However, for each waiver granted by the school district that results in a savings, a portion of the savings must be awarded to each school that requested the waiver and to any teacher at a school that brought the idea to the principal to request the waiver.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>

However, each school district must award a portion of the savings to the first school that requested the waiver that resulted in a savings and to the first teacher at a school who brought the idea to the principal to request the waiver.
