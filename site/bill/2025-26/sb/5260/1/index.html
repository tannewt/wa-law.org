<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that juvenile rehabilitation under the department of children, youth, and families is dangerously overcrowded. Overcrowding is contributing to high levels of violence and drug use, and is impeding the ability of youth to be rehabilitated.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that young adults may be better served by transferring their custody to the department of corrections. Such transfers will allow youth to access job programs and education, and place them closer to their families.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that modern brain science demonstrates that as youth age they continue maturing and that as developing adults they should be given the opportunity to make decisions about their own rehabilitation. Furthermore, youth should be given the opportunity to form a vested interest in their own rehabilitation.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
