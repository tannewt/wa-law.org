<p>This chapter may be known and cited as the uniform consumer debt default judgments act.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature enacted critical protections for consumers in 2020 through the passage of Substitute House Bill No. 2476 regarding debt buyers. In enacting the uniform consumer debt default judgments act, the legislature intends to broaden those protections by: (1) Expanding requirements and remedies previously applicable only to debt buyers to be applicable to all holders of purchased debt and any affiliates; and (2) imposing new disclosure requirements in all actions to collect consumer debt and new remedies in actions in which those requirements are not satisfied.</p>

<ol>
<li>Why Am I Getting This Notice?</li>
</ol>
<p>The plaintiff named in the complaint has filed a lawsuit against you to collect money that the plaintiff says you owe.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What Will Happen If I Do Nothing?</li>
</ol>
<p>A judgment may be entered against you if you do not file a response to the lawsuit.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What Happens If A Judgment Is Entered Against Me?</li>
</ol>
<p>Your personal property may be taken and sold. Money may be taken directly from your bank account or wages. A lien may be put on your house or other real estate and the house or real estate may be sold. These are things that could happen, although they won't necessarily happen.</p>
<p>If the judgment is not paid in full, the amount due may grow because of interest charges.</p>
<p>You could owe the amount of any unpaid judgment for up to 20 years, even if it is not credit reported or it no longer appears on your credit report.</p>
<p>The judgment may make it harder for you to get a job or insurance and more expensive for you to get a loan or credit card, rent an apartment, or buy a house or car.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Is Help Available?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you talk with a lawyer, the lawyer can explain the situation and help you decide what to do. If you cannot afford a lawyer, you may be able to obtain one for free or reduced cost. You may call 211 for a referral to legal counsel.</p>
