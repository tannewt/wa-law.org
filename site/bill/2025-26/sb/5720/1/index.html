<ol>
<li>
<p>A default judgment may be entered in an action to which this chapter applies only if the complaint or amended complaint served on the consumer includes, or is accompanied by, a notice warning that a default judgment may be awarded against the consumer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The notice must be substantially similar to the form in subsection (3) of this section that states:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If the consumer does not file an answer to the complaint or amended complaint, a default judgment may be entered against the consumer;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a judgment is entered against the consumer, the amount of the judgment, plus interest on the judgment as provided by other laws of this state, could remain in effect for up to 20 years, even if the judgment is not credit reported or no longer remains on the consumer's credit report;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After entry of a judgment, the plaintiff may, but will not necessarily, take steps to sell real estate owned by the consumer, sell personal property owned by the consumer, attach the consumer's bank accounts, or garnish the consumer's wages;</p>

<li>
<p>Entry of a judgment may in some circumstances impair access to employment, insurance, credit, or housing;</p>

<li>
<p>The following notice meets the requirements of this section:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Consumer Notice</p>
<p>This notice is required to be given to you by law and its content is prescribed by law; this notice and its content are not statements, representations, or threats by, nor advice from, the plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why Am I Getting This Notice?</li>
</ol>
<p>The plaintiff named in the complaint has filed a lawsuit against you to collect money that the plaintiff says you owe.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What Will Happen If I Do Nothing?</li>
</ol>
<p>A judgment may be entered against you.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What Happens If A Judgment Is Entered Against Me?</li>
</ol>
<p>Your personal property may be taken and sold. Money may be taken directly from your bank account or wages. A lien may be put on your house or other real estate and the house or real estate may be sold. These are things that could happen, although they won't necessarily happen.</p>
<p>If the judgment is not paid in full, the amount due may grow because of interest charges.</p>
<p>You could owe the amount of any unpaid judgment for up to 20 years, even if it is not credit reported or it no longer appears on your credit report.</p>
<p>The judgment may make it harder for you to get a job or insurance and more expensive for you to get a loan or credit card, rent an apartment, or buy a house or car.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Is Help Available?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you talk with a lawyer, the lawyer can explain the situation and help you decide what to do. If you cannot afford a lawyer, you may be able to obtain one for free or reduced cost. You may call 211 for a referral to legal counsel.</p>
<h2 id="section-6">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6">¶</a></h2>
<p>If a plaintiff in an action to which this chapter applies fails to comply with any requirement of this chapter, the court may deny the plaintiff's motion for default or default judgment and may on motion of a party or on the court's own motion issue a notice that the court will dismiss the case without prejudice unless, within 30 days following the sending to the plaintiff of such notice of intent to dismiss, the plaintiff files an amended complaint that complies with this chapter.</p>
<h2 id="section-7">Section 7 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7">¶</a></h2>
<p>A waiver by a consumer of a requirement of this chapter is void. This section does not prevent a voluntary settlement agreement or judgment between the parties that does not result in a default judgment.</p>
