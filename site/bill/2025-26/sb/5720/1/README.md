3. The following notice meets the requirements of this section:

Consumer Notice

This notice is required to be given to you by law and its content is prescribed by law; this notice and its content are not statements, representations, or threats by, nor advice from, the plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney.

1. Why Am I Getting This Notice?

The plaintiff named in the complaint has filed a lawsuit against you to collect money that the plaintiff says you owe.

2. What Will Happen If I Do Nothing?

A judgment may be entered against you.

3. What Happens If A Judgment Is Entered Against Me?

Your personal property may be taken and sold. Money may be taken directly from your bank account or wages. A lien may be put on your house or other real estate and the house or real estate may be sold. These are things that could happen, although they won't necessarily happen.

If the judgment is not paid in full, the amount due may grow because of interest charges.

You could owe the amount of any unpaid judgment for up to 20 years, even if it is not credit reported or it no longer appears on your credit report.

The judgment may make it harder for you to get a job or insurance and more expensive for you to get a loan or credit card, rent an apartment, or buy a house or car.

4. Is Help Available?

If you talk with a lawyer, the lawyer can explain the situation and help you decide what to do. If you cannot afford a lawyer, you may be able to obtain one for free or reduced cost. You may call 211 for a referral to legal counsel.

## Section 6
If a plaintiff in an action to which this chapter applies fails to comply with any requirement of this chapter, the court may deny the plaintiff's motion for default or default judgment and may on motion of a party or on the court's own motion issue a notice that the court will dismiss the case without prejudice unless, within 30 days following the sending to the plaintiff of such notice of intent to dismiss, the plaintiff files an amended complaint that complies with this chapter.

## Section 7
A waiver by a consumer of a requirement of this chapter is void. This section does not prevent a voluntary settlement agreement or judgment between the parties that does not result in a default judgment.

## Section 8
This chapter supplements rights and remedies available to a consumer under other laws of this state.

## Section 9
In applying and construing this uniform act, a court shall consider the promotion of uniformity of the law among jurisdictions that enact it.

## Section 10
This chapter modifies, limits, or supersedes the electronic signatures in global and national commerce act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 7001 et seq., but does not modify, limit, or supersede 15 U.S.C. Sec. 7001(c), or authorize electronic delivery of any of the notices described in 15 U.S.C. Sec. 7003(b).

## Section 11
This chapter applies to an action commenced on or after the effective date of this section.

## Section 12
1. No collection agency or out-of-state collection agency may bring or maintain an action in any court of this state involving the collection of its own claim or a claim of any third party without alleging and proving that he, she, or it is duly licensed under this chapter and has satisfied the bonding requirements hereof, if applicable: PROVIDED, That in any case where judgment is to be entered by default, it shall not be necessary for the collection agency or out-of-state collection agency to prove such matters.

2. A copy of the current collection agency license or out-of-state collection agency license shall be prima facie evidence of the licensing and bonding of such collection agency or out-of-state collection agency as required by this chapter.

## Section 13
If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.
