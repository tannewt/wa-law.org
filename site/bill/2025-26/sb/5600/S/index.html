<p>The state expressly intends to displace competition with regulation allowing a transportation network company, at its own volition, to enter into an agreement with the driver resource center regarding a driver account deactivation appeals process for eligible account deactivations. It is the policy of the state to promote a fair appeals process related to eligible account deactivations that supports the rights of drivers and transportation network companies and provides fair processes related to eligible account deactivations. The state intends that any agreement under this section is immune from all federal and state antitrust laws.</p>

<p>(C) Any other categories the transportation network company and the driver resource center may agree to as part of the agreement under this subsection.</p>
<pre><code>    iii. A transportation network company shall enter into an agreement with the driver resource center regarding the driver account deactivation appeals process for eligible account deactivations. Any agreement must be approved by the department. The department may approve an agreement only if the agreement contains the provisions in (a)(iv) of this subsection.

    iv. The agreement must provide an appeals process for drivers whose account has been subject to an eligible account deactivation. The appeals process must include the following protections:
</code></pre>
<p>(A) Opportunity for a driver representative to support a driver, upon the driver's request, throughout the account deactivation appeals process for eligible account deactivations;</p>

<p>(D) A good faith, informal resolution process that is committed to efficient resolution of conflicts regarding eligible account deactivations within 30 days of the transportation network company being notified that the driver contests the explanation offered by the company;</p>
<p>(E) A formal process that includes a just cause standard, with deadlines for adjudication of an appeal of an eligible account deactivation by a panel that includes a mutually agreed-upon neutral third party with experience in dispute resolution. The panel has the authority to make binding decisions within the confines of the law and make-whole monetary awards, including back pay, based on an agreed-upon formula for cases not resolved during the informal process;</p>
<p>(F) Agreement by the transportation network company to use the process set forth in this subsection to resolve disputes over eligible account deactivation appeals as an alternative to private arbitration with regard to such a dispute, should the driver and transportation network company so choose; and</p>
<p>(G) Agreement by the transportation network company that, for eligible account deactivations in which the driver or transportation network company elect private arbitration in lieu of the formal process outlined in (a)(iv)(E) of this subsection (15), the transportation network company shall offer the driver the opportunity to have the eligible deactivation adjudicated under the just cause standard outlined in (a)(iv)(E) of this subsection.</p>
<pre><code>b. A transportation network company that enters into an agreement with the driver resource center shall reach agreement through the following steps:

<pre><code>    ii. If the driver resource center and transportation network company cannot reach an agreement, then they are required to submit issues of dispute before a jointly agreed-upon mediator.

    iii. After mediation lasting no more than two months has been exhausted and no resolution has been reached, then the parties will proceed to binding arbitration before a panel of arbitrators consisting of one arbitrator selected by the driver resource center, one arbitrator selected by the transportation network company, and a third arbitrator selected by the other two. If the two selected arbitrators cannot agree to the third arbitrator within 10 days, then the third arbitrator shall be determined from a list of seven arbitrators with experience in labor disputes or interest arbitration designated by the American arbitration association. A coin toss shall determine which side strikes the first name. Thereafter the other side shall strike a name. The process will continue until only one name remains, who shall be the third arbitrator. Alternatively, the driver resource center and the transportation network company may agree to a single arbitrator.

    iv. The arbitrators must submit their decision, based on majority rule, within 60 days of the panel or arbitrator being chosen.

v. The decision of the majority of arbitrators is final and binding and will then be submitted to the director of the department for final approval.

c. In reviewing any agreement between a transportation network company and the driver resource center, under (a) of this subsection, the department shall review the agreement to ensure that its content is consistent with this subsection and the public policy goals set forth in this subsection. The department shall consider in its review both qualitative and quantitative effects of the agreement and how the agreement comports with the state policies set forth in this section. In conducting a review, the record shall not be limited to the submissions of the parties nor to the terms of the proposed agreement and the department shall have the right to conduct public hearings and request additional information from the parties, provided that such information: (i) Is relevant for determining whether the agreement complies with this subsection; and (ii) does not contain either parties' confidential, proprietary, or privileged information, or any individual's personal identifying information from the parties.
