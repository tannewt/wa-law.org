[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5123.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that:

1. Clear and comprehensive definitions that reflect an evolving understanding of identity can ensure that Washington schools are at the forefront of inclusivity;

2. While federal protections provide a foundation, the legislature recognizes the urgency of addressing the needs of diverse communities. Through state protections, the legislature ensures equity and justice for every student regardless of federal action or inaction;

3. Discrimination can create an environment of harassment and exclusion, creating barriers to learning and development and leading to severe impacts on student mental health and academic success. This often results in higher rates of anxiety and depression for marginalized students;

4. Inclusive schools have been shown to improve mental health outcomes through a sense of belonging. For example, LGBTQ-affirming schools play a role in reducing suicidal ideation for LGBTQ students according to the Trevor project; and

5. By providing statewide protections for marginalized students, Washington can pave the way for more inclusivity.
