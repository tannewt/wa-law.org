<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the state, through the state's general fund, invests in K-12 education, health care, higher education, other essential governmental services, and the working families' tax credit, all of which help Washingtonians succeed and thrive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These general fund dollars help the state meet its paramount duty to make ample provision for the education of all children in the state, including children who qualify for special education services, creating the opportunity for each child to succeed in school and achieve success in life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The general fund supports health care programs that deliver critical, life-saving medical care, provide support for those with developmental and other disabilities, offers long-term care for the elderly, and protects the long-term health and well-being of the public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further, the general fund invests in higher education, including two and four-year colleges, apprenticeships, and other postsecondary education and training programs, ensuring Washington students remain competitive in the workforce and broader economy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The general fund also invests in human services that provide vital basic-needs assistance to the state's lowest-income households and educate the youngest learners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the intent of this act is to maintain and preserve essential governmental services for Washingtonians, particularly within K-12 education, health care, higher education, and human services, and support working families by ensuring continued investment in the working families' tax credit by depositing revenues from this act into the general fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further recognizes that reforming our tax code to be common sense, balanced, and sustainable is essential to the long-term economic success of Washington. The Washington tax structure, developed during the Great Depression, relies heavily on excise and consumption taxes, with consequences for equity, adequacy, and long-term fiscal stability that persist today. The legislature recognizes that more progress is needed for the state to have a fair and balanced tax system that can provide sustainable, ample funding for K-12 education, health care, higher education, human services, and other essential governmental services. Washington's tax system remains the second most regressive in the nation as it asks those with the least to pay the most as a percentage of their income. Low-income Washingtonians pay at least three times more in state and local taxes as a percentage of their income than the state's highest income households.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further, due to the action of the federal government through the passage of HR 1, Washington's highest-income households are set to receive an average federal tax break of $90,850 while Washington's lowest-income households are set to receive a mere $200. These tax breaks were largely funded through cuts to federal funding in health care and food security programs, negatively impacting Washington's working families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus, the legislature intends to limit the tax established by this act to only individuals with annual adjusted gross income of $1,000,000 or more. Washingtonians with an annual adjusted gross income of less than $1,000,000 will not owe this tax. As a result, the millionaires' tax is estimated to affect only the wealthiest one-half of one percent of the households in this state, taking a significant step toward reducing the disproportionate reliance on working people to fund K-12 education, health care, higher education, human services, the working families' tax credit, and other essential governmental services to benefit Washingtonians.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further intends to exempt certain sources of income from the tax including, but not limited to, the sale of qualified family owned small businesses and the sale of all residential and other real property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also the intent of the legislature to rebalance the tax system by reducing taxes on consumers and businesses through small business and other business and occupation tax credits, as well as by exempting from the retail sales tax essential household items such as personal care products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus, to help meet the state's paramount duty of amply providing every child in the state with an education and supporting the health and well-being of Washingtonians, it is the intent of the legislature, by adopting this act, insofar as possible, to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Impose a tax on those individuals with the greatest ability to pay, specifically those earning Washington adjusted gross income during the taxable year of at least $1,000,000;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the Washington millionaires' tax law identical in effect to the provisions of the internal revenue code relating to the measurement of adjusted gross income of individuals, modified as necessary to achieve the goals and purpose of this act;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Achieve this result by the application of the various provisions of the internal revenue code relating to the definition of income, exemptions and exclusions therefrom, accounting methods, basis, depreciation, and other pertinent provisions, subject to additional exemptions and modifications as provided in this act, resulting in a final amount called &quot;Washington adjusted taxable income&quot;; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impose a tax on residents of this state measured by Washington adjusted taxable income wherever derived and to impose a tax on nonresidents measured by Washington adjusted taxable income from sources within this state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that, in 2024, Washington counties were responsible for more than 90 percent of the costs associated with public defense in the state, creating a system of legal representation that varies greatly depending on where a person lives in Washington state. While fully funding public defense is not the responsibility of the state, the state is responsible under the United States Constitution for ensuring the protection of the right to counsel for all defendants. Furthermore, the Washington state supreme court's decision to modify caseload standards in 2025 will significantly increase the overall cost of providing public defense in Washington state. Through the creation and funding of the local government public defense stabilization account, the legislature intends to provide funding to help counties meet their obligations.</p>

For the purposes of this subsection (7), a federal income tax return is changed in a manner that is final when such change is not subject to either administrative review by the United States internal revenue service or judicial review in a court of competent jurisdiction, or both.

No penalty so added may be less than $5.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the department of revenue determines that any tax has been substantially underpaid, there is assessed a penalty of five percent of the amount of the tax determined by the department to be due. If payment of any tax determined by the department to be due is not received by the department by the due date specified in the notice, or any extension thereof, there is assessed a total penalty of 15 percent of the amount of the tax under this subsection; and if payment of any tax determined by the department to be due is not received on or before the 30th day following the due date specified in the notice of tax due, or any extension thereof, there is assessed a total penalty of 25 percent of the amount of the tax under this subsection. No penalty so added may be less than $5. As used in this subsection, &quot;substantially underpaid&quot; means that the taxpayer has paid less than 80 percent of the amount of tax determined by the department to be due for all of the types of taxes included in, and for the entire period of time covered by, the department's examination, and the amount of underpayment is at least $1,000.</p>

<p>If the department finds that a person has engaged in any business or performed any act upon which a tax is imposed under this title and that person has not obtained from the department a registration certificate as required by RCW 82.32.030, the department must impose a penalty of five percent of the amount of tax due from that person for the period that the person was not registered as required by RCW 82.32.030. The department may not impose the penalty under this subsection (4) if a person who has engaged in business taxable under this title without first having registered as required by RCW 82.32.030, prior to any notification by the department of the need to register, obtains a registration certificate from the department.</p>

<li>
<p>If the department finds that a taxpayer has disregarded specific written instructions as to reporting or tax liabilities, or willfully disregarded the requirement to file returns or remit payment electronically, as provided by RCW 82.32.080, the department must add a penalty of 10 percent of the amount of the tax that should have been reported and/or paid electronically or the additional tax found due if there is a deficiency because of the failure to follow the instructions. A taxpayer disregards specific written instructions when the department has informed the taxpayer in writing of the taxpayer's tax obligations and the taxpayer fails to act in accordance with those instructions unless, in the case of a deficiency, the department has not issued final instructions because the matter is under appeal pursuant to this chapter or departmental regulations. The department may not assess the penalty under this section upon any taxpayer who has made a good faith effort to comply with the specific written instructions provided by the department to that taxpayer. A taxpayer will be considered to have made a good faith effort to comply with specific written instructions to file returns and/or remit taxes electronically only if the taxpayer can show good cause, as defined in RCW 82.32.080, for the failure to comply with such instructions. A taxpayer will be considered to have willfully disregarded the requirement to file returns or remit payment electronically if the department has mailed or otherwise delivered the specific written instructions to the taxpayer on at least two occasions. Specific written instructions may be given as a part of a tax assessment, audit, determination, closing agreement, or other written communication, provided that such specific written instructions apply only to the taxpayer addressed or referenced on such communication. Any specific written instructions by the department must be clearly identified as such and must inform the taxpayer that failure to follow the instructions may subject the taxpayer to the penalties imposed by this subsection. If the department determines that it is necessary to provide specific written instructions to a taxpayer that does not comply with the requirement to file returns or remit payment electronically as provided in RCW 82.32.080, the specific written instructions must provide the taxpayer with a minimum of 45 days to come into compliance with its electronic filing and/or payment obligations before the department may impose the penalty authorized in this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the department finds that all or any part of a deficiency resulted from engaging in a disregarded transaction, as described in RCW 82.32.655(3), the department must assess a penalty of 35 percent of the additional tax found to be due as a result of engaging in a transaction disregarded by the department under RCW 82.32.655(2). The penalty provided in this subsection may be assessed together with any other applicable penalties provided in this section on the same tax found to be due, except for the evasion penalty provided in subsection (7) of this section. The department may not assess the penalty under this subsection if, before the department discovers the taxpayer's use of a transaction described under RCW 82.32.655(3), the taxpayer discloses its participation in the transaction to the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the department finds that all or any part of the deficiency resulted from an intent to evade the tax payable hereunder, a further penalty of 50 percent of the additional tax found to be due must be added.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The penalties imposed under subsections (1) through (4) of this section can each be imposed on the same tax found to be due. This subsection does not prohibit or restrict the application of other penalties authorized by law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may not impose the evasion penalty in combination with the penalty for disregarding specific written instructions or the penalty provided in subsection (6) of this section on the same tax found to be due.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a taxpayer substantially underpays an estimated payment of tax imposed under RCW 82.87.040 pursuant to RCW 82.87.110(3), there is assessed a penalty of five percent of the amount of the actual tax due for tax imposed under RCW 82.87.040. As used in this subsection, &quot;substantially underpaid&quot; means that an individual's estimated payment for taxes imposed under RCW 82.87.040 was less than 80 percent of the actual tax due, and at least $1,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the total estimated tax payments under section 501 of this act for the tax year are substantially underpaid, there is assessed a penalty of five percent of the amount of the underpaid tax. If a pass-through entity makes an election under section 502 of this act, this subsection (11) applies to the estimated tax payments of the pass-through entity in lieu of the individual. As used in this subsection, &quot;substantially underpaid&quot; means that an individual's total annual estimated tax payments under section 501 of this act were less than 80 percent of the actual annual tax due, and at least $5,000.</p>

Sec. 522(b)(2), the exemptions in this section relating to retirement benefits are provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise provided by federal law, any money received by any citizen of the state of Washington as a pension from the government of the United States, whether the same be in the actual possession of such person or be deposited or loaned, shall be exempt from execution, attachment, garnishment, or seizure by or under any legal process whatever, and when a debtor dies, or absconds, and leaves his or her family any money exempted by this subsection, the same shall be exempt to the family as provided in this subsection. This subsection shall not apply to child support collection actions issued under chapter 26.18, 26.23, or 74.20A RCW, if otherwise permitted by federal law, or to collection actions for taxes imposed under Title 82A RCW (the new title created in section 1003 of this act).</p>

<p>The right of a person to a pension, annuity, or retirement allowance or disability allowance, or death benefits, or any optional benefit, or any other right accrued or accruing to any citizen of the state of Washington under any employee benefit plan, and any fund created by such a plan or arrangement, shall be exempt from execution, attachment, garnishment, or seizure by or under any legal process whatever. This subsection shall not apply to child support collection actions issued under chapter 26.18, 26.23, or 74.20A RCW if otherwise permitted by federal law, or to collection actions for taxes imposed under Title 82A RCW (the new title created in section 1003 of this act). This subsection shall permit benefits under any such plan or arrangement to be payable to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant in such plan to the extent expressly provided for in a qualified domestic relations order that meets the requirements for such orders under the plan, or, in the case of benefits payable under a plan described in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 403(b) or 408 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, or section 409 of such code as in effect before January 1, 1984, to the extent provided in any order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction that provides for maintenance or support. This subsection does not prohibit actions against an employee benefit plan, or fund for valid obligations incurred by the plan or fund for the benefit of the plan or fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, the term &quot;employee benefit plan&quot; means any plan or arrangement that is described in RCW 49.64.020, including any Keogh plan, whether funded by a trust or by an annuity contract, and in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 401(a) or 403(a) of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended; or that is a tax-sheltered annuity or a custodial account described in section 403(b) of such code or an individual retirement account or an individual retirement annuity described in section 408 of such code; or a Roth individual retirement account described in section 408A of such code; or a medical savings account or a health savings account described in sections 220 and 223, respectively, of such code; or a retirement bond described in section 409 of such code as in effect before January 1, 1984. The term &quot;employee benefit plan&quot; shall not include any employee benefit plan that is established or maintained for its employees by the government of the United States, by the state of Washington under chapter 2.10, 2.12, 41.26, 41.32, 41.34, 41.35, 41.37, 41.40, or 43.43 RCW or RCW 41.50.770, or by any agency or instrumentality of the government of the United States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An employee benefit plan shall be deemed to be a spendthrift trust, regardless of the source of funds, the relationship between the trustee or custodian of the plan and the beneficiary, or the ability of the debtor to withdraw or borrow or otherwise become entitled to benefits from the plan before retirement. This subsection shall not apply to child support collection actions issued under chapter 26.18, 26.23, or 74.20A RCW, if otherwise permitted by federal law, or to collection actions for taxes imposed under Title 82A RCW (the new title created in section 1003 of this act). This subsection shall permit benefits under any such plan or arrangement to be payable to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant in such plan to the extent expressly provided for in a qualified domestic relations order that meets the requirements for such orders under the plan, or, in the case of benefits payable under a plan described in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 403(b) or 408 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, or section 409 of such code as in effect before January 1, 1984, to the extent provided in any order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction that provides for maintenance or support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless prohibited by federal law, nothing contained in subsection (3), (4), or (5) of this section shall be construed as a termination or limitation of a spouse's community property interest in an employee benefit plan held in the name of or on account of the other spouse, who is the participant or the account holder spouse. Unless prohibited by applicable federal law, at the death of the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse, the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse may transfer or distribute the community property interest of the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse in the participant or account holder spouse's employee benefit plan to the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse's estate, testamentary trust, inter vivos trust, or other successor or successors pursuant to the last will of the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse or the law of intestate succession, and that distributee may, but shall not be required to, obtain an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, including a nonjudicial binding agreement or order entered under chapter 11.96A RCW, to confirm the distribution. For purposes of subsection (3) of this section, the distributee of the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse's community property interest in an employee benefit plan shall be considered a person entitled to the full protection of subsection (3) of this section. The nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse's consent to a beneficiary designation by the participant or account holder spouse with respect to an employee benefit plan shall not, absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, be deemed a release, gift, relinquishment, termination, limitation, or transfer of the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse's community property interest in an employee benefit plan. For purposes of this subsection, the term &quot;nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse&quot; means the spouse of the person who is a participant in an employee benefit plan or in whose name an individual retirement account is maintained. As used in this subsection, an order of a court of competent jurisdiction entered under chapter 11.96A RCW includes an agreement, as that term is used under RCW 11.96A.220.</p>
