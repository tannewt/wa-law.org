# SB 6346 - Tax on millionaires

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6346-S.E.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that the state, through the state's general fund, invests in K-12 education, health care, higher education, other essential governmental services, and the working families' tax credit, all of which help Washingtonians succeed and thrive.

2. These general fund dollars help the state meet its paramount duty to make ample provision for the education of all children in the state, including children who qualify for special education services, creating the opportunity for each child to succeed in school and achieve success in life.

3. The general fund supports health care programs that deliver critical, life-saving medical care, provide support for those with developmental and other disabilities, offers long-term care for the elderly, and protects the long-term health and well-being of the public.

4. Further, the general fund invests in higher education, including two and four-year colleges, apprenticeships, and other postsecondary education and training programs, ensuring Washington students remain competitive in the workforce and broader economy.

5. The general fund also invests in human services that provide vital basic-needs assistance to the state's lowest-income households and educate the youngest learners.

6. Therefore, the intent of this act is to maintain and preserve essential governmental services for Washingtonians, particularly within K-12 education, health care, higher education, and human services, and support working families by ensuring continued investment in the working families' tax credit by depositing revenues from this act into the general fund.

7. The legislature further recognizes that reforming our tax code to be common sense, balanced, and sustainable is essential to the long-term economic success of Washington. The Washington tax structure, developed during the Great Depression, relies heavily on excise and consumption taxes, with consequences for equity, adequacy, and long-term fiscal stability that persist today. The legislature recognizes that more progress is needed for the state to have a fair and balanced tax system that can provide sustainable, ample funding for K-12 education, health care, higher education, human services, and other essential governmental services. Washington's tax system remains the second most regressive in the nation as it asks those with the least to pay the most as a percentage of their income. Low-income Washingtonians pay at least three times more in state and local taxes as a percentage of their income than the state's highest income households.

8. Further, due to the action of the federal government through the passage of HR 1, Washington's highest-income households are set to receive an average federal tax break of $90,850 while Washington's lowest-income households are set to receive a mere $200. These tax breaks were largely funded through cuts to federal funding in health care and food security programs, negatively impacting Washington's working families.

9. Thus, the legislature intends to limit the tax established by this act to only individuals with annual adjusted gross income of $1,000,000 or more. Washingtonians with an annual adjusted gross income of less than $1,000,000 will not owe this tax. As a result, the millionaires' tax is estimated to affect only the wealthiest one-half of one percent of the households in this state, taking a significant step toward reducing the disproportionate reliance on working people to fund K-12 education, health care, higher education, human services, the working families' tax credit, and other essential governmental services to benefit Washingtonians.

10. The legislature further intends to exempt certain sources of income from the tax including, but not limited to, the sale of qualified family owned small businesses and the sale of all residential and other real property.

11. It is also the intent of the legislature to rebalance the tax system by reducing taxes on consumers and businesses through small business and other business and occupation tax credits, as well as by exempting from the retail sales tax essential household items such as personal care products.

12. Thus, to help meet the state's paramount duty of amply providing every child in the state with an education and supporting the health and well-being of Washingtonians, it is the intent of the legislature, by adopting this act, insofar as possible, to:

    a. Impose a tax on those individuals with the greatest ability to pay, specifically those earning Washington adjusted gross income during the taxable year of at least $1,000,000;

    b. Make the Washington millionaires' tax law identical in effect to the provisions of the internal revenue code relating to the measurement of adjusted gross income of individuals, modified as necessary to achieve the goals and purpose of this act;

    c. Achieve this result by the application of the various provisions of the internal revenue code relating to the definition of income, exemptions and exclusions therefrom, accounting methods, basis, depreciation, and other pertinent provisions, subject to additional exemptions and modifications as provided in this act, resulting in a final amount called "Washington adjusted taxable income"; and

    d. Impose a tax on residents of this state measured by Washington adjusted taxable income wherever derived and to impose a tax on nonresidents measured by Washington adjusted taxable income from sources within this state.

13. The legislature finds that, in 2024, Washington counties were responsible for more than 90 percent of the costs associated with public defense in the state, creating a system of legal representation that varies greatly depending on where a person lives in Washington state. While fully funding public defense is not the responsibility of the state, the state is responsible under the United States Constitution for ensuring the protection of the right to counsel for all defendants. Furthermore, the Washington state supreme court's decision to modify caseload standards in 2025 will significantly increase the overall cost of providing public defense in Washington state. Through the creation and funding of the local government public defense stabilization account, the legislature intends to provide funding to help counties meet their obligations.

The numerator of the fraction is the amount of the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income subject to tax in the other jurisdiction. The denominator of the fraction is the taxpayer's total Washington base income. The fraction may never be greater than one.

2. If the laws of the other taxing jurisdiction contain a provision exempting a resident of this state from liability for the payment of income taxes on income earned for personal services performed in such jurisdiction, then the department may enter into a reciprocal agreement with such jurisdiction providing a similar tax exemption on income earned for personal services performed in this state.

3. The credit claimed under this section for a taxable year may not exceed the tax otherwise due under this chapter for that taxable year. Unused credit may not be carried forward or backward to another taxable year. No refunds may be granted for unused credit under this section.

2. The credit under this section is earned in regard to income reportable for federal income tax purposes and may be claimed against taxes due under this chapter, for the taxable year in which the income is reportable for federal income tax purposes. The credit claimed for a taxable year may not exceed the tax otherwise due under this chapter for that taxable year. Unused credit may not be carried forward or backward to another tax reporting period. No refunds may be granted for unused credit under this section.

## Section 205

This subsection (3) applies only to taxpayers owing tax under chapter 82.87 RCW for that taxable year. "Washington capital gains" has the same meaning as provided in RCW 82.87.020.

## Section 303
In computing a taxpayer's Washington base income, the taxpayer must add to the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income any income that has been excluded under section 103 of the internal revenue code in computing federal adjusted gross income, except interest on obligations of the state of Washington or political subdivisions of the state of Washington.

## Section 304
In computing a taxpayer's Washington base income, the taxpayer must add to the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income:

## Section 306
In computing a taxpayer's Washington base income, the taxpayer must deduct, to the extent included, from the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income, any income derived from obligations of the United States that this state is prohibited by federal law from subjecting to a net income tax. However, the amount deducted under this section must be reduced by any expense, including amortizable bond premiums, incurred in the production of such income to the extent the expense has been deducted in calculating federal adjusted gross income.

## Section 307
In computing a resident taxpayer's Washington base income, the taxpayer must add to the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income, all income from a trust treated as a nongrantor trust for federal income tax purposes but funded with an incomplete gift for purposes of section 2511 of the internal revenue code and its accompanying regulations, to the extent the trust income is not otherwise included in the calculation of Washington base income.

## Section 308
In determining a taxpayer's Washington taxable income, the taxpayer may deduct from their Washington base income the amount of charitable contributions they claimed for the taxable year under section 170 of the internal revenue code, up to a maximum deduction of $100,000 per individual, or in the case of spouses or domestic partners, their combined charitable deduction is limited to $100,000, regardless of whether they file joint or separate returns.

## Section 309
In computing a taxpayer's Washington taxable income, the taxpayer must add to the taxpayer's Washington base income the taxpayer's distributive share of the tax expense incurred by a pass-through entity under section 502 of this act to the extent the expense has been deducted in calculating the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income.

## Section 310

The amount of the standard deduction must be annually adjusted pursuant to section 313 of this act. The standard deduction must be adjusted for nonresidents as provided in section 312 of this act.

## Section 312
The deduction from Washington base income allowed under section 311 of this act for individual taxpayers who are not residents of this state for the entire taxable year must be reduced by multiplying the amount of the deduction by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the individual's Washington base income. The denominator of the fraction is the individual's federal adjusted gross income from all sources. The fraction may never be greater than one.

## Section 313
1. Beginning October 2029 and each October thereafter, the department must adjust the standard deduction under section 311 of this act by multiplying the current standard deduction amount by one plus the percentage by which the most current consumer price index available on October 1st of the current year exceeds the consumer price index for the prior 12-month period, and rounding the result to the nearest $1,000. If an adjustment under this subsection (1) would reduce the standard deduction amount, the department must not adjust the amounts for use in the following year. The department must publish the adjusted standard deduction amount on its public website by October 31st of each year. The adjusted standard deduction amount calculated under this subsection (1) takes effect for taxes due in the following calendar year.

    c. Income of a nonresident student athlete derived from the commercial use of the student athlete's name, image, or likeness as provided in section 407 of this act;

    d.

4. Compensation paid by the United States for service in the armed forces of the United States performed in this state by a nonresident does not constitute income derived from sources within this state.

## Section 402
1. Income derived from sources within this state include an apportioned share of the individual's distributive share of income, gains, losses, and deductions from pass-through entities that operate in the state, as provided in subsection (2) of this section.

2. The allowable modifications and credits under this chapter for partners, members, or shareholders of a pass-through entity are computed by including a pro rata share of the Washington base income and the credits allowed under sections 203 through 205 of this act, if the modification or credit relates to the income of the pass-through entity. Each member's, partner's, or shareholder's pro rata share of a modification or credit is the amount of modification or credit based on the pro rata share of net income or loss on a member's, partner's, or shareholder's federal schedule K-1 form.

3. For purposes of this section, "pro rata share" means pro rata share as reflected on the member's, partner's, or shareholder's federal schedule K-1 form.

## Section 403

## Section 404
1. For nonresident members of a professional athletic team, the portion of compensation attributable to athletic performances in the state must be apportioned to Washington as provided under this section.

2. [Empty]

    a. The portion of the compensation of a member of a professional athletic team apportioned to Washington is that portion of compensation received for the tax year that bears the same ratio to total compensation received for the tax year as the number of duty days within this state bears to the total number of duty days spent both within and outside this state during the tax year.

    b. Notwithstanding the description of the portion of compensation subject to apportionment to the state of Washington under this subsection, the department may provide by rule alternative methodologies for determining the portion of compensation subject to apportionment to the state of Washington that the department determines to be fair and equitable.

3. [Empty]

    a. A person who transacts business in the state of Washington and who pays wages, salary, bonuses, or other taxable income to a member of a professional athletic team, must submit a report to the department each year indicating any member of a professional athletic team who may be reasonably assumed to owe tax under this chapter for the calendar year.

## Section 405
1. The portion of federal adjusted gross income of a nonresident derived from or connected with a business, trade, or profession carried on in this state, including a sole proprietorship and any distributive share of a pass-through entity of a business, trade, or profession carried on in this state, must be apportioned and allocated as provided in this section. This section does not apply to compensation received as an employee allocated under section 403 of this act.

2. Income from a business, trade, or profession carried on in this state, including any distributive share of a pass-through entity of a business, trade, or profession carried on in this state, must be classified as either apportionable income or nonapportionable income.

3. All apportionable income must be apportioned to this state by multiplying the income by the receipts factor. The receipts factor is a fraction the numerator of which is the total receipts of the taxpayer in this state during the tax period and the denominator of which is the total receipts of the taxpayer everywhere during the tax period.

    a. Receipts from the sale of tangible personal property are in this state if:

        i. The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than the United States government, within this state regardless of the free on board point or other conditions of the sale; or

        ii. The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory, or other place of storage in this state and (A) the purchaser is the United States government or (B) the taxpayer is not taxable in the state of the purchaser.

    b. [Empty]

        i. Receipts, other than receipts described in (a) of this subsection (3), are in this state if the taxpayer's market for the sales is in this state. The taxpayer's market for sales is in this state:

(A) In the case of sale, rental, lease, or license of real property, if and to the extent the property is located in this state;

(B) In the case of rental, lease, or license of tangible personal property, if and to the extent the property is located in this state;

(C) In the case of sale of a service, if and to the extent the service is delivered to a location in this state; and

(D) In the case of intangible property:

(I) That is rented, leased, or licensed, if and to the extent the property is used in this state, provided that intangible property used in marketing a good or service to a consumer is "used in this state" if that good or service is purchased by a consumer who is in this state; and

(II) That is sold, if and to the extent the property is used in this state, if:

1. A contract right, government license, or similar intangible property that authorizes the holder to conduct a business activity in a specific geographic area is "used in this state" if the geographic area includes all or part of this state;

2. Receipts from intangible property sales that are contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of the intangible property must be treated as receipts from the rental, lease, or licensing of such intangible property under subsection (4)(a)(i) of this section; and

3. All other receipts from a sale of intangible property must be excluded from the numerator and denominator of the receipts factor.

    c. If the state or states of assignment under (b) of this subsection (3) cannot be determined, the state or states of assignment must be reasonably approximated.

    d. If the taxpayer is not taxable in a state to which a receipt is assigned under this subsection (3), or if the state of assignment cannot be determined under (b) of this subsection (3) or reasonably approximated under (c) of this subsection (3), the receipt must be excluded from the denominator of the receipts factor.

4. [Empty]

    a. If the allocation and apportionment provisions in subsection (3) of this section do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer's business activity in this state, the taxpayer may petition for or the department may require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer's business activity, if reasonable:

        i. Separate accounting;

        ii. The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;

        iii. The inclusion of one or more additional factors that will fairly represent the taxpayer's business activity in this state; or

        iv. The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer's income.

    b. If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly represent the extent of business activity in this state for taxpayers engaged in a particular industry or in a particular transaction or activity, the department may, in addition to the authority provided in (a) of this subsection (4), adopt rules for determining alternative allocation and apportionment methods for such taxpayers. Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection (4)(b) must be applied uniformly, except that with respect to any taxpayer to whom such rule applies, the taxpayer may petition for, or the department may require, adjustment under (a) of this subsection (4).

    c. [Empty]

        i. The party petitioning for, or the department requiring, the use of any method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer's income pursuant to (a) of this subsection (4) must prove by clear and convincing evidence:

(A) That the allocation and apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer's business activity in this state; and

(B) That the alternative to such provisions is reasonable.

        ii. The same burden of proof applies whether the taxpayer is petitioning for, or the department is requiring, the use of any reasonable method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer's income. However, if the department can show that in any two of the prior five tax years, the taxpayer had used an allocation or apportionment method at variance with its allocation or apportionment method or methods used for such other tax years, then the department does not bear the burden of proof in imposing a different method pursuant to (a) of this subsection (4).

        iii. If the department requires any method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer's income, the department may not impose any civil or criminal penalty with reference to the tax due that is attributable to the taxpayer's reasonable reliance solely on the allocation and apportionment provisions of this section.

        iv. A taxpayer that has received written permission from the department to use a reasonable method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer's income may not have that permission revoked with respect to transactions and activities that have already occurred unless there has been a material change in, or a material misrepresentation of, the facts provided by the taxpayer upon which the department reasonably relied.

In the event a taxpayer's federal income tax return is changed in a manner that is final after their return required under subsection (1) of this section is filed with the department and the taxpayer's federal income tax return is changed in a manner that impacts either the calculation of their Washington adjusted gross income or their tax liability under this chapter, or both, the taxpayer must amend the taxpayer's return due under subsection (1) of this section for the same tax year in which their federal income tax return is changed. For the purposes of this subsection (7), a federal income tax return is changed in a manner that is final when such change is not subject to either administrative review by the United States internal revenue service or judicial review in a court of competent jurisdiction, or both. A change is also final in the case of an audit finding in the following circumstances:

        ii. As provided in RCW 82.32.050(4).

    b. In the event the statute of limitations is extended under (a)(i) of this subsection, no assessment or correction of an assessment for additional taxes, penalties, or interest due may be made by the department more than four years after the year in which an amended return is filed with the department as required under subsection (7) of this section. Any assessment or correction of an assessment for additional taxes, penalties, or interest due under this subsection (8)(b) but made by the department more than four years after the year in which a return is filed under subsection (1) of this section must be directly related to the federal income tax return change described in subsection (7) of this section.

3. The liability for tax due under this chapter of each spouse or state registered domestic partner is joint and several, unless:

    a. The spouse or state registered domestic partner is relieved of liability for federal tax purposes as provided under sections 66 or 6015 of the internal revenue code; or

4. [Empty]

    a. Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, individuals who are spouses or state registered domestic partners are not considered separate taxpayers for the purposes of this chapter regardless of whether they file a joint or separate return for the tax imposed under this chapter. The activities and assets of each spouse or state registered domestic partner are combined as if they were one individual for the purposes of determining the applicability of any threshold amounts, caps, deductions, credits, or any other amounts related to the activities or assets of an individual throughout this chapter.

    b. When an individual does not file a joint return for the tax imposed under this chapter, both spouses or state registered domestic partners must allocate between themselves their respective share of the marital community's or domestic partnership's income, gains, losses, deductions, and credits in a manner consistent with the community property laws of this state and the applicable provisions of the internal revenue code, and its accompanying regulations, addressing taxpayers domiciled in community property jurisdictions.

For tax liabilities arising before January 1, 1992, interest shall be computed at the rate of nine percent per annum from the last day of the year in which the deficiency is incurred until the earlier of December 31, 1998, or the date of payment. After December 31, 1998, the rate of interest shall be variable and computed as provided in subsection (2) of this section. The rate so computed shall be adjusted on the first day of January of each year for use in computing interest for that calendar year.

    b. For tax liabilities arising after December 31, 1991, the rate of interest shall be variable and computed as provided in subsection (2) of this section from the last day of the year in which the deficiency is incurred until the date of payment. The rate so computed shall be adjusted on the first day of January of each year for use in computing interest for that calendar year.

    c. [Empty]

        i.

        ii. For interest associated with annual tax reporting periods having a due date as prescribed in RCW 82.32.045(3) , 82.87.110, and section 702 of this act, interest must be computed from the last day of April immediately following each such annual reporting period included in the notice, until the due date of the notice.

        iii. For purposes of computing interest under (c)(i) and (ii) of this subsection (1):

(A) The same computation of interest applies regardless of whether the department grants additional time for filing any return under RCW 82.32.080(4)(a)(i).

(B) If the department extends a due date under subsection (3) of this section or RCW 82.32.080(4)(b), and payment is not made in full by the extended due date, interest is computed from the last day of the month in which the extended due date occurs until the date of payment.

        iv. If payment in full is not made by the due date of the notice, additional interest shall be computed under this subsection (1)(c) until the date of payment. The rate of interest shall be variable and computed as provided in subsection (2) of this section. The rate so computed shall be adjusted on the first day of January of each year for use in computing interest for that calendar year.

2. For the purposes of this section, the rate of interest to be charged to the taxpayer shall be an average of the federal short-term rate as defined in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 1274(d) plus two percentage points. The rate set for each new year shall be computed by taking an arithmetical average to the nearest percentage point of the federal short-term rate, compounded annually. That average shall be calculated using the rates from four months: January, April, and July of the calendar year immediately preceding the new year, and October of the previous preceding year.

3. During a state of emergency declared under RCW 43.06.010(12), the department, on its own motion or at the request of any taxpayer affected by the emergency, may extend the due date of any assessment or correction of an assessment for additional taxes, penalties, or interest as the department deems proper.

4. No assessment or correction of an assessment for additional taxes, penalties, or interest due may be made by the department more than four years after the close of the tax year, except (a) against a taxpayer who has not registered as required by this chapter, (b) upon a showing of fraud or of misrepresentation of a material fact by the taxpayer, or (c) where a taxpayer has executed a written waiver of such limitation. The execution of a written waiver shall also extend the period for making a refund or credit as provided in RCW 82.32.060(2).

## Section 706
1.

Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, no refund or credit may be made for taxes, penalties, or interest paid more than four years prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the refund application is made or examination of records is completed.

2. [Empty]

    a. The execution of a written waiver under RCW 82.32.050 or 82.32.100 will extend the time for making a refund or credit of any taxes paid during, or attributable to, the years covered by the waiver if, prior to the expiration of the waiver period, an application for refund of such taxes is made by the taxpayer or the department discovers a refund or credit is due.

    b. A refund or credit must be allowed for an excess payment resulting from the failure to claim a bad debt deduction, credit, or refund under RCW 82.04.4284, 82.08.037, 82.12.037, 82.14B.150, or 82.16.050(5) for debts that became bad debts under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 166, as amended or renumbered as of January 1, 2003, less than four years prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the refund application is made or examination of records is completed.

3. Any such refunds must be made by means of vouchers approved by the department and by the issuance of state warrants drawn upon and payable from such funds as the legislature may provide. However, taxpayers who are required to pay taxes by electronic funds transfer under RCW 82.32.080 must have any refunds paid by electronic funds transfer if the department has the necessary account information to facilitate a refund by electronic funds transfer.

4. Any judgment for which a recovery is granted by any court of competent jurisdiction, not appealed from, for tax, penalties, and interest which were paid by the taxpayer, and costs, in a suit by any taxpayer must be paid in the same manner, as provided in subsection (3) of this section, upon the filing with the department of a certified copy of the order or judgment of the court.

    a. Interest at the rate of three percent per annum must be allowed by the department and by any court on the amount of any refund, credit, or other recovery allowed to a taxpayer for taxes, penalties, or interest paid by the taxpayer before January 1, 1992. This rate of interest applies for all interest allowed through December 31, 1998. Interest allowed after December 31, 1998, must be computed at the rate as computed under RCW 82.32.050(2). The rate so computed must be adjusted on the first day of January of each year for use in computing interest for that calendar year.

    b. For refunds or credits of amounts paid or other recovery allowed to a taxpayer after December 31, 1991, the rate of interest must be the rate as computed for assessments under RCW 82.32.050(2) less one percent. This rate of interest applies for all interest allowed through December 31, 1998. Interest allowed after December 31, 1998, must be computed at the rate as computed under RCW 82.32.050(2). The rate so computed must be adjusted on the first day of January of each year for use in computing interest for that calendar year.

5. Interest allowed on a credit notice or refund issued after December 31, 2003, must be computed as follows:

    a. If all overpayments for each calendar year and all reporting periods ending with the final month included in a notice or refund were made on or before the due date of the final return for each calendar year or the final reporting period included in the notice or refund:

        i. Interest must be computed from January 31st following each calendar year included in a notice or refund;

        ii. Interest must be computed from the last day of the month following the final month included in a notice or refund; or

        iii. For interest associated with annual tax reporting periods having a due date as prescribed in RCW 82.32.045(3) , 82.87.110, and section 702 of this act, interest must be computed from the last day of April following each such annual reporting period included in a notice or refund.

    b. If the taxpayer has not made all overpayments for each calendar year and all reporting periods ending with the final month included in a notice or refund on or before the dates specified by RCW 82.32.045 for the final return for each calendar year or the final month included in the notice or refund, interest must be computed from the last day of the month following the date on which payment in full of the liabilities was made for each calendar year included in a notice or refund, and the last day of the month following the date on which payment in full of the liabilities was made if the final month included in a notice or refund is not the end of a calendar year.

    c. Interest included in a credit notice must accrue up to the date the taxpayer could reasonably be expected to use the credit notice, as defined by the department's rules. If a credit notice is converted to a refund, interest must be recomputed to the date the refund is issued, but not to exceed the amount of interest that would have been allowed with the credit notice.

## Section 707
1. If payment of any tax due on a return to be filed by a taxpayer is not received by the department of revenue by the due date, there is assessed a penalty of nine percent of the amount of the tax; and if the tax is not received on or before the last day of the month following the due date, there is assessed a total penalty of 19 percent of the amount of the tax under this subsection; and if the tax is not received on or before the last day of the second month following the due date, there is assessed a total penalty of 29 percent of the amount of the tax under this subsection. No penalty so added may be less than $5.

2. If the department of revenue determines that any tax has been substantially underpaid, there is assessed a penalty of five percent of the amount of the tax determined by the department to be due. If payment of any tax determined by the department to be due is not received by the department by the due date specified in the notice, or any extension thereof, there is assessed a total penalty of 15 percent of the amount of the tax under this subsection; and if payment of any tax determined by the department to be due is not received on or before the 30th day following the due date specified in the notice of tax due, or any extension thereof, there is assessed a total penalty of 25 percent of the amount of the tax under this subsection. No penalty so added may be less than $5. As used in this subsection, "substantially underpaid" means that the taxpayer has paid less than 80 percent of the amount of tax determined by the department to be due for all of the types of taxes included in, and for the entire period of time covered by, the department's examination, and the amount of underpayment is at least $1,000.

3. If a warrant is issued by the department of revenue for the collection of taxes, increases, and penalties, there is added thereto a penalty of 10 percent of the amount of the tax, but not less than $10.

4. If the department finds that a person has engaged in any business or performed any act upon which a tax is imposed under this title and that person has not obtained from the department a registration certificate as required by RCW 82.32.030, the department must impose a penalty of five percent of the amount of tax due from that person for the period that the person was not registered as required by RCW 82.32.030. The department may not impose the penalty under this subsection (4) if a person who has engaged in business taxable under this title without first having registered as required by RCW 82.32.030, prior to any notification by the department of the need to register, obtains a registration certificate from the department.

5. If the department finds that a taxpayer has disregarded specific written instructions as to reporting or tax liabilities, or willfully disregarded the requirement to file returns or remit payment electronically, as provided by RCW 82.32.080, the department must add a penalty of 10 percent of the amount of the tax that should have been reported and/or paid electronically or the additional tax found due if there is a deficiency because of the failure to follow the instructions. A taxpayer disregards specific written instructions when the department has informed the taxpayer in writing of the taxpayer's tax obligations and the taxpayer fails to act in accordance with those instructions unless, in the case of a deficiency, the department has not issued final instructions because the matter is under appeal pursuant to this chapter or departmental regulations. The department may not assess the penalty under this section upon any taxpayer who has made a good faith effort to comply with the specific written instructions provided by the department to that taxpayer. A taxpayer will be considered to have made a good faith effort to comply with specific written instructions to file returns and/or remit taxes electronically only if the taxpayer can show good cause, as defined in RCW 82.32.080, for the failure to comply with such instructions. A taxpayer will be considered to have willfully disregarded the requirement to file returns or remit payment electronically if the department has mailed or otherwise delivered the specific written instructions to the taxpayer on at least two occasions. Specific written instructions may be given as a part of a tax assessment, audit, determination, closing agreement, or other written communication, provided that such specific written instructions apply only to the taxpayer addressed or referenced on such communication. Any specific written instructions by the department must be clearly identified as such and must inform the taxpayer that failure to follow the instructions may subject the taxpayer to the penalties imposed by this subsection. If the department determines that it is necessary to provide specific written instructions to a taxpayer that does not comply with the requirement to file returns or remit payment electronically as provided in RCW 82.32.080, the specific written instructions must provide the taxpayer with a minimum of 45 days to come into compliance with its electronic filing and/or payment obligations before the department may impose the penalty authorized in this subsection.

6. If the department finds that all or any part of a deficiency resulted from engaging in a disregarded transaction, as described in RCW 82.32.655(3), the department must assess a penalty of 35 percent of the additional tax found to be due as a result of engaging in a transaction disregarded by the department under RCW 82.32.655(2). The penalty provided in this subsection may be assessed together with any other applicable penalties provided in this section on the same tax found to be due, except for the evasion penalty provided in subsection (7) of this section. The department may not assess the penalty under this subsection if, before the department discovers the taxpayer's use of a transaction described under RCW 82.32.655(3), the taxpayer discloses its participation in the transaction to the department.

7. If the department finds that all or any part of the deficiency resulted from an intent to evade the tax payable hereunder, a further penalty of 50 percent of the additional tax found to be due must be added.

8. The penalties imposed under subsections (1) through (4) of this section can each be imposed on the same tax found to be due. This subsection does not prohibit or restrict the application of other penalties authorized by law.

9. The department may not impose the evasion penalty in combination with the penalty for disregarding specific written instructions or the penalty provided in subsection (6) of this section on the same tax found to be due.

10. If a taxpayer substantially underpays an estimated payment of tax imposed under RCW 82.87.040 pursuant to RCW 82.87.110(3), there is assessed a penalty of five percent of the amount of the actual tax due for tax imposed under RCW 82.87.040. As used in this subsection, "substantially underpaid" means that an individual's estimated payment for taxes imposed under RCW 82.87.040 was less than 80 percent of the actual tax due, and at least $1,000.

11. If the total estimated tax payments under section 501 of this act for the tax year are substantially underpaid, there is assessed a penalty of five percent of the amount of the underpaid tax. If a pass-through entity makes an election under section 502 of this act, this subsection (11) applies to the estimated tax payments of the pass-through entity in lieu of the individual. As used in this subsection, "substantially underpaid" means that an individual's total annual estimated tax payments under section 501 of this act are less than the tax shown on the return required under section 702(1) of this act unless the estimated tax remitted to the department is either: (a) 90 percent of the tax shown on the return required under section 702(1) of this act; or (b) 100 percent of the tax shown on the most recently filed tax return under section 702(1) of this act.

12. For the purposes of this section, "return" means any document a person is required by the state of Washington to file to satisfy or establish a tax or fee obligation that is administered or collected by the department, and that has a statutorily defined due date. "Return" also includes the submission of any estimated payment of tax as provided in RCW 82.87.110(3) and the confirmation of an extension of the filing due date required under RCW 82.87.110(5).

## Section 708
The department may reasonably estimate the items of business or nonbusiness income of a taxpayer having an office within the state and one or more other states or foreign countries which may be apportioned or allocated to the state and may enter into estimation agreements with such taxpayers for the determination of their liability for the tax imposed by this chapter.

## Section 709
1. To the extent possible without being inconsistent with this chapter, all of the provisions of subtitle F (procedure and administration) of the internal revenue code relating to the following subjects apply to the taxes imposed under this chapter:

    c. Time and manner of making returns, extensions of time for filing returns, verification of returns, and the time when a return is deemed to be filed by the department.

2. The department by rule may provide modifications and exceptions to the provisions listed in subsection (1) of this section, if reasonably necessary to facilitate the prompt, efficient, and equitable collection of tax under this chapter.

## Section 710
The department may adopt rules under chapter 34.05 RCW for the administration and enforcement of this chapter. The rules, to the extent possible without being inconsistent with this chapter, must follow the internal revenue code and the regulations and rulings of the United States treasury department with respect to the federal income tax. The department may adopt as a part of these rules any portions of the internal revenue code and United States treasury department regulations and rulings, in whole or in part.

## Section 711

3. The office of financial management shall calculate each county's personal income ratio by December 31, 2028, and December 31st of each year thereafter, using the most recent annual county personal income data published by the federal bureau of economic analysis for the state of Washington and notify the state treasurer. The updated county personal income ratio applies to county distributions in the following calendar year.

4. For the purpose of this section, "county's personal income ratio" means the personal income of the county divided by the personal income of the state of Washington, as determined under subsection (3) of this section.

Sec. 522(b)(2), the exemptions in this section relating to retirement benefits are provided.

2. Unless otherwise provided by federal law, any money received by any citizen of the state of Washington as a pension from the government of the United States, whether the same be in the actual possession of such person or be deposited or loaned, shall be exempt from execution, attachment, garnishment, or seizure by or under any legal process whatever, and when a debtor dies, or absconds, and leaves his or her family any money exempted by this subsection, the same shall be exempt to the family as provided in this subsection. This subsection shall not apply to child support collection actions issued under chapter 26.18, 26.23, or 74.20A RCW, if otherwise permitted by federal law, or to collection actions for taxes imposed under Title 82A RCW (the new title created in section 1103 of this act).

The right of a person to a pension, annuity, or retirement allowance or disability allowance, or death benefits, or any optional benefit, or any other right accrued or accruing to any citizen of the state of Washington under any employee benefit plan, and any fund created by such a plan or arrangement, shall be exempt from execution, attachment, garnishment, or seizure by or under any legal process whatever. This subsection shall not apply to child support collection actions issued under chapter 26.18, 26.23, or 74.20A RCW if otherwise permitted by federal law, or to collection actions for taxes imposed under Title 82A RCW (the new title created in section 1103 of this act). This subsection shall permit benefits under any such plan or arrangement to be payable to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant in such plan to the extent expressly provided for in a qualified domestic relations order that meets the requirements for such orders under the plan, or, in the case of benefits payable under a plan described in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 403(b) or 408 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, or section 409 of such code as in effect before January 1, 1984, to the extent provided in any order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction that provides for maintenance or support. This subsection does not prohibit actions against an employee benefit plan, or fund for valid obligations incurred by the plan or fund for the benefit of the plan or fund.

4. For the purposes of this section, the term "employee benefit plan" means any plan or arrangement that is described in RCW 49.64.020, including any Keogh plan, whether funded by a trust or by an annuity contract, and in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 401(a) or 403(a) of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended; or that is a tax-sheltered annuity or a custodial account described in section 403(b) of such code or an individual retirement account or an individual retirement annuity described in section 408 of such code; or a Roth individual retirement account described in section 408A of such code; or a medical savings account or a health savings account described in sections 220 and 223, respectively, of such code; or a retirement bond described in section 409 of such code as in effect before January 1, 1984.

5. An employee benefit plan shall be deemed to be a spendthrift trust, regardless of the source of funds, the relationship between the trustee or custodian of the plan and the beneficiary, or the ability of the debtor to withdraw or borrow or otherwise become entitled to benefits from the plan before retirement. This subsection shall not apply to child support collection actions issued under chapter 26.18, 26.23, or 74.20A RCW, if otherwise permitted by federal law, or to collection actions for taxes imposed under Title 82A RCW (the new title created in section 1103 of this act). This subsection shall permit benefits under any such plan or arrangement to be payable to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant in such plan to the extent expressly provided for in a qualified domestic relations order that meets the requirements for such orders under the plan, or, in the case of benefits payable under a plan described in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 403(b) or 408 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, or section 409 of such code as in effect before January 1, 1984, to the extent provided in any order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction that provides for maintenance or support.

6. Unless prohibited by federal law, nothing contained in subsection (3), (4), or (5) of this section shall be construed as a termination or limitation of a spouse's community property interest in an employee benefit plan held in the name of or on account of the other spouse, who is the participant or the account holder spouse. Unless prohibited by applicable federal law, at the death of the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse, the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse may transfer or distribute the community property interest of the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse in the participant or account holder spouse's employee benefit plan to the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse's estate, testamentary trust, inter vivos trust, or other successor or successors pursuant to the last will of the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse or the law of intestate succession, and that distributee may, but shall not be required to, obtain an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, including a nonjudicial binding agreement or order entered under chapter 11.96A RCW, to confirm the distribution. For purposes of subsection (3) of this section, the distributee of the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse's community property interest in an employee benefit plan shall be considered a person entitled to the full protection of subsection (3) of this section. The nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse's consent to a beneficiary designation by the participant or account holder spouse with respect to an employee benefit plan shall not, absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, be deemed a release, gift, relinquishment, termination, limitation, or transfer of the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse's community property interest in an employee benefit plan. For purposes of this subsection, the term "nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse" means the spouse of the person who is a participant in an employee benefit plan or in whose name an individual retirement account is maintained. As used in this subsection, an order of a court of competent jurisdiction entered under chapter 11.96A RCW includes an agreement, as that term is used under RCW 11.96A.220.

## Section 805
1. The right of any person to any future payment under the provisions of this chapter shall not be transferable or assignable at law or in equity, and none of the moneys paid or payable or the rights existing under this chapter, shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process, or to the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law. This section shall not be applicable to any child support collection action taken under chapter 26.18, 26.23, or 74.20A RCW. Benefits under this chapter shall be payable to a spouse or ex-spouse to the extent expressly provided for in any court decree of dissolution or legal separation or in any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to any court decree of dissolution or legal separation.

2. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to deprive any participant, eligible to receive a pension hereunder, from receiving a pension under any other act to which that participant may become eligible by reason of services other than or in addition to his or her services under this chapter.

3. Subsection (1) of this section does not exempt any pension or other benefit received under this chapter from tax under Title 82A RCW (the new title created in section 1103 of this act).

    b. Under a group health care benefit plan approved pursuant to RCW 28A.400.350 or 41.05.065 from authorizing monthly deductions therefrom, of the amount or amounts of subscription payments, premiums, or contributions to any person, firm, or corporation furnishing or providing medical, surgical, and hospital care or other health care insurance; or
