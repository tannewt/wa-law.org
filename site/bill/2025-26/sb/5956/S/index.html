<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that an increasing number of public schools throughout the United States are beginning to use artificial intelligence, automated decision systems, and surveillance technologies in ways that can affect student discipline and school safety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that such tools can amplify existing disparities in student discipline and may result in disproportionate monitoring and punishment of Black students, indigenous students, students of color, students with disabilities, LGBTQ students, and other students protected under chapters 49.60, 28A.640, and 28A.642 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that Washington state has enacted student privacy protections, including in chapter 28A.604 RCW and RCW 28A.605.030, and that the office of the superintendent of public instruction has issued guidance on human-centered artificial intelligence in education. However, existing laws and guidance do not expressly address the use of artificial intelligence in automated decision systems in student discipline and surveillance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature in this initial act to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Prohibit the most harmful uses of artificial intelligence in automated decision systems and surveillance technologies in K–12 public schools, including predictive &quot;risk scores&quot; for individual students and real-time biometric tracking of students;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that automated decision systems do not replace the judgment of trained school personnel in discipline-related decisions; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Direct the office of the superintendent of public instruction to update their guidance and the Washington state school directors' association to develop a model policy and procedures for school districts, charter schools, and state-tribal education compact schools consistent with these protections.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<ol type="a">
