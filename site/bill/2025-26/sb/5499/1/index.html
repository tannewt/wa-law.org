<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that in 2022, the governor signed into law 2nd Substitute Senate Bill No. 5695, the drug free prisons act to reduce entry of contraband into institutions and to increase personal dignity for incarcerated individuals. The legislature finds that since March 2018, the department of corrections has been using body scanners to detect contraband, which has resulted in the confiscation of nearly 1,000 unique items, over 43 grams of controlled substances, and over $100 in currency. The legislature recognizes that without passage of legislation, funding and authorization for the body scanner program will discontinue. Therefore, the legislature resolves to continue existing practice of the body scanner program by codifying operational standards and requiring continued utilization of scanners in certain institutions of total confinement.</p>
