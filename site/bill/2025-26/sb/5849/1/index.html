<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that acquiring and applying a basic knowledge of personal finance is critical to the economic well-being of all adults. Without this knowledge, persons are much less well equipped to navigate the complicated financial issues of modern life, including household budgets, consumer debt, loan applications and obligations, and successful retirement planning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also recognizes that it has taken meaningful steps to support financial education instruction in public schools, including establishing the financial education public-private partnership in 2004, adopting financial education learning standards in 2015, and providing funds in 2022 for financial education professional development for certificated staff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also recognizes the state board of education has undertaken FutureReady, an initiative to streamline the graduation requirements framework to promote accessibility and equity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In recognition of the relevance and importance of personal finance knowledge, the ongoing efforts of the financial education public-private partnership, the ability of public schools to teach or continue teaching financial education instruction, and in alignment with the FutureReady initiative, the legislature intends to ensure that all Washington students are provided financial education instruction. Therefore, the legislature intends to make financial education instruction a graduation requirement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
