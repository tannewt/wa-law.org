<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>The legislative body of a city, town, or county shall adopt regulations and procedures, and appoint administrative personnel for the summary approval of short plats and short subdivisions or alteration or vacation thereof. When an alteration or vacation involves a public dedication, the alteration or vacation shall be processed as provided in RCW 58.17.212 or 58.17.215.

<p>All cities, code cities, and townslocated in a county planning under RCW 36.70A.040 shall by June 30, 2026, adopt or enact procedures for unit lot subdivisions . Portions of the parent lot not subdivided for individual unit lots shall be owned in common by the owners of the individual unit lots, or by a homeowners' association comprised of the owners of the individual unit lots.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>These procedures shall include, at a minimum, the requirement that prominent informational notes be placed on the unit lot subdivision's plat, and recorded in the county or counties in which such land is located, to acknowledge each of the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>Approval of the design and layout of the unit lot's housing development project was granted based on detailed review of that specified project, as a whole, on the parent lot, including specific reference to the applicable permit or file number for that specified project;</li>
</ol>
<p>ii. Subsequent subdivision actions, additions, or modifications to the unit lot housing development project's structures may not create or increase any nonconformity of the parent lot as a whole, and shall conform to the approved unit lot housing development project or to the land use and development standards in effect at the time of the proposed actions, additions, or modifications;</p>
<p>iii. If a structure or portion of a structure within the unit lot housing development project has been damaged or destroyed, any repair, reconstruction, or replacement of any structure shall conform to the approved unit lot housing development project or to the land use and development standards in effect at the time the proposed repair, reconstruction, or replacement project's permit application becomes vested; and</p>
<p>iv. Additional development or redevelopment of the individual unit lots may be limited as a result of the application of development standards to the parent lot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These procedures shall also:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Not require any public predecision meeting or hearing, nor any design review other than administrative design review;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply only clear and objective development regulations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be logically integrated with the application, review, and approval procedures that apply to the underlying unit lot housing development project to the greatest extent feasible; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be specifically subject to the maximum time period for local government actions as set forth in RCW 36.70B.080, unless extended pursuant to project-specific mutual agreement as permitted by RCW 36.70B.080.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>After June 30, 2026, no city, code city, or town subject to this section may decline to accept, process, or approve an application for a unit lot subdivision, consistent with the procedural requirements of (a) and (b) of this subsection, solely because that city, code city, or town has not completed adoption or enactment of the procedures required under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Prohibits a city or county from applying public health, safety, building code, and environmental permitting requirements to a development project that is subject to or integrated with a unit lot subdivision process;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires a city or county to authorize a development project or a unit lot subdivision in a location where development is restricted under other laws, rules, or ordinances, such as in locations where development is limited as a result of physical proximity to on-site sewage system infrastructure, critical areas, or other unsuitable physical characteristics of a property.</p>
