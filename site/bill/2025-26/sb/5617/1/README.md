## Section 3
1. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the juvenile court shall not accept the filing of a child in need of services petition by the child or the parents or the filing of an at-risk youth petition by the parent, unless verification is provided that the department, or a community-based entity under contract with the department, has completed a family assessment. The family assessment shall involve the multidisciplinary team if one exists. The family assessment or plan of services developed by the multidisciplinary team shall be aimed at family reconciliation, reunification, and avoidance of the out-of-home placement of the child. A family assessment is not required for a child in need of services petition filed pursuant to section 9 of this act.

2. Except as provided otherwise in this section, a child or a child's parent may file with the juvenile court a child in need of services petition to approve an out-of-home placement for the child before completion of a family assessment. The department shall, when requested, assist either a parent or child in the filing of the petition. The petition must be filed in the county where the parent resides, except for petitions filed pursuant to section 9 of this act. The petition shall allege that the child is a child in need of services and shall ask only that the placement of a child outside the home of his or her parent be approved, except for petitions filed pursuant to section 9 of this act. The filing of a petition to approve the placement is not dependent upon the court's having obtained any prior jurisdiction over the child or his or her parent, and confers upon the court a special jurisdiction to approve or disapprove an out-of-home placement under this chapter.

3. A petition may not be filed if the child is the subject of a proceeding under chapter 13.34 RCW.

## Section 4
1. Whenever a child in need of services petition is filed by: (a) A youth pursuant to RCW 13.32A.150 or section 9 of this act; (b) the child or the child's parent pursuant to RCW 13.32A.120; or (c) the department pursuant to RCW 13.32A.140, the filing party shall have a copy of the petition served on the parents of the youth. Service shall first be attempted in person and if unsuccessful, then by certified mail with return receipt, except as provided otherwise.

2. Whenever a child in need of services petition is filed by a youth or parent pursuant to RCW 13.32A.150 or section 9 of this act, the court shall immediately notify the department that a petition has been filed.

3. When a child in need of services petition is filed by the department, and the court or the petitioning party knows or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved, the provisions of chapter 13.38 RCW apply.

4. When a court schedules an emergency hearing under section 9 of this act, the court shall make diligent efforts to inform the parent or legal guardian of the emergency hearing. The notice may be given by any means reasonably certain of notifying the parent or legal guardian including, but not limited to: Written, including in an electronic format; telephone; or in-person oral notification.

## Section 5

2. Upon filing of a child in need of services petition, except for a petition filed pursuant to section 9 of this act, the child may be placed, if not already placed, by the department in a crisis residential center, HOPE center, foster family home, group home facility licensed under chapter 74.15 RCW, or any other suitable residence to be determined by the department. The court may place a child in a crisis residential center for a temporary out-of-home placement as long as the requirements of RCW 13.32A.125 are met.

3. If the child has been placed in a foster family home or group care facility under chapter 74.15 RCW, the child shall remain there, or in any other suitable residence as determined by the department, pending resolution of the petition by the court. Any placement may be reviewed by the court within three judicial days upon the request of the juvenile or the juvenile's parent.

## Section 6
1. The court shall hold a fact-finding hearing to consider a proper child in need of services petition, giving due weight to the intent of the legislature that families have the right to place reasonable restrictions and rules upon their children, appropriate to the individual child's developmental level. The court may appoint legal counsel and/or a guardian ad litem to represent the child and advise parents of their right to be represented by legal counsel. At the commencement of the hearing, the court shall advise the parents of their rights as set forth in RCW 13.32A.160(1). If the court approves or denies a child in need of services petition, a written statement of the reasons must be filed.

2. The court may approve an order stating that the child shall be placed in a residence other than the home of his or her parent only if it is established by a preponderance of the evidence, including a departmental recommendation for approval or dismissal of the petition, that:

    a. The child is a child in need of services as defined in RCW 13.32A.030(5);

    b. If the petitioner is a child, he or she has made a reasonable effort to resolve the conflict. This subsection does not apply to a petition filed pursuant to section 9 of this act;

    c. Reasonable efforts have been made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from the child's home and to make it possible for the child to return home; and

    d. A suitable out-of-home placement resource is available. This subsection does not apply to a petition filed pursuant to section 9 of this act.

The court may not grant a petition filed by the child or the department if it is established that the petition is based only upon a dislike of reasonable rules or reasonable discipline established by the parent.

The court may not grant the petition if the child is the subject of a proceeding under chapter 13.34 RCW.

3. Following the fact-finding hearing the court shall: (a) Approve a child in need of services petition and, if appropriate, enter a temporary out-of-home placement for a period not to exceed 14 days pending approval of a disposition decision to be made under RCW 13.32A.179(2); (b) approve an at-risk youth petition filed by the parents and dismiss the child in need of services petition, unless the petition was filed pursuant to section 9 of this act; or (c) dismiss the petition.

2. At the conclusion of the disposition hearing, the court may: (a) Reunite the family and dismiss the petition; (b) approve an at-risk youth petition filed by the parents and dismiss the child in need of services petition, unless the child in need of services petition was filed pursuant to section 9 of this act; (c) approve an out-of-home placement requested in the child in need of services petition by the parents unless the child in need of services petition was filed pursuant to section 9 of this act; or (d) order an out-of-home placement at the request of the child or the department not to exceed 90 days.

At any time the court may order the department to review the matter for purposes of filing a dependency petition under chapter 13.34 RCW. Whether or not the court approves or orders an out-of-home placement, the court may also order any conditions of supervision as set forth in RCW 13.32A.196(3).

3. The court may only enter an order under subsection (2)(d) of this section if it finds by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that: (a)(i) The order is in the best interest of the family; (ii) the parents have not requested an out-of-home placement; (iii) the parents have not exercised any other right listed in RCW 13.32A.160(1)(e); (iv) the child has made reasonable efforts to resolve the problems that led to the filing of the petition; (v) the problems cannot be resolved by delivery of services to the family during continued placement of the child in the parental home; (vi) reasonable efforts have been made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from the child's home and to make it possible for the child to return home; and (vii) a suitable out-of-home placement resource is available; (b)(i) the order is in the best interest of the child; and (ii) the parents are unavailable; or (c) the parent's actions cause an imminent threat to the child's health or safety.
