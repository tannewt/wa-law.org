# SB 5945 - Modifying the definition of persistent offender to exclude convictions for offenses committed by someone under the age of 18 and providing for resentencing.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5945.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature recognizes that in Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. 460 (2012), the United States supreme court affirmed that sentencing youth to mandatory life without parole for certain offenses committed under the age of 18 constitutes cruel and unusual punishment when the sentencing court does not consider youth or its attendant characteristics as a mitigating factor. The Washington state supreme court subsequently confirmed that such mandatory life without parole sentencing schemes are unconstitutional for youth, regardless of whether a court considers youth and its attendant characteristics as mitigating factors in State v. Bassett, 192 Wn.2d 67, 428 P.3d 343 (2018). These landmark decisions reflect the advancement of brain development science and a growing national and state understanding that children are fundamentally different from adults in their capacity for judgment, impulse control, and potential for rehabilitation.

The legislature finds that it established section 9, chapter 130, Laws of 2014 to comply with Miller but only applying to prospective cases, creating an injustice for a small number of individuals whose qualifying crime as a youth was committed before the implementation date of the bill.

The legislature finds that, despite the Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. 460 (2012) and State v. Bassett, 192 Wn.2d 67, 428 P.3d 343 (2018) rulings and section 9, chapter 130, Laws of 2014, a very small number of individuals in Washington remain incarcerated for offenses committed as juveniles, having received "strike" sentences following prosecution in adult court. This outcome is inconsistent with the spirit and intent of both Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. 460 (2012) and State v. Bassett, 192 Wn.2d 67, 428 P.3d 343 (2018).

The legislature further finds that this disparity undermines fairness and equal treatment under the law and fails to reflect contemporary scientific understandings of adolescent brain development and the increased capacity youth have for growth and rehabilitation.

Therefore, the legislature intends to update the persistent offender statute to ensure that youth are treated in a manner consistent with the spirit and intent of Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. 460 (2012) and State v. Bassett, 192 Wn.2d 67, 428 P.3d 343 (2018), contemporary science, and fundamental principles of fairness and equal treatment under the law. This update is intended to clarify constitutional protections for youth, promote equitable sentencing practices, and reflect society's understanding that children, even when held accountable, possess a unique capacity for rehabilitation.

2. "Collect," or any derivative thereof, "collect and remit," or "collect and deliver," when used with reference to the department, means that the department, either directly or through a collection agreement authorized by RCW 9.94A.760, is responsible for monitoring and enforcing the offender's sentence with regard to the legal financial obligation, receiving payment thereof from the offender, and, consistent with current law, delivering daily the entire payment to the superior court clerk without depositing it in a departmental account.

However, when a defendant is charged with a recidivist offense, "criminal history" includes a vacated prior conviction for the sole purpose of establishing that such vacated prior conviction constitutes an element of the present recidivist offense as provided in RCW 9.94A.640(4)(b) and 9.96.060(8)(c).

19. "Disposable earnings" means that part of the earnings of an offender remaining after the deduction from those earnings of any amount required by law to be withheld. For the purposes of this definition, "earnings" means compensation paid or payable for personal services, whether denominated as wages, salary, commission, bonuses, or otherwise, and, notwithstanding any other provision of law making the payments exempt from garnishment, attachment, or other process to satisfy a court-ordered legal financial obligation, specifically includes periodic payments pursuant to pension or retirement programs, or insurance policies of any type, but does not include payments made under Title 50 RCW, except as provided in RCW 50.40.020 and 50.40.050, or Title 74 RCW.
