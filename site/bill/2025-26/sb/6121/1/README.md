# SB 6121 - Large energy use facilities

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6121.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that the rapid growth of large energy-consuming customers, including data centers, may necessitate substantial investment in new electrical generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure. The intent of this act is to ensure that the costs and risks of these energy-related investments are borne solely by the customers causing the need for the investment, thereby protecting residential, small commercial, and existing industrial ratepayers from unwarranted rate increases.

    b. Any contract for the provision of electricity service entered into between an electric utility and a retail electricity consumer that is a large energy use facility must:

        i. Be consistent with the model tariff developed in accordance with section 3 of this act;

        ii. Specify the duration of the contract and be for a duration of 10 years or longer;

    c. Any contract for the provision of electricity service entered into between an electric utility and a retail electricity consumer that is a large energy use facility, may include a charge for excess demand for the electricity services the electric utility is contracted to provide that is in addition to the tariff schedule.

2. A consumer-owned utility that has executed a contract with a large energy use facility on or before the effective date of this section is considered to be in compliance with the requirements of subsection (1) of this section as long as the contract meets the criteria under subsection (1) of this section.

## Section 5
Section 4 of this act applies to retail electricity consumers that are large energy use facilities that:

1. Enter into a contract for electricity service with an electric utility after December 31, 2027; or

2. Enter into a contract for electricity service with an electric utility before January 1, 2028, if the provision of electricity service requires the electric utility to make significant investments or incur costs after January 1, 2028, that could result in increased costs or risks to other retail electricity consumers of the electric utility.

## Section 6
1. By September 1st of each odd-numbered year, the department must submit a report, and may include recommendations for legislation, to the relevant committees of the legislature. The report must review trends in load requirements and other implications from retail electricity consumers that are large energy use facilities and other retail electricity consumers that use large amounts of electricity. In providing the report, the department must protect proprietary information.
