<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the rapid growth of large energy-consuming customers, including data centers, may necessitate substantial investment in new electrical generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure. The intent of this act is to ensure that the costs and risks of these energy-related investments are borne solely by the customers causing the need for the investment, thereby protecting residential, small commercial, and existing industrial ratepayers from unwarranted rate increases.</p>
