<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that the state's adopt-a-highway program has enabled individuals, groups, and businesses to participate in keeping the state's highways clean and that the program has been successful for over 30 years in helping to reduce litter in Washington. The legislature further finds that the program requires a modernization to ensure the original purpose of providing volunteers and businesses an opportunity to contribute to a cleaner environment, enhanced roadsides, and protection of wildlife habitats is fulfilled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that transportation funding resources are limited and the needs are great. Therefore, the legislature intends to add additional accountability to the program and ensure that the department of transportation's limited resources can be directed to areas with the greatest need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To that end, the legislature intends to (a) prioritize funding for the program in alignment with priorities for the transportation system as a whole, and (b) ensure that volunteers and businesses participating as volunteers and/or sponsors are committed to the goals of the program and are provided the opportunity to participate, to the extent funds are available.</p>
</li>
