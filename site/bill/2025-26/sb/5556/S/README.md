# SB 5556 - Adopt-a-highway program

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5556-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature recognizes that the state's adopt-a-highway program has enabled individuals, groups, and businesses to participate in keeping the state's highways clean and that the program has been successful for over 30 years in helping to reduce litter in Washington. The legislature further finds that the program requires a modernization to ensure the original purpose of providing volunteers and businesses an opportunity to contribute to a cleaner environment, enhanced roadsides, and protection of wildlife habitats is fulfilled.

2. The legislature further finds that transportation funding resources are limited and the needs are great. Therefore, the legislature intends to add additional accountability to the program and ensure that the department of transportation's limited resources can be directed to areas with the greatest need.

3. To that end, the legislature intends to (a) prioritize funding for the program in alignment with priorities for the transportation system as a whole, and (b) ensure that volunteers and businesses participating as volunteers and/or sponsors are committed to the goals of the program and are provided the opportunity to participate, to the extent funds are available.

## Section 2
1. [Empty]

    a. Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose in an omnibus transportation appropriations act, the department of transportation shall establish a statewide adopt-a-highway program. The purpose of the program is to provide volunteers and businesses an opportunity to contribute to a cleaner environment, enhanced roadsides, and protection of wildlife habitats. Participating volunteers and businesses shall adopt department-designated sections of state highways, rest areas, park and ride lots, intermodal facilities, and any other facilities the department deems appropriate, in accordance with rules adopted by the department. The department may elect to coordinate a consortium of participants for adopt-a-highway projects.

    b. The adopt-a-highway program shall include, at a minimum, litter control for the adopted section, and may include additional responsibilities such as planting and maintaining vegetation, controlling weeds, graffiti removal, and any other roadside improvement or clean-up activities the department deems appropriate. Whenever possible, when planting and maintaining vegetation, volunteers and businesses should use native forage plants that are pollen-rich or nectar-rich and beneficial for all pollinators, including honey bees, in order to develop habitat beneficial for the feeding, nesting, and reproduction of pollinators. The department shall not accept adopt-a-highway proposals that would have the effect of terminating classified employees or classified employee positions.
