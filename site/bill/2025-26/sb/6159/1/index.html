<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that hospitals owned and operated by public entities play unique roles in their communities, serving as safety net providers, treating all patients, even those who are medically complex, low income, uninsured, or underinsured. Often these patients cannot access care at other nonpublic facilities and must rely on public hospitals as a result. These hospitals' adherence to this public mission imperils their financial stability, especially as access to public reimbursement programs and other forms of financial support decline. The continued viability of public hospitals and the access to care they provide for all members of their communities are a matter of significant public concern. The legislature finds that competition between public hospitals is not practical or desirable and instead may harm these hospitals' ability to fulfill their public mission. It is the intent of this act to foster the development of cooperative and collaborative arrangements among all public hospitals to support their public mission.  To this end, the legislature intends to authorize these entities to enter agreements, contracts, and other arrangements on a noncompetitive basis.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>In addition to other powers granted to public hospital districts by chapter 39.34 RCW,  public hospital districts that are not affiliated with a nonpublic entity under RCW 70.44.240 may enter into cooperative agreements and contracts with other  public hospital districts and publicly owned or operated health care entities in order to provide for the health care needs of the people served by the hospital districts. These agreements and contracts are specifically authorized to include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Allocation of health care services among the different facilities owned and operated by the districts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combined purchases and allocations of medical equipment and technologies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joint agreements and contracts for health care service delivery and payment with public and private entities; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other cooperative arrangements consistent with the intent of chapter 161, Laws of 1992. The provisions of chapter 39.34 RCW shall apply to the development and implementation of the cooperative contracts and agreements.</p>
