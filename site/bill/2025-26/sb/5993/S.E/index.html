<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, every loan or forbearance of money, goods, or thing in action shall bear interest at the rate of twelve percent per annum where no different rate is agreed to in writing between the parties: PROVIDED, That with regard to any transaction heretofore or hereafter entered into subject to this section, if an agreement in writing between the parties evidencing such transaction provides for the payment of money at the end of an agreed period of time or in installments over an agreed period of time, then such agreement shall constitute a writing for purposes of this section and satisfy the requirements thereof. The discounting of commercial paper, where the borrower makes himself or herself liable as maker, guarantor, or indorser, shall be considered as a loan for the purposes of this chapter.</p>

<li>
<p>For any medical debt accrued after December 31, 2026, interest charged or collected in excess of a simple interest rate of one percent per year on new medical debt, as defined in RCW 19.16.100, whether before or after entry of judgment.</p>

<li>
<p>If a medical debt is later reduced or eliminated under chapter 70.170 RCW, or is later determined to be invalid, not lawfully owed, or not legally enforceable, any interest charged or collected on or after the effective date of this section on the portion of the medical debt reduced or eliminated is void and must be refunded.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>It constitutes a lease-purchase agreement under chapter 63.19 RCW; or</p>
