<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington has committed to decarbonizing its electricity system so that it is carbon neutral by 2030 and carbon free by 2045. Achieving those goals includes retiring coal and gas resources, adding new generation from renewable and nonemitting resources, and leveraging energy storage technologies. At the same time, demand for electricity is increasing significantly due to the electrification of vehicles, home heating and cooling, and manufacturing, and the expansion of the information services sector in Washington. There are significant federal, state, and private investments in clean energy development, including wind, solar, and battery storage, that support decarbonization goals and supply new electrical load. However, Washington's existing transmission system lacks the capacity to accommodate the growing demand for clean electricity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that extreme weather events and changes to seasonal highs and lows puts new strain on the existing transmission system and threatens reliability. Extreme weather events such as high-speed winds, floods, freezing, and heat domes can damage grid infrastructure and cause disruptions to the power supply. Warmer summers and colder winters increase the need for heating and cooling and thereby intensify and extend periods of peak demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that to maintain reliability and build resilience, Washington's transmission system needs to be expanded and upgraded to access diverse portfolios of clean and reliable energy across the region, including solar resources in the southwest and wind resources across the mountain west. A more robust and updated transmission system will support affordability and reliability goals by enabling the efficient dispatch of least-cost resources across the region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to create the Washington electric transmission authority to improve transmission reliability, resilience, and affordability. The Washington electric transmission authority will serve as a centralized body to achieve these goals by engaging in long-term planning; providing development transmission services; coordinating siting and permitting; leveraging research; and engaging with utilities, transmission developers, local jurisdictions, state agencies, regional entities, the federal government, and affected communities. The legislature intends for the authority to achieve the following goals:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Improve reliability and resilience, including during extreme weather events;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase access to low-cost renewable energy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Achieve clean electricity requirements and greenhouse gas emissions limits;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support economic growth; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintain affordable energy rates.</p>
</li>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The department must:</p>
<ol type="a">

<p>Develop a 20-year transmission needs assessment that identifies inefficiencies and deficits in the existing transmission system.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>The needs assessment must:</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) Identify high-priority corridors that are needed to meet current and forecasted transmission demand, including whether new transmission lines could be built on existing rights-of-way;</p>
<p>(B) Identify investments in existing transmission lines, such as grid-enhancing technologies and reconductoring with advanced conductors, that can unlock additional capacity and improve network performance to alleviate the need for new transmission lines;</p>
<p>(C) Identify and evaluate nonwires alternatives that can reduce the need to build new transmission lines, such as demand response, energy storage, microgrids, and energy efficiency;</p>
<p>(D) Engage proactively in conversations with neighboring states to coordinate interconnection planning and development that supports regional resource adequacy and access to least-cost resources;</p>

<p>(G) Consider opportunities to collocate transmission corridors along existing rights-of-way for other infrastructure; and</p>
<p>(H) Align with the state energy strategy as defined in RCW 43.21F.025.</p>
<pre><code>    ii. When developing the needs assessment, the department may consider integrated resource plans developed under chapter 19.280 RCW and consult the board of directors about using existing transmission plans developed by regional or federal entities and must avoid, to the greatest extent practicable, duplicating plans or related analysis already produced by and made available by such entities.

    iii. The department must complete the first needs assessment by October 30, 2026, and then the authority must complete a needs assessment every five years thereafter;

b. Develop a transmission system enhancement roadmap that identifies specific actions and corresponding timelines to meet the needs identified in the transmission needs assessment.

    i. The transmission system enhancement roadmap must prioritize actions based on the following criteria:
</code></pre>
<p>(A) The capacity for a transmission project to cost-effectively help meet Washington's clean electricity targets;</p>
<p>(B) Minimizing impact to natural and cultural resources on tribal lands, to the greatest extent practicable; and</p>
<p>(C) Minimizing environmental impact, to the greatest extent practicable.</p>
<pre><code>    ii. The department must complete a transmission system enhancement roadmap along with the transmission needs assessment by October 30, 2026;

c. Provide assistance to local governments and tribal governments that are permitting the construction and operation of electric transmission projects which includes, but is not limited to, easily accessible information on advanced transmission technologies in Washington and identifying applicable codes and ordinances that support transmission facilities for the purpose of providing frameworks that local and tribal governments may consider and adopt to suit local circumstances;

d. Consult with bond counsel to identify the appropriate state bonding authority needed to improve capacity to develop electric transmission in Washington, including identifying the activities to be funded by electric transmission bonds. By November 1, 2025, the department must prepare request legislation to establish bonding authority for the authority.
