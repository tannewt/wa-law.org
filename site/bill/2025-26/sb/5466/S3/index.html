<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington has committed to decarbonizing its electricity system so that it is carbon neutral by 2030 and carbon free by 2045. Achieving those goals includes retiring coal and gas resources, adding new generation from renewable and nonemitting resources, and leveraging energy storage technologies. At the same time, demand for electricity is increasing significantly due to the electrification of vehicles, home heating and cooling, and manufacturing, and the expansion of the information services sector in Washington. There are significant federal, state, and private investments in clean energy development, including wind, solar, and battery storage, that support decarbonization goals and supply new electrical load. However, Washington's existing transmission system lacks the capacity to accommodate the growing demand for clean electricity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that extreme weather events and changes to seasonal highs and lows puts new strain on the existing transmission system and threatens reliability. Extreme weather events such as high-speed winds, floods, freezing, and heat domes can damage grid infrastructure and cause disruptions to the power supply. Warmer summers and colder winters increase the need for heating and cooling and thereby intensify and extend periods of peak demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that to maintain reliability and build resilience, Washington's transmission system needs to be expanded and upgraded to access diverse portfolios of clean and reliable energy across the region, including solar resources in the southwest and wind resources across the mountain west. A more robust and updated transmission system will support affordability and reliability goals by enabling the efficient dispatch of least-cost resources across the region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to create the Washington electric transmission authority to improve transmission reliability, resilience, and affordability. The Washington electric transmission authority will serve as a centralized body to achieve these goals by: providing development transmission services; coordinating siting and permitting; and engaging with utilities, transmission developers, local jurisdictions, state agencies, regional entities, the federal government, federally recognized Indian tribes, and affected communities. The legislature intends for the authority to achieve the following goals:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Improve reliability and resilience, including during extreme weather events;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase access to low-cost renewable energy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Achieve clean electricity requirements and greenhouse gas emissions limits;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support economic growth; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintain affordable energy rates.</p>

<p>Utility-related activities for existing electric transmission lines of 115,000 volts and above are not eligible for the voluntary process under section 13 of this act if such activities are undertaken wholly or partly on lands covered by water, except when an activity does not result in physical contact with the water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Previously disturbed or developed&quot; refers to land that has been changed such that its functioning ecological processes have been and remain altered by human activity. The phrase encompasses areas that have been transformed from natural cover to nonnative species or a managed state including, but not limited to, utility and electric power transmission corridors and rights-of-way, and other areas where active utilities and currently used roads are readily available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Upgrading or rebuilding&quot; includes any repair, maintenance, replacement, modification or upgrade (including, but not limited to, increases in voltage, reconductoring, installation of grid-enhancing or optimizing technologies, or the relocation or addition of utility poles) to any existing electric transmission powerlines and any associated infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="section-13">Section 13 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-13">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For a project where the potentially impacted federally recognized Indian tribe and the project applicant voluntarily choose to proceed under section 12 of this act, the permitting jurisdiction shall require the project applicant to complete the state environmental policy act checklist limited to historic and cultural preservation as it relates to tribal interests. The following steps must be taken prior to receiving a permit:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>In preparing the checklist, the project applicant must consult with the department of archaeology and historic preservation. The department of archaeology and historic preservation must notify all potentially affected federally recognized Indian tribes and provide an opportunity to request a survey to identify potential impacts within the vertical and horizontal limits of the project area where ground disturbing activities are proposed. The department of archaeology and historic preservation may provide a preliminary estimation regarding potential impacts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A federally recognized Indian tribe notified under (a) of this subsection may request a survey within 30 business days of the notification. If no response is received within 30 business days, the permitting jurisdiction shall proceed without requiring a survey, unless otherwise required by state or federal law. Nothing in this section modifies or limits obligations under RCW 27.53.060.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a survey is requested under (b) of this subsection, the department of archaeology and historic preservation shall consult with potentially affected tribes and the project applicant to coordinate completion of the survey consistent with the goals in RCW 43.158.150(1)(a). The survey may be conducted by the department of archaeology and historic preservation or by the project applicant through a qualified third-party contractor, subject to coordination with the department of archaeology and historic preservation. The department of archaeology and historic preservation or project applicant shall make reasonable efforts to ensure the survey is completed within 60 business days of receiving the tribal request. The affected tribe and the project applicant may commence the voluntary process under (d)(ii) of this subsection at any time prior to completion of the survey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the survey identifies resources or potential impacts of concern, the following applies:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>For resources or impacts subject to RCW 27.53.060 the department of archaeology and historic preservation shall follow the process required by RCW 27.53.060.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For resources or impacts not subject to RCW 27.53.060 the affected tribes and project applicant shall attempt in good faith to develop a plan on a voluntary basis to avoid, mitigate, or minimize potential adverse effects. If a mutually agreed plan is developed, the permitting jurisdiction shall incorporate the plan as a condition of the permit. The voluntary planning process under this subsection must be completed within 60 business days of survey completion, unless extended by mutual agreement. If an affected tribe elects to not participate in the voluntary process, does not respond, or if participation does not result in agreement on the plan, the responsible official shall proceed with the environmental review under this chapter, limited to the impacts identified through the checklist for historic and cultural resources as it relates to tribal interests and survey in (b) of this subsection and impacts reasonably related to those issues, and may impose conditions of approval in a required permit consistent with that review. The responsible official may require documentation of consultation efforts as part of the record.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information provided by federally recognized Indian tribes must be kept confidential and exempt from public disclosure under chapter 42.56 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each project applicant must pay actual costs incurred by the permitting jurisdiction in conducting a resources survey, developing a plan, or both, as required under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Completion of the applicable steps under this section satisfies the applicant's obligations under this section, and the permitting jurisdiction may issue the permit subject to any conditions imposed.</p>
</li>
