# SB 5760 - GA building/reentry center

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5760.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that too often both juvenile inmates and adult inmates do not have readily available access to their legislators and their government. Furthermore, the legislature finds that the state of Washington owns surplus property conveniently located directly on the state capitol campus. Inmates would benefit from being placed directly on the state capitol campus and it would enhance the ability of legislators to meet directly with inmates.

The legislature further finds that the general administration building is a historically significant building that is worth preserving. The building was designed by the prominent Tacoma architect, A. Gordon Lumm and is an important example of modern architecture on the capitol campus. The sparsely decorated exterior and minimalist appearance is representative of the international style and would make a suitable building to house inmates.

Therefore, the legislature finds that a new community facility and work release center should be colocated using the general administration building.

## Section 2
This act may be cited as the inmates in Olympia act.

## Section 3
There is established in Olympia, Thurston county, a dual community institution known as the Washington capitol reentry center.

## Section 4
The purpose of the Washington capitol reentry center is to provide qualifying adult and juvenile inmates with the opportunity to be conveniently located in close proximity to publicly elected officials to ensure their full participation in the legislative process.

## Section 5

The secretary of the department of children, youth, and families and the secretary of the department of corrections shall jointly develop and implement the colocation of a community facility, as defined in RCW 72.05.020, and work release facility under chapter 72.65 RCW at the Washington capitol reentry center.
