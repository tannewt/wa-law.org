## Section 2
1. Donors and distributing organizations are not liable for civil damages or criminal penalties resulting from the nature, age, condition, or packaging of the donated children's items unless a donor or distributing organization acts with gross negligence or intentional misconduct.

2. When accepting and distributing a car seat, a distributing organization must:

    a. Inquire about the history of the car seat when accepting the car seat;

    b. Include a disclosure on the car seat, stating that the organization is not aware of the history of the car seat and therefore cannot make any safety guarantees; and

    c. Confirm that the car seat is not expired and is not subject to a safety recall, and not distribute or donate any car seat which is expired or subject to a safety recall.
