<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that many baby items, such as clothing, cribs, car seats, and toys, are discarded or underutilized while there is a significant need for these items among families in Washington. Donating baby items can help reduce waste, support families in need, and promote community welfare. However, potential donors may hesitate due to fear of civil liability if an item is later found to be defective. Chapter 69.80 RCW provides a successful framework for immunity from liability for donations of perishable food, which has encouraged such donations without compromising public safety. Extending a similar immunity to donations of baby items less than five years old will encourage more donations while ensuring that donors act in good faith and it is the intent of the legislature to promote the donation of safe baby items by limiting tort liability, thereby addressing social and environmental needs in Washington state.</p>
