<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>That there is a workforce crisis in Washington's nursing homes where the majority of workers are older women and disproportionately women of color and immigrants. Overwhelmingly nursing home workers live at or near poverty levels;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Workers in nursing homes are essential health care workers who provide hands-on personal care, supervision, nursing care services, and emotional support to thousands of elderly and younger people with chronic illnesses and disabilities, yet continue to struggle for recognition and compensation even as the demand for long-term care services increases;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investments in worker benefits and wages have improved stability in the Washington in-home workforce by providing access to affordable and high quality employee health care benefits that help stem turnover;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to high quality and affordable health care would help address staff turnover, stabilize the workforce, and improve the quality of nursing home care.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to address this crisis by:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Offering increased funding to nursing home operators who commit to offering high quality and affordable health care to their employees;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encouraging nursing home operators to offer health care in the most cost-effective way possible, through large-scale, multiemployer plans; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requiring that funds appropriated for this purpose are spent as intended and that these funds supplement rather than supplant existing health care funding for employee health care coverage.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the essential worker health care program shall be established within the department to help provide nursing home workers with high quality, affordable health coverage through participating nursing home employers. Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, referencing this act by bill or chapter number, in the omnibus appropriations act, the department shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Distribute funding through a supplemental payment to participating nursing home employers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distribute the supplemental payment annually in proportion to each participating nursing home employer's medicaid bed days in the previous calendar year; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seek any necessary approvals from the centers for medicare and medicaid services to provide this supplemental payment as provided in section 6 of this act.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To offer employee health care benefits through a qualified health fund in the essential worker health care program, employers must operate at least one nursing home licensed under chapter 18.51 RCW in Washington that participates in medicaid and enter into a memorandum of understanding with the department committing to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Participate in a qualified health fund certified by the office of the insurance commissioner;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allocate substantially all of the funds distributed through this program to the qualified health fund;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide documentation to the department of its spending on employee health care benefits in Washington in the two years prior to its entry into the program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintain spending on employee health care benefits in the first year of its participation in the program at least equal to the average of its spending in the two years prior to its entry into the program and maintain spending in subsequent years at least equal to this level plus the consumer price index for health insurance maintained by the United States bureau of labor statistics. Spending to meet this requirement must flow through the certified qualified health fund. For qualified health funds offered through a Taft-Hartley fund in which union representatives occupy at least 50 percent of board seats, a certification from each participating union is sufficient to comply with this requirement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide the department with information concerning its employee health care benefits, covered employee uptake of the employer's health plan, cost to the employer and covered employees, and employer retention of employees in the two years prior to its entry into the program, and provide updates to this information at the end of each year of participation in the program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demonstrate at least annually or more frequently at the request of the department that it has used all of the supplemental payments received through the program to significantly improve the quality of employee health care benefits offered to covered employees; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meet any other conditions or requirements specified by the department in rule to achieve the goals of this program.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only covered employees may participate in the program. A &quot;covered employee&quot; is any permanent employee of a company that operates a participating facility who works primarily in the state of Washington including, but not limited to, employees providing direct care to nursing home residents; employees indirectly involved in resident care; employees providing dietary, housekeeping, laundry, or environmental services on location; administrative employees and management; and corporate office employees, or any subcontractor of such a company who works on a full-time, permanent basis in a nursing home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may take any enforcement action authorized under this chapter or terminate any participating employer that fails to comply with the requirements established in the memorandum of understanding, sections 2 and 3 of this act, and any related rules adopted by the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the department may adopt rules to administer and implement this act.</p>
</li>
</ol>
