<p>The department shall coordinate with the Brian Abbott fish passage barrier removal board to use a watershed approach by replacing both state and local culverts guided by the principle of providing the greatest fish habitat gain at the earliest time. The department shall deliver high habitat value fish passage barrier corrections that it has identified, guided by the following factors: Opportunity to bundle projects, tribal priorities, ability to leverage investments by others, presence of other barriers, project readiness, culvert conditions, other transportation projects in the area, and transportation impacts.

The legislature finds that the replacement of the I-5 Columbia river bridge is a project of national significance and is critical for the movement of freight. One span is now more than a century old, at risk for collapse in the event of a major earthquake, and no longer satisfies the needs of commerce and travel. Replacing the aging interstate bridge with a modern, seismically resilient, multimodal structure that provides improved mobility for people, goods, and services is a high priority.

<p>Work for less than $100,000 may be performed on ferry vessels and terminals by state forces. During the 2025-2027 fiscal biennium, work for less than $500,000 may be performed on ferry vessels and terminals by state forces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the estimated cost of work to be performed on ferry vessels and terminals is between $100,000 and $200,000, or between $500,000 and $600,000 during the 2025-2027 fiscal biennium, the department shall contact, by mail or email, contractors that appear on the department's small works roster as created pursuant to procedures in chapter 39.04 RCW to do specific work the contractors are qualified to do to determine if any contractor is interested and capable of doing the work. If there is a response of interest within 72 hours, the small works roster procedures commence. If no qualified contractors respond with interest and availability to do the work, the department may use its regular contracting procedures. If the secretary determines that the work to be completed is an emergency, procedures governing emergencies apply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall hire a disinterested, third party to conduct an independent analysis to identify methods of reducing out-of-service times for vessel maintenance, preservation, and improvement projects. The analysis must include options that consider consolidating work while vessels are at shipyards by having state forces perform services traditionally performed at Eagle Harbor at the shipyard and decreasing the allowable time at shipyards. The analysis must also compare the out-of-service vessel times of performing services by state forces versus contracting out those services which in turn must be used to form a recommendation as to what the threshold of work performed on ferry vessels and terminals by state forces should be. This analysis must be presented to the transportation committees of the senate and house of representatives by December 1, 2010.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall develop a proposed ferry vessel maintenance, preservation, and improvement program and present it to the transportation committees of the senate and house of representatives by December 1, 2010. The proposed program must:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Improve the basis for budgeting vessel maintenance, preservation, and improvement costs and for projecting those costs into a 16-year financial plan;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit the amount of planned out-of-service time to the greatest extent possible, including options associated with department staff as well as commercial shipyards; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be based on the service plan in the capital plan, recognizing that vessel preservation and improvement needs may vary by route.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In developing the proposed ferry vessel maintenance, preservation, and improvement program, the department shall consider the following, related to reducing vessel out-of-service time:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The costs compared to benefits of Eagle Harbor repair and maintenance facility operations options to include staffing costs and benefits in terms of reduced out-of-service time;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maintenance requirements for on-vessel staff, including the benefits of a systemwide standard;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The costs compared to benefits of staff performing preservation or maintenance work, or both, while the vessel is underway, tied up between sailings, or not deployed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A review of the department's vessel maintenance, preservation, and improvement program contracting process and contractual requirements;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The costs compared to benefits of allowing for increased costs associated with expedited delivery;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="i" start="6">
<li>
<p>A method for comparing the anticipated out-of-service time of proposed projects and other projects planned during the same construction period;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coordination with required United States coast guard dry dockings;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A method for comparing how proposed projects relate to the service requirements of the route on which the vessel normally operates; and</p>

Any vacancy shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term by the appointing authority. Not more than two members of any terminal-area committee may be from the same political party at the time of their appointment, and in a county having more than one committee, the overall party representation shall be as nearly equal as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The chairs of the several committees constitute an executive committee of the Washington state ferry users. The executive committee shall meet twice each year with representatives of the marine division of the department to review ferry system issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
