<pre><code>    ii. Has passed  steps one and two of the United States medical licensing examination; and

    iii. Submits to the commission background check process required of applicants generally.

b. The commission at its sole discretion may elect to waive requirements in statute and rule when considering internationally trained applicants experiencing hardship in providing required documents for license applications. The commission may also require alternate demonstrations of competence that may include examinations or specialty assessments, a period of supervised practice, or other tools as appropriate for evaluation of an applicant to the satisfaction of the commission. Hardship scenarios the commission may consider include, but are not limited to, refugee status, persecution in the home country of the applicant due to beliefs, ethnicity, or other demographic considerations. The commission may not consider as a hardship the inability of the applicant to complete the certification and examination processes administered by the educational commission on foreign medical graduates or the failure of required examinations.

c. A license holder under this subsection may only practice:

    i. Under the supervision and control of a physician who is licensed in this state under this chapter or chapter 18.57 RCW and is of the same or substantially similar clinical specialty; and

    ii. Within the nominating facility or organization.

d. A license holder must file with the commission a practice agreement between the license holder and the supervising physician who is of the same or substantially similar clinical specialty prior to beginning practice under this license.

e. A supervising physician may supervise no more than four license holders under this subsection unless the commission grants a request to increase this limit.

f. A limited license issued under this subsection is valid for two years and may be renewed three times by the commission upon application for renewal by the nominating entity for a total of eight years. Prior to the third renewal, the applicant must attest to the commission that they applied to one or more residency programs.

g. The scope of practice of an individual licensed and practicing under authority of this license shall be defined in the practice agreement between the supervising physician and the licensee. For purposes of medical practice, employment role definition, malpractice coverage, credentialing, and insurance billing for plans described in, but not limited to, Title 48 RCW, the licensee shall be considered a full scope physician, unless disciplinary action limits the scope of the license held by the licensee or the supervising physician.

h. All persons licensed under this subsection are subject to the jurisdiction of the commission to the same extent as other members of the medical profession, in accordance with this chapter and chapter 18.130 RCW.

    i. Persons applying for licensure and renewing licenses under this subsection shall comply with administrative procedures, administrative requirements, and fees determined as provided in RCW 43.70.250 and 43.70.280.

j. The supervising physician shall retain professional and personal responsibility for any act which constitutes the practice of medicine as defined in RCW 18.71.011 or the practice of osteopathic medicine and surgery as defined in RCW 18.57.001 when performed by an international medical graduate practicing under their supervision.
