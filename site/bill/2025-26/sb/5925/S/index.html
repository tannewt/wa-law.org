</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>At any time before the return date specified in the demand, or within 30 days after the demand has been served, whichever period is shorter, a petition to extend the return date for, or to modify or set aside a demand issued pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, stating good cause, may be filed in the superior court for Thurston county, or in such other county where the parties reside. A petition, by the person or entity on whom the demand is served, stating good cause, to require the attorney general or any person to perform any duty imposed by the provisions of this section, and all other petitions in connection with a demand, may be filed in the superior court for Thurston county, or in the county where the parties reside. The court shall have jurisdiction to impose such sanctions as are provided for in the civil rules for superior court with respect to discovery motions.</p>

<p>Whenever any person or entity fails to comply with any civil investigative demand for documentary material, answers to written interrogatories, or oral testimony duly served upon him, her, or it under this section, or whenever satisfactory copying or reproduction of any such material cannot be done and such person or entity refuses to surrender such material, the attorney general may file, in the trial court of general jurisdiction of the county in which such person or entity resides, is found, or transacts business, and serve upon such person or entity a petition for an order of such court for the enforcement of this section, except that if such person or entity transacts business in more than one county such petition shall be filed in the county in which such person or entity maintains his, her, or its principal place of business, or in such other county as may be agreed upon by the parties to such petition. Whenever any petition is filed in the trial court of general jurisdiction of any county under this section, such court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter so presented and to enter such order or orders as may be required to carry into effect the provisions of this section, and may impose such sanctions as are provided for in the civil rules for superior court with respect to discovery motions.</p>
