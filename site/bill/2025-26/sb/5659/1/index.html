<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington has a severe homelessness crisis and housing shortage. By some estimates, our state needs more than 1,000,000 new homes. While many policy proposals have been offered in good faith as solutions to the housing shortage, the stubborn truth is that Washington simply needs to build more housing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local governments will play a key role in eliminating Washington's housing shortage because local governments usually exercise approval authority over new home construction. Additionally, the legislature recognizes that some state laws may constrain local governments' ability to approve construction of new housing. Both levels of government should work together to create public policies that help build more homes in Washington.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to encourage local and state government to promote the construction of new homes and end the housing shortage over the next 10 years.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Every county, city, and town, that has authority to approve or deny permits or other similar approvals necessary for the construction of new homes shall approve the construction of enough new homes to eliminate the county, city, or town's proportional share of Washington's total housing shortage, as calculated under subsection (2) of this section, through 2035.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of commerce shall establish each county, city, and town's proportional share of Washington's total housing shortage using the best available data. Best available data may include analyses and projections produced by private sector sources with expertise in housing supply trends, and may include data collected under other programs, such as data collected under chapter 36.70A RCW. The department shall complete its calculation no later than April 1, 2026, and shall report the number of new homes that must be created in each county, city, and town through 2035 in order to eliminate Washington's total housing shortage. The department shall also post the same information to the department's public website no later than May 1, 2026.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning May 1, 2026, a county, city, or town, that is subject to the requirements of this section shall regularly evaluate its locally enacted codes, ordinances, plans, and regulations to determine whether its locally enacted requirements are impeding the county, city, or town's ability to approve enough construction to eliminate its proportional share of Washington's total housing shortage by 2035. Where a county, city, or town determines that its locally enacted requirements impair the construction of more housing, the county, city, or town is encouraged to amend its locally enacted requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning May 1, 2026, a county, city, or town, that is subject to the requirements of this section must record the total number of building permit applications it has received and the number of building permit applications it has denied. If more than 33 percent of the applications are being denied, the county, city, or town is encouraged to evaluate and address the factors that lead to denial and increase the number of permit applications it approves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section shall be construed to abrogate or supersede any other provision of the Revised Code of Washington; however, when a county, city, or town identifies a state-enacted requirement that will impede the county, city, or town's ability to approve the construction of a sufficient number of new homes to eliminate the county, city, or town's proportional share of Washington's total housing shortage by 2035, the county, city, or town shall report its findings to the department of commerce. The department shall promptly forward such reports to the governor, lieutenant governor, chief clerk of the house of representatives, and secretary of the senate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to review the reports received under subsection (5) of this section and take appropriate action to amend state-enacted requirements for the purpose of ensuring that counties, cities, and towns subject to this section will be able to eliminate their proportional share of Washington's total housing shortage by 2035.</p>
