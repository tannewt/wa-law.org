<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>To optimize the health of women and infants, it is important to improve the continuum of care from encouraging a healthy pregnancy to having a healthy birth and receiving postpartum care. Prenatal care can help prevent and address health problems for both women and their infants. It is most effective when it starts early and can be continued through the entire pregnancy. It is also recognized that interventions to increase access to health care can help more women get the prenatal care they need. After the birth, it is also important that postpartum care is an ongoing process with services and supports that women receive specific to their individual needs so that they can recover from birth and nurture their infants. The time following birth is a critical period for a woman and her infant, and it sets the stage for long-term health and well-being;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women in the United States behind only skin cancer. Breast cancer is also the second-leading cause of cancer death in women;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other cancers, like cervical cancer, rarely occur in women who have been getting regular screenings before age 65;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state of Washington has substantial public interest in the quality, price, and cost of health care, and ensuring that managed care organizations are delivering quality health care. Oversight of performance management of managed care organizations providing health care services to medicaid clients contracted by the health care authority is necessary to provide accountability for state purchased health care;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Services provided in a fee-for-service environment also require oversight and accountability; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health care costs are rising, and that containing health care costs while ensuring positive health outcomes, appropriate performance management, and accountability for dollars spent on state purchased health care is essential. The legislature must hold both the health care authority and the managed care organizations that provide services to medicaid clients accountable for performance and performance improvement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature therefore intends to ensure medicaid clients receive appropriate care in the right setting, at the right time, for the right cost by providing oversight for performance management and accountability for state purchased health care.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
