# SB 5541 - Future fund pilot project

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5541.pdf)

## Section 1
1. In 2022, the legislature directed the office of the state treasurer to study wealth inequity in the state and explore how a baby bond program could address these inequities.

2. The study:

    a. Found that almost half of Washingtonians are born into households qualifying for medicaid, a key poverty indicator;

    b. Found that those born into poverty face life-long impacts including lower rates of homeownership, educational attainment, and entrepreneurship which interfere with their ability to obtain financial stability; and

    c. Suggested that a baby bond program, such as the 2023 Washington future fund proposal, could interrupt the intergenerational cycle of poverty and address the aforementioned opportunity deficit by providing Washingtonians who were born into and experience persistent poverty the seed capital to invest in themselves and their communities by purchasing a home, pursuing education, or starting a small business.

3. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to further investigate the finding with the Washington future fund pilot project: An opportunity to evaluate the impact a baby bond-level grant can have on the economic stability of a sample of eligible Washingtonians.
