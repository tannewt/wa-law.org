# SB 5747 - Affordable housing/exemption

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5747.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that there is a housing crisis in Washington state. The primary reason for that crisis is a lack of affordable housing units. One reason that housing units are not being built to meet demand is because of onerous building codes. In order to encourage development of affordable housing, the legislature finds that cities and counties may enforce any of the last four iterations of the state building and energy code.
