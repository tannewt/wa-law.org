<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that changes to the residential landlord-tenant act since 2018 have lengthened the amount of time that it takes to complete an unlawful detainer action and complicated the process for both landlords and tenants. The legislature further finds that these changes have restricted the ability of both not-for-profit and for-profit housing providers to operate safe and functional rental housing. The legislature finds that affordable housing communities are currently suffering the most from the impact of the current regulatory regime, with many affordable housing organizations questioning their ability to continue to operate.</p>

<p>The plaintiff, at the time of commencing an action of forcible entry or detainer or unlawful detainer, or at any time afterwards, upon filing the complaint, may apply to the superior court in which the action is pending for an order directing the defendant to appear and show cause, if any he or she has, why a writ of restitution should not issue restoring to the plaintiff possession of the property in the complaint described, and the judge shall by order fix a time and place for a hearing of the motion, which shall not be less than seven nor more than 30 days from the date of presentation of the motion. A copy of the order, together with a copy of the summons and complaint if not previously served upon the defendant, shall be served upon the defendant not less than seven days prior to the date of the hearing. The order shall notify the defendant that if he or she fails to file a written answer, appear, and show cause at the time and place specified by the order the court may order the sheriff to restore possession of the property to the plaintiff and may grant such other relief as may be prayed for in the complaint and provided by this chapter.</p>
<h2 id="section-6">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At the time and place fixed for the hearing of plaintiff's motion for a writ of restitution, the defendant, or any person in possession or claiming possession of the property, may present evidence in support of any legal or equitable defense or set-off arising out of the tenancyand specified in the written answer. If a written answer is not filed prior to the date of the hearing, the defendant, or any person in possession or claiming possession of the property, shall be limited to disputing whether the plaintiff has met the burden of proof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court shall examine the parties and witnesses orally to ascertain the merits of the complaint and answer, and if it shall appear by a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff has the right to be restored to possession of the property, the court shall enter an order directing the issuance of a writ of restitution, returnable 10 days after its date, restoring to the plaintiff possession of the property . If it shall appear to the court that there is no substantial issue of material fact of the right of the plaintiff to be granted other relief as prayed for in the complaint and provided for in this chapter, the court may enter an order and judgment granting so much of such relief as may be sustained by the proof, and the court may grant such other relief as may be prayed for in the plaintiff's complaint and provided for in this chapter, then the court shall enter an order denying any relief sought by the plaintiff for which the court has determined that the plaintiff has no right as a matter of law: PROVIDED, That within three days after the service of the writ of restitution issued prior to final judgment, the defendant, or person in possession of the property, may, in any action for the recovery of possession of the property for failure to pay rent, stay the execution of the writ pending final judgment by paying into court or to the plaintiff, as the court directs, all rent found to be due, and in addition by paying, on a monthly basis pending final judgment, an amount equal to the monthly rent called for by the lease or rental agreement at the time the complaint was filed: PROVIDED FURTHER, That before any writ shall issue prior to final judgment the plaintiff shall execute to the defendant and file in the court a bond in such sum as the court may order, with sufficient surety to be approved by the clerk, conditioned that the plaintiff will prosecute his or her action without delay, and will pay all costs that may be adjudged to the defendant, and all damages which he or she may sustain by reason of the writ of restitution having been issued, should the same be wrongfully sued out. The court shall also enter an order directing the parties to proceed to trial on the complaint and answer in the usual manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it appears to the court that by a preponderance of the evidence the plaintiff should not be restored to possession of the property, the court shall deny plaintiff's motion for a writ of restitution and enter an order directing the parties to proceed to trial within thirty days on the complaint and answer. If it appears to the court that there is a substantial issue of material fact as to whether or not the plaintiff is entitled to other relief as is prayed for in plaintiff's complaint and provided for in this chapter, or that there is a genuine issue of a material fact pertaining to a legal or equitable defense or set-off raised in the defendant's answer, the court shall grant or deny so much of plaintiff's other relief sought and so much of defendant's defenses or set-off claimed, as may be proper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court orders trial on any issue, it shall still grant relief as described above for any issue which it determines does not require trial. In its order setting trial, the court shall identify with specificity each issue requiring trial and shall grant appropriate relief to the appropriate party on all other issues. The provisions of superior court civil rule 54(b) do not apply to any order entered at a show cause hearing held pursuant to this section.</p>

<li>
<p>A landlord may evict a tenant, refuse to continue a tenancy, or end a periodic tenancy for any of the following causes:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The tenant continues in possession in person or by subtenant after a default in the payment of rent, and after written notice requiring, in the alternative, the payment of the rent or the surrender of the detained premises has remained uncomplied with for the period set forth in RCW 59.12.030(3) for tenants subject to this chapter. The written notice may be served at any time after the rent becomes due;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tenant continues in possession after substantial breach of a material program requirement of subsidized housing, material term subscribed to by the tenant within the lease or rental agreement, or a tenant obligation imposed by law, other than one for monetary damages, and after the landlord has served written notice specifying the acts or omissions constituting the breach and requiring, in the alternative, that the breach be remedied or the rental agreement will end, and the breach has not been adequately remedied by the date specified in the notice, which date must be at least 10 days after service of the notice;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tenant continues in possession after having received at least three days' advance written notice to quit after he or she commits or permits waste or nuisance upon the premises, unlawful activity that affects the use and enjoyment of the premises, or other substantial or repeated and unreasonable interference with the health, safety, and welfare of, or use and enjoyment of the premises by, the landlord or neighbors of the tenant;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tenant continues in possession after the landlord of a dwelling unit in good faith seeks possession so that the owner or his or her immediate family may occupy the unit as that person's principal residence and no substantially equivalent unit is vacant and available to house the owner or his or her immediate family in the same building, and the owner has provided at least 90 days' advance written notice of the date the tenant's possession is to end. There is a rebuttable presumption that the owner did not act in good faith if the owner or immediate family fails to occupy the unit as a principal residence for at least 60 consecutive days during the 90 days immediately after the tenant vacated the unit pursuant to a notice to vacate using this subsection (2)(d) as the cause for the lease ending;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tenant continues in possession after the owner elects to sell a single dwelling unit, which includes but is not limited to a single-family residence, a condominium unit, a townhouse unit, or any other similar type of dwelling unit, and the landlord has provided at least 90 days' advance written notice of the date the tenant's possession is to end. For the purposes of this subsection (2)(e), an owner &quot;elects to sell&quot; when the owner makes reasonable attempts to sell the unit within 30 days after the tenant has vacated, including, at a minimum, listing it for sale at a reasonable price with a realty agency or advertising it for sale at a reasonable price by listing it on the real estate multiple listing service. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the owner did not intend to sell the unit if:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Within 30 days after the tenant has vacated, the owner does not list the  unit for sale at a reasonable price with a realty agency or advertise it for sale at a reasonable price by listing it on the real estate multiple listing service; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within 90 days after the date the tenant vacated or the date the property was listed for sale, whichever is later, the owner withdraws the  unit from the market, the landlord rents the unit to someone other than the former tenant, or the landlord otherwise indicates that the owner does not intend to sell the unit;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tenant continues in possession of the premises after the landlord serves the tenant with advance written notice pursuant to RCW 59.18.200(2)(c);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tenant continues in possession after the owner elects to withdraw the premises to pursue a conversion pursuant to RCW 64.34.440 or 64.90.655;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tenant continues in possession, after the landlord has provided at least 30 days' advance written notice to vacate that: (i) The premises has been certified or condemned as uninhabitable by a local agency charged with the authority to issue such an order; and (ii) continued habitation of the premises would subject the landlord to civil or criminal penalties. However, if the terms of the local agency's order do not allow the landlord to provide at least 30 days' advance written notice, the landlord must provide as much advance written notice as is possible and still comply with the order;</p>

<p>A landlord may evict a tenant, refuse to continue a tenancy, or end a periodic tenancy for any of the following causes:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The tenant continues in possession in person or by subtenant after a default in the payment of rent, and after written notice requiring, in the alternative, the payment of the rent or the surrender of the detained premises has remained uncomplied with for the period set forth in RCW 59.12.030(3) for tenants subject to this chapter. The written notice may be served at any time after the rent becomes due;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tenant continues in possession after substantial breach of a material program requirement of subsidized housing, material term subscribed to by the tenant within the lease or rental agreement, or a tenant obligation imposed by law, other than one for monetary damages, and after the landlord has served written notice specifying the acts or omissions constituting the breach and requiring, in the alternative, that the breach be remedied or the rental agreement will end, and the breach has not been adequately remedied by the date specified in the notice, which date must be at least 10 days after service of the notice;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tenant continues in possession after having received at least three days' advance written notice to quit after he or she commits or permits waste or nuisance upon the premises, unlawful activity that affects the use and enjoyment of the premises, or other substantial or repeated and unreasonable interference with the health, safety, and welfare of, or use and enjoyment of the premises by, the landlord or neighbors of the tenant;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tenant continues in possession after the landlord of a dwelling unit in good faith seeks possession so that the owner or his or her immediate family may occupy the unit as that person's principal residence and no substantially equivalent unit is vacant and available to house the owner or his or her immediate family in the same building, and the owner has provided at least 90 days' advance written notice of the date the tenant's possession is to end. There is a rebuttable presumption that the owner did not act in good faith if the owner or immediate family fails to occupy the unit as a principal residence for at least 60 consecutive days during the 90 days immediately after the tenant vacated the unit pursuant to a notice to vacate using this subsection (2)(d) as the cause for the lease ending;</p>

<p>The tenant continues in possession after the owner elects to sell a single dwelling unit, which includes but is not limited to a single-family residence, a condominium unit, a townhouse unit, or any other similar type of dwelling unit, and the landlord has provided at least 90 days' advance written notice of the date the tenant's possession is to end. For the purposes of this subsection (2)(e), an owner &quot;elects to sell&quot; when the owner makes reasonable attempts to sell the unit within 30 days after the tenant has vacated, including, at a minimum, listing it for sale at a reasonable price with a realty agency or advertising it for sale at a reasonable price by listing it on the real estate multiple listing service. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the owner did not intend to sell the unit if:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Within 30 days after the tenant has vacated, the owner does not list the  unit for sale at a reasonable price with a realty agency or advertise it for sale at a reasonable price by listing it on the real estate multiple listing service; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within 90 days after the date the tenant vacated or the date the property was listed for sale, whichever is later, the owner withdraws the  unit from the market, the landlord rents the unit to someone other than the former tenant, or the landlord otherwise indicates that the owner does not intend to sell the unit;</p>

<li>
<p>The tenant continues in possession of the premises after the landlord serves the tenant with advance written notice pursuant to RCW 59.18.200(2)(c);</p>

<li>
<p>The tenant continues in possession after the owner elects to withdraw the premises to pursue a conversion pursuant to RCW 64.90.655;</p>

<li>
<p>The tenant continues in possession, after the landlord has provided at least 30 days' advance written notice to vacate that: (i) The premises has been certified or condemned as uninhabitable by a local agency charged with the authority to issue such an order; and (ii) continued habitation of the premises would subject the landlord to civil or criminal penalties. However, if the terms of the local agency's order do not allow the landlord to provide at least 30 days' advance written notice, the landlord must provide as much advance written notice as is possible and still comply with the order;</p>
