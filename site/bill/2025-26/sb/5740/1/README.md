# SB 5740 - Eviction reform

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5740.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that changes to the residential landlord-tenant act since 2018 have lengthened the amount of time that it takes to complete an unlawful detainer action and complicated the process for both landlords and tenants. The legislature further finds that these changes have restricted the ability of both not-for-profit and for-profit housing providers to operate safe and functional rental housing. The legislature finds that affordable housing communities are currently suffering the most from the impact of the current regulatory regime, with many affordable housing organizations questioning their ability to continue to operate.

## Section 2

## Section 5
The plaintiff, at the time of commencing an action of forcible entry or detainer or unlawful detainer, or at any time afterwards, upon filing the complaint, may apply to the superior court in which the action is pending for an order directing the defendant to appear and show cause, if any he or she has, why a writ of restitution should not issue restoring to the plaintiff possession of the property in the complaint described, and the judge shall by order fix a time and place for a hearing of the motion, which shall not be less than seven nor more than 30 days from the date of presentation of the motion. A copy of the order, together with a copy of the summons and complaint if not previously served upon the defendant, shall be served upon the defendant not less than seven days prior to the date of the hearing. The order shall notify the defendant that if he or she fails to file a written answer, appear, and show cause at the time and place specified by the order the court may order the sheriff to restore possession of the property to the plaintiff and may grant such other relief as may be prayed for in the complaint and provided by this chapter.

## Section 6
1. At the time and place fixed for the hearing of plaintiff's motion for a writ of restitution, the defendant, or any person in possession or claiming possession of the property, may present evidence in support of any legal or equitable defense or set-off arising out of the tenancyand specified in the written answer. If a written answer is not filed prior to the date of the hearing, the defendant, or any person in possession or claiming possession of the property, shall be limited to disputing whether the plaintiff has met the burden of proof.

2. The court shall examine the parties and witnesses orally to ascertain the merits of the complaint and answer, and if it shall appear by a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff has the right to be restored to possession of the property, the court shall enter an order directing the issuance of a writ of restitution, returnable 10 days after its date, restoring to the plaintiff possession of the property . If it shall appear to the court that there is no substantial issue of material fact of the right of the plaintiff to be granted other relief as prayed for in the complaint and provided for in this chapter, the court may enter an order and judgment granting so much of such relief as may be sustained by the proof, and the court may grant such other relief as may be prayed for in the plaintiff's complaint and provided for in this chapter, then the court shall enter an order denying any relief sought by the plaintiff for which the court has determined that the plaintiff has no right as a matter of law: PROVIDED, That within three days after the service of the writ of restitution issued prior to final judgment, the defendant, or person in possession of the property, may, in any action for the recovery of possession of the property for failure to pay rent, stay the execution of the writ pending final judgment by paying into court or to the plaintiff, as the court directs, all rent found to be due, and in addition by paying, on a monthly basis pending final judgment, an amount equal to the monthly rent called for by the lease or rental agreement at the time the complaint was filed: PROVIDED FURTHER, That before any writ shall issue prior to final judgment the plaintiff shall execute to the defendant and file in the court a bond in such sum as the court may order, with sufficient surety to be approved by the clerk, conditioned that the plaintiff will prosecute his or her action without delay, and will pay all costs that may be adjudged to the defendant, and all damages which he or she may sustain by reason of the writ of restitution having been issued, should the same be wrongfully sued out. The court shall also enter an order directing the parties to proceed to trial on the complaint and answer in the usual manner.

3. If it appears to the court that by a preponderance of the evidence the plaintiff should not be restored to possession of the property, the court shall deny plaintiff's motion for a writ of restitution and enter an order directing the parties to proceed to trial within thirty days on the complaint and answer. If it appears to the court that there is a substantial issue of material fact as to whether or not the plaintiff is entitled to other relief as is prayed for in plaintiff's complaint and provided for in this chapter, or that there is a genuine issue of a material fact pertaining to a legal or equitable defense or set-off raised in the defendant's answer, the court shall grant or deny so much of plaintiff's other relief sought and so much of defendant's defenses or set-off claimed, as may be proper.

4. If the court orders trial on any issue, it shall still grant relief as described above for any issue which it determines does not require trial. In its order setting trial, the court shall identify with specificity each issue requiring trial and shall grant appropriate relief to the appropriate party on all other issues. The provisions of superior court civil rule 54(b) do not apply to any order entered at a show cause hearing held pursuant to this section.

5. The hearing described in this section may not be continued on grounds of availability or unavailability of indigent counsel appointed pursuant to RCW 59.18.640 unless counsel for the defendant was assigned at least seven days prior to the date of the hearing.

Violations may be prosecuted under chapter 9A.48 RCW if the destruction is intentional and malicious;

5. Not permit a nuisance or common waste;

6. Not engage in drug-related activity at the rental premises, or allow a subtenant, sublessee, resident, or anyone else to engage in drug-related activity at the rental premises with the knowledge or consent of the tenant. "Drug-related activity" means that activity which constitutes a violation of chapter 69.41, 69.50, or 69.52 RCW;

7. Maintain the smoke detection device in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations, including the replacement of batteries where required for the proper operation of the smoke detection device, as required in RCW 43.44.110(3);

9. Not engage in any gang-related activity at the premises, as defined in RCW 59.18.030, or allow another to engage in such activity at the premises, that renders people in at least two or more dwelling units or residences insecure in life or the use of property or that injures or endangers the safety or health of people in at least two or more dwelling units or residences. In determining whether a tenant is engaged in gang-related activity, a court should consider the totality of the circumstances, including factors such as whether there have been a significant number of complaints to the landlord about the tenant's activities at the property, damages done by the tenant to the property, including the property of other tenants or neighbors, harassment or threats made by the tenant to other tenants or neighbors that have been reported to law enforcement agencies, any police incident reports involving the tenant, and the tenant's criminal history; and

10.

## Section 9
1.

Except as provided in (a) through (c) of this subsection (1), substantial noncompliance by the tenant of RCW 59.18.130 or 59.18.140 constitutes a ground for commencing an action in unlawful detainer in accordance with chapter 59.12 RCW. A landlord may commence such action at any time after written notice pursuant to chapter 59.12 RCW.

    a. If drug-related activity is alleged to be a basis for termination of tenancy under RCW 59.18.130(6), 59.12.030(5), or 59.20.140(5), the compliance provisions of this section do not apply and the landlord may proceed directly to an unlawful detainer action.

    b. If criminal activity on the premises as described in RCW 59.18.130(8) is alleged to be the basis for termination of the tenancy, and the  activity results in the tenant's custodial or noncustodial arrest, then the compliance provisions of this section do not apply and the landlord may proceed directly to an unlawful detainer action against the tenant who was arrested for this activity.

    c. If gang-related activity, as prohibited under RCW 59.18.130(9), is alleged to be the basis for termination of the tenancy, then the compliance provisions of this section do not apply and the landlord may proceed directly to an unlawful detainer action in accordance with chapter 59.12 RCW, and a landlord may commence such an action at any time after written notice under chapter 59.12 RCW.

2. A landlord may not be held liable in any cause of action for bringing an unlawful detainer action against a tenant for drug-related activity, for creating an imminent hazard to the physical safety of others, or for engaging in gang-related activity that renders people in at least two or more dwelling units or residences insecure in life or the use of property or that injures or endangers the safety or health of people in at least two or more dwelling units or residences under this section, if the unlawful detainer action was brought in good faith. Nothing in this section shall affect a landlord's liability under RCW 59.18.380 to pay all damages sustained by the tenant should the writ of restitution be wrongfully sued out.

## Section 10
1. [Empty]

    a. A landlord may  evict a tenant, refuse to continue a tenancy, or end a periodic tenancy only for the causes enumerated in this chapter. A landlord may end a tenancy without cause only as provided in (b) and (c) of this subsection (1).

    b. If a landlord and tenant enter into a rental agreement that provides for the tenancy to continue for an indefinite period on a month-to-month or periodic basis after the agreement expires,

and the landlord has provided the tenant before the end of the initial lease period at least 60 days' advance written notice ending the tenancy, served in a manner consistent with RCW 59.12.040, then a landlord may end such a tenancy at the end of the initial period of the rental agreement without cause.

    c. If a landlord and tenant enter into a rental agreement for a specified period in which the tenancy by the terms of the rental agreement does not continue for an indefinite period on a month-to-month or periodic basis after the end of the specified period,

and the landlord has provided the tenant before the end of the specified period at least 60 days' advance written notice that the tenancy will be deemed expired at the end of such specified period, served in a manner consistent with RCW 59.12.040

, then a landlord may end such a tenancy at the end of the initial period of the rental agreement without cause.

    d. For all other tenancies of a specified period not covered under (b) or (c) of this subsection, and for tenancies of an indefinite period on a month-to-month or periodic basis, a landlord may not end the tenancy except for the causes enumerated in this chapter. Upon the end date of the tenancy of a specified period, the tenancy becomes a month-to-month tenancy.

    e. Nothing prohibits a landlord and tenant from entering into subsequent lease agreements that are in compliance with the requirements in subsection (2) of this section.

    f. A tenant may end a tenancy for a specified time by providing notice in writing not less than 20 days prior to the ending date of the specified time.

2. A landlord may evict a tenant, refuse to continue a tenancy, or end a periodic tenancy for any of the following causes:

    a. The tenant continues in possession in person or by subtenant after a default in the payment of rent, and after written notice requiring, in the alternative, the payment of the rent or the surrender of the detained premises has remained uncomplied with for the period set forth in RCW 59.12.030(3) for tenants subject to this chapter. The written notice may be served at any time after the rent becomes due;

    b. The tenant continues in possession after substantial breach of a material program requirement of subsidized housing, material term subscribed to by the tenant within the lease or rental agreement, or a tenant obligation imposed by law, other than one for monetary damages, and after the landlord has served written notice specifying the acts or omissions constituting the breach and requiring, in the alternative, that the breach be remedied or the rental agreement will end, and the breach has not been adequately remedied by the date specified in the notice, which date must be at least 10 days after service of the notice;

    c. The tenant continues in possession after having received at least three days' advance written notice to quit after he or she commits or permits waste or nuisance upon the premises, unlawful activity that affects the use and enjoyment of the premises, or other substantial or repeated and unreasonable interference with the health, safety, and welfare of, or use and enjoyment of the premises by, the landlord or neighbors of the tenant;

    d. The tenant continues in possession after the landlord of a dwelling unit in good faith seeks possession so that the owner or his or her immediate family may occupy the unit as that person's principal residence and no substantially equivalent unit is vacant and available to house the owner or his or her immediate family in the same building, and the owner has provided at least 90 days' advance written notice of the date the tenant's possession is to end. There is a rebuttable presumption that the owner did not act in good faith if the owner or immediate family fails to occupy the unit as a principal residence for at least 60 consecutive days during the 90 days immediately after the tenant vacated the unit pursuant to a notice to vacate using this subsection (2)(d) as the cause for the lease ending;

    e. The tenant continues in possession after the owner elects to sell a single dwelling unit, which includes but is not limited to a single-family residence, a condominium unit, a townhouse unit, or any other similar type of dwelling unit, and the landlord has provided at least 90 days' advance written notice of the date the tenant's possession is to end. For the purposes of this subsection (2)(e), an owner "elects to sell" when the owner makes reasonable attempts to sell the unit within 30 days after the tenant has vacated, including, at a minimum, listing it for sale at a reasonable price with a realty agency or advertising it for sale at a reasonable price by listing it on the real estate multiple listing service. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the owner did not intend to sell the unit if:

        i. Within 30 days after the tenant has vacated, the owner does not list the  unit for sale at a reasonable price with a realty agency or advertise it for sale at a reasonable price by listing it on the real estate multiple listing service; or

        ii. Within 90 days after the date the tenant vacated or the date the property was listed for sale, whichever is later, the owner withdraws the  unit from the market, the landlord rents the unit to someone other than the former tenant, or the landlord otherwise indicates that the owner does not intend to sell the unit;

    f. The tenant continues in possession of the premises after the landlord serves the tenant with advance written notice pursuant to RCW 59.18.200(2)(c);

    g. The tenant continues in possession after the owner elects to withdraw the premises to pursue a conversion pursuant to RCW 64.34.440 or 64.90.655;

    h. The tenant continues in possession, after the landlord has provided at least 30 days' advance written notice to vacate that: (i) The premises has been certified or condemned as uninhabitable by a local agency charged with the authority to issue such an order; and (ii) continued habitation of the premises would subject the landlord to civil or criminal penalties. However, if the terms of the local agency's order do not allow the landlord to provide at least 30 days' advance written notice, the landlord must provide as much advance written notice as is possible and still comply with the order;

        i. The tenant continues in possession after an owner or lessor, with whom the tenant shares the dwelling unit or access to a common kitchen or bathroom area, has served at least 20 days' advance written notice to vacate prior to the end of the rental term or, if a periodic tenancy, the end of the rental period;

    j. The tenant continues in possession of a dwelling unit in transitional housing after having received at least 30 days' advance written notice to vacate . Nothing in this subsection (2)(j) prohibits the ending of a tenancy in transitional housing for any of the other causes specified in this chapter;

    k. The tenant continues in possession of a dwelling unit after the expiration of a rental agreement without signing a proposed new rental agreement proffered by the landlord; provided, that the landlord proffered the proposed new rental agreement at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the current rental agreement and that any new terms and conditions of the proposed new rental agreement are reasonable. This subsection (2)(k) does not apply to tenants whose tenancies are or have become periodic;

    l. The tenant continues in possession after having received at least 30 days' advance written notice to vacate due to a material misrepresentation or omission made on the tenant's application at the inception of the tenancy that, had the misrepresentation or omission not been made, would have resulted in the landlord requesting additional information or taking an adverse action;

    m. The tenant continues in possession after having received at least 60 days' advance written notice to vacate for other good cause prior to the end of the period or rental agreement and such cause constitutes a legitimate economic or business reason not covered by another basis for ending the lease  enumerated in this chapter;

    n. [Empty]

        i. The tenant continues in possession after having received at least 60 days' written notice to vacate prior to the end of the period or rental agreement , the tenant has committed four or more of the following violations within the preceding 12-month period,  and the landlord  provided the tenant with a written warning notice at the time of each violation: A substantial breach of a material program requirement of subsidized housing, a substantial breach of a material term subscribed to by the tenant within the lease or rental agreement, a substantial or repeated and unreasonable interference with the health, safety, and welfare of, or use and enjoyment of the premises by, the landlord or neighbors of the tenant, or a substantial breach of a tenant obligation imposed by law;

        ii. Each written warning notice must

state that the landlord may choose to end the tenancy at the end of the rental term if there are four violations within a 12-month period preceding the end of the term, and state that correcting the fourth or subsequent violation is not a defense to the ending of the lease under this subsection

. This subsection (2)(n) does not absolve a landlord from demonstrating by admissible evidence that the four or more violations constituted breaches under (b) of this subsection at the time of the violation ;

    o. The tenant continues in possession after having received at least 30 days' advance written notice to vacate prior to the end of the rental period or rental agreement if the tenant is required to register as a sex offender during the tenancy, or failed to disclose a requirement to register as a sex offender when required in the rental application or otherwise known to the property owner at the beginning of the tenancy;

    p. The tenant continues in possession after having received at least 20 days' advance written notice to vacate prior to the end of the rental period or rental agreement if the tenant has made unwanted sexual advances or other acts of sexual harassment directed at the property owner, property manager, property employee,  another tenant , or any other person on or near the property;

    q. The tenant, occupant, or guest of the tenant or occupant engages in drug-related activity on or near the premises as described in RCW 59.18.130(6), 59.12.030(5), or 59.20.140(5);

    r. The tenant, occupant, or guest of the tenant or occupant engages in criminal activity on or near the premises as described in RCW 59.18.130(8) and the activity results in the arrest of the tenant, occupant, or guest of the tenant or occupant;

    s. The tenant, occupant, or guest of the tenant or occupant engages in gang-related activity on or near the premises as described in RCW 59.18.130(9) and the activity results in the arrest of the tenant, occupant, or guest of the tenant or occupant.

3.

Nothing in subsection (2)(d), (e), or (f) of this section permits a landlord to end a tenancy for a specified period before the completion of the term unless the landlord and the tenant mutually consent, in writing, to ending the tenancy early and the tenant is afforded at least 60 days to vacate.

The tenant continues in possession in person or by subtenant after a default in the payment of rent, and after written notice requiring, in the alternative, the payment of the rent or the surrender of the detained premises has remained uncomplied with for the period set forth in RCW 59.12.030(3) for tenants subject to this chapter. The written notice may be served at any time after the rent becomes due;

    b. The tenant continues in possession after substantial breach of a material program requirement of subsidized housing, material term subscribed to by the tenant within the lease or rental agreement, or a tenant obligation imposed by law, other than one for monetary damages, and after the landlord has served written notice specifying the acts or omissions constituting the breach and requiring, in the alternative, that the breach be remedied or the rental agreement will end, and the breach has not been adequately remedied by the date specified in the notice, which date must be at least 10 days after service of the notice;

    c. The tenant continues in possession after having received at least three days' advance written notice to quit after he or she commits or permits waste or nuisance upon the premises, unlawful activity that affects the use and enjoyment of the premises, or other substantial or repeated and unreasonable interference with the health, safety, and welfare of, or use and enjoyment of the premises by, the landlord or neighbors of the tenant;

    d. The tenant continues in possession after the landlord of a dwelling unit in good faith seeks possession so that the owner or his or her immediate family may occupy the unit as that person's principal residence and no substantially equivalent unit is vacant and available to house the owner or his or her immediate family in the same building, and the owner has provided at least 90 days' advance written notice of the date the tenant's possession is to end. There is a rebuttable presumption that the owner did not act in good faith if the owner or immediate family fails to occupy the unit as a principal residence for at least 60 consecutive days during the 90 days immediately after the tenant vacated the unit pursuant to a notice to vacate using this subsection (2)(d) as the cause for the lease ending;

    e. The tenant continues in possession after the owner elects to sell a single dwelling unit, which includes but is not limited to a single-family residence, a condominium unit, a townhouse unit, or any other similar type of dwelling unit, and the landlord has provided at least 90 days' advance written notice of the date the tenant's possession is to end. For the purposes of this subsection (2)(e), an owner "elects to sell" when the owner makes reasonable attempts to sell the unit within 30 days after the tenant has vacated, including, at a minimum, listing it for sale at a reasonable price with a realty agency or advertising it for sale at a reasonable price by listing it on the real estate multiple listing service. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the owner did not intend to sell the unit if:

        i. Within 30 days after the tenant has vacated, the owner does not list the  unit for sale at a reasonable price with a realty agency or advertise it for sale at a reasonable price by listing it on the real estate multiple listing service; or

        ii. Within 90 days after the date the tenant vacated or the date the property was listed for sale, whichever is later, the owner withdraws the  unit from the market, the landlord rents the unit to someone other than the former tenant, or the landlord otherwise indicates that the owner does not intend to sell the unit;

    f. The tenant continues in possession of the premises after the landlord serves the tenant with advance written notice pursuant to RCW 59.18.200(2)(c);

    g. The tenant continues in possession after the owner elects to withdraw the premises to pursue a conversion pursuant to RCW 64.90.655;

    h. The tenant continues in possession, after the landlord has provided at least 30 days' advance written notice to vacate that: (i) The premises has been certified or condemned as uninhabitable by a local agency charged with the authority to issue such an order; and (ii) continued habitation of the premises would subject the landlord to civil or criminal penalties. However, if the terms of the local agency's order do not allow the landlord to provide at least 30 days' advance written notice, the landlord must provide as much advance written notice as is possible and still comply with the order;

        i. The tenant continues in possession after an owner or lessor, with whom the tenant shares the dwelling unit or access to a common kitchen or bathroom area, has served at least 20 days' advance written notice to vacate prior to the end of the rental term or, if a periodic tenancy, the end of the rental period;

    j. The tenant continues in possession of a dwelling unit in transitional housing after having received at least 30 days' advance written notice to vacate . Nothing in this subsection (2)(j) prohibits the ending of a tenancy in transitional housing for any of the other causes specified in this chapter;

    k. The tenant continues in possession of a dwelling unit after the expiration of a rental agreement without signing a proposed new rental agreement proffered by the landlord; provided, that the landlord proffered the proposed new rental agreement at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the current rental agreement and that any new terms and conditions of the proposed new rental agreement are reasonable. This subsection (2)(k) does not apply to tenants whose tenancies are or have become periodic;

    l. The tenant continues in possession after having received at least 30 days' advance written notice to vacate due to a material misrepresentation or omission made on the tenant's application at the inception of the tenancy that, had the misrepresentation or omission not been made, would have resulted in the landlord requesting additional information or taking an adverse action;

    m. The tenant continues in possession after having received at least 60 days' advance written notice to vacate for other good cause prior to the end of the period or rental agreement and such cause constitutes a legitimate economic or business reason not covered by another a basis for ending the lease  enumerated in this chapter;

    n. [Empty]

        i. The tenant continues in possession after having received at least 60 days' written notice to vacate prior to the end of the period or rental agreement , the tenant has committed four or more of the following violations within the preceding 12-month period,  and the landlord  provided the tenant with a written warning notice at the time of each violation: A substantial breach of a material program requirement of subsidized housing, a substantial breach of a material term subscribed to by the tenant within the lease or rental agreement, a substantial or repeated and unreasonable interference with the health, safety, and welfare of, or use and enjoyment of the premises by, the landlord or neighbors of the tenant, or a substantial breach of a tenant obligation imposed by law;

        ii. Each written warning notice must

state that the landlord may choose to end the tenancy at the end of the rental term if there are four violations within a 12-month period preceding the end of the term, and state that correcting the fourth or subsequent violation is not a defense to the ending of the lease under this subsection

. This subsection (2)(n) does not absolve a landlord from demonstrating by admissible evidence that the four or more violations constituted breaches under (b) of this subsection at the time of the violation ;

    o. The tenant continues in possession after having received at least 30 days' advance written notice to vacate prior to the end of the rental period or rental agreement if the tenant is required to register as a sex offender during the tenancy, or failed to disclose a requirement to register as a sex offender when required in the rental application or otherwise known to the property owner at the beginning of the tenancy;

    p. The tenant continues in possession after having received at least 20 days' advance written notice to vacate prior to the end of the rental period or rental agreement if the tenant has made unwanted sexual advances or other acts of sexual harassment directed at the property owner, property manager, property employee,  another tenant , or any other person on or near the property;

    q. The tenant, occupant, or guest of the tenant or occupant engages in drug-related activity on or near the premises as described in RCW 59.18.130(6), 59.12.030(5), or 59.20.140(5);

    r. The tenant, occupant, or guest of the tenant or occupant engages in criminal activity on or near the premises as described in RCW 59.18.130(8) and the activity results in the arrest of the tenant, occupant, or guest of the tenant or occupant;

    s. The tenant, occupant, or guest of the tenant or occupant engages in gang-related activity on or near the premises as described in RCW 59.18.130(9) and the activity results in the arrest of the tenant, occupant, or guest of the tenant or occupant.

3.

Nothing in subsection (2)(d), (e), or (f) of this section permits a landlord to end a tenancy for a specified period before the completion of the term unless the landlord and the tenant mutually consent, in writing, to ending the tenancy early and the tenant is afforded at least 60 days to vacate.
