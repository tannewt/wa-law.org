2. A meter-mounted device must be installed in accordance with the national electrical code by a licensed electrical contractor and the installation must be approved by the local permitting authority. After a retail electric customer has identified a licensed electrical contractor to install a meter-mounted device, the retail electric customer must work with the servicing electric utility to schedule a mutually agreeable time for an electric utility representative to remove and then reconnect the utility's meter to allow for the licensed electrical contractor to install the customer's meter-mounted device.

3. An installed meter-mounted device must:

    a. Be qualified to be connected to the supply side of the service disconnect pursuant to the applicable provisions of the national electric code;

    b. Be approved or listed by a nationally recognized testing laboratory and is suitable, according to the device's approval or listing documentation, for use in meter sockets that are rated up to 200 amperes;

    c. Be certified to meet all applicable standards, as determined by a nationally recognized testing laboratory;

    d. Not impede access to the sealed meter socket compartment or the pull section of the service section of the electric meter or switchboard, as applicable; and

4. An electric utility must approve or disapprove a request from a manufacturer for approval of a specific model of meter-mounted device for installation in its service area no later than 90 days after the electric utility receives a request for approval, which must include the specific model of the meter-mounted device. An electric utility must provide public notice of all decisions approving a model of meter-mounted device, including by posting the information on the utility's website.

5. An electric utility may recover the cost of service work on any customer-owned meter-mounted device, or maintenance or repair work on any electric utility-owned equipment necessary due to the installation of a customer-owned meter-mounted device, by charging the customer directly.

6. Each electric utility must implement the provisions of this section no later than six months after the effective date of this section.

7. An electric utility may not be held liable for damage, attributable to a customer-owned meter-mounted device installed pursuant to this section, to any person or property.
