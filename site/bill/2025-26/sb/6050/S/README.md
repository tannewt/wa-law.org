# SB 6050 - Distributed energy resources

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6050-S.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that electricity is an essential resource, the rising cost of electricity is a barrier to basic necessities, interconnection fees and processes can add substantial costs and time to the adoption of solar energy systems, and upgrading electrical panels can be cost-prohibitive for some customers seeking to embrace additional electrification in their homes.

The legislature also finds that grid reliability and safety is of the utmost importance. The legislature recognizes that underwriters laboratories launched UL 3700, the testing and certification program for safer plug-in solar systems, in January 2026, and the existing UL 1741 and IEEE 1547 further provide safeguards for these systems. The IEEE 1547 standards provide uniform requirements for the safe interconnection of distributed energy resources to the grid, and specifically to the part of the grid that delivers power to homes and other buildings. UL 1741 specifies the testing methods to ensure safety for inverters and other utility interconnected distributed generation equipment to enable smarter, safer, and reactive grid interconnection. Together, these standards ensure that, if the grid goes down, a customer's solar system will also shut down, ensuring the customer's electricity lines are deenergized. Furthermore, the legislature intends to ensure that portable solar generation devices meet the national electrical code standards, and that any such device that is coupled with storage also complies with UL 3141.

Regarding meter-mounted devices, the legislature finds that these devices can provide a safe and cost-effective option for enabling electric vehicle charging, solar generation, emergency generation, and more, without an expensive electrical panel upgrade.

Therefore, the legislature intends to reduce barriers to small-scale solar systems and home electricity upgrades, and to further promote distributed energy resources.

Electrical and natural gas companies maintain programs offering incentives for single-family and multifamily housing owners to have conservation and energy efficiency measures financed and installed at their premises. The owners of single-family and multifamily rental housing may be reluctant to participate in such programs when they are required to financially supplement the company's incentive to fully fund cost-effective conservation and energy efficiency measures. By not participating in an electrical or natural gas company's programs, single-family and multifamily rental housing owners expose tenants to higher energy bills and deny electrical and natural gas companies from being able to achieve greater reductions in energy consumption.

Therefore, the legislature intends to incentivize and enable electrical and natural gas companies to access conservation and energy efficiency opportunities in single-family and multifamily rental housing in a manner that reduces the energy burden of customers, especially low-income customers, vulnerable populations, and customers in highly impacted communities; benefit the premises owner by enhancing the value of their property; and treat capital investments in conservation and energy efficiency comparably to capital investment in generation resources.
