# SB 5023 - Domestic workers

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5023-S.E.pdf)

## Section 1
Whereas domestic workers were historically excluded from many basic labor protections and whereas these protections have been identified as a priority to the people of the state of Washington, this act declares that health, safety, wage protections, and general welfare are guaranteed for domestic workers. This includes meal and rest breaks, clarity on what constitutes working time, sick time to care for themselves and their families, and the freedom from discrimination and sexual harassment.

## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Casual labor" means work that is irregular, uncertain, and incidental in nature and duration and is different in nature from the type of paid work in which the worker is customarily engaged in.

2. A hiring entity employing a domestic worker shall pay the domestic worker an overtime wage at a rate of one and one-half times the worker's regular rate for hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a workweek as provided by RCW 49.46.130.

    d. A hiring entity may not discourage meal and rest periods and cannot request that a domestic worker voluntarily waive meal and rest periods requirements.

        i. Provided in a language or languages understood by both the worker and hiring entity; and

        ii. Signed and dated by both the hiring entity and the domestic worker, after any time requested for review by either party has passed.

    b. No provisions in the written agreement may waive a domestic worker's rights under federal, state, or local law.

    c. The agreements may not contain mandatory predispute arbitration clauses for employee claims of their legal rights, noncompete agreements, nondisclosure agreements, or nondisparagement agreements that inhibit a domestic worker's claims of their legal rights under this chapter, or noncompete agreements that limit the ability of domestic workers to seek any other form of domestic work postemployment.

8. Any time a hiring entity initiates a written agreement of employment, a disclosure of rights specified in section 16 of this act must accompany that agreement.

9. The hiring entity shall provide a minimum two-week written notification period before termination of the employment. For live-in domestic workers, a minimum four-week written notification period before termination of the employment relationship shall be provided.

    a. No notification period is required if:

        i. It is in connection with termination of work performed on a casual labor basis for a hiring entity;

        ii. It occurs during an agreed-upon probationary period.

    b. Notice of termination requirements do not apply if:

        i. The hiring entity terminates employment based on a good faith belief that the domestic worker has engaged in misconduct as defined in RCW 50.04.294 or if circumstances outside of the hiring entity or the hiring entity's control apply. This includes death, or if both the hiring entity and domestic worker agree that the care needs have significantly changed and cannot be addressed by the current employment relationship. If an investigation into termination commences, the hiring entity must be able to articulate and support the allegations of misconduct or change of circumstances;

        ii. If the domestic worker becomes unable to meet the stated requirements for compensation as outlined in the written agreement.

    c. Failure to provide notification as required under this subsection shall entitle the domestic worker to severance pay in the amount of the worker's standard rate of pay multiplied by the regular number of hours worked over the period of time during which the required notification was not provided.

10. A hiring entity shall create and maintain records documenting hours worked, pay rate, meal and rest periods, the existence of a written agreement, and, where applicable, the leave time earned and used. If a complaint is filed and an investigation commences, the hiring entity must make these records accessible.

11. The enforcement entity shall maintain the confidentiality of all records it obtains in connection with enforcement activities to the full extent permitted by law.

12. Any wages due to domestic workers under this chapter are subject to the provisions of RCW 49.52.050 and RCW 49.52.070, where hiring entities are subject to the same obligations and remedies as "employers" under those sections.

## Section 4
A hiring entity that employs a domestic worker may not:

1. Request that the domestic worker allow the hiring entity, on either a mandatory or voluntary basis, to have possession of any personal effects, including any legal documents, including forms of identification, passports, or other immigration documents;

2. Engage in any form of discrimination and harassment, including as provided in chapter 49.60 RCW. A domestic worker who brings suit alleging discrimination in violation of RCW 49.60.180 shall be entitled to all substantive rights available under chapter 49.60 RCW;

6.

7. Take any adverse action against a domestic worker because the domestic worker has exercised their rights provided under this chapter. Such rights include, but are not limited to: Filing an action, organizing or communicating amongst themselves, participating in political speech, disclosing their immigration status, or instituting or causing to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this chapter.

## Section 5
Where more than one hiring entity has an employment relationship with a domestic worker in connection with  work at the same location, the hiring entities are subject to liability as well as concurrent fines and penalties for violations of this chapter. Any state agency that does not contract with or employ domestic workers in the ordinary course of business shall not be subject to liability unless that state agency directly interferes with the rights established for domestic workers under this act.

## Section 6
1. If a domestic worker files a complaint with the department alleging a violation of the domestic worker's rights under section 3 or 4 (1) or (3) through (7) of this act, the department may investigate the complaint under this section.

    a. The department may not investigate any such alleged violation of rights that occurred more than three years before the date that the domestic worker filed the complaint.

    b. If a domestic worker files a timely complaint with the department, the department may investigate the complaint and issue either a citation assessing a civil penalty or a closure letter within 60 days after the date on which the department received the complaint, unless the complaint is otherwise resolved. The department may extend the period by providing advance written notice to the domestic worker and the hiring entity setting forth good cause for an extension of the period and specifying the duration of the extension.

    c. If the department investigates a violation under this section, the department may send notice of a citation assessing a civil penalty or the closure letter to both the hiring entity and the domestic worker by service of process or using a method by which the mailing can be tracked or the delivery can be confirmed to their last known addresses.

2. Unless otherwise resolved, if the department's investigation finds that the domestic worker's allegation cannot be substantiated, the department will issue a closure letter to the domestic worker and the hiring entity detailing such finding.

3. If the department determines that the violation of rights under this chapter was a willful violation, the department may order the hiring entity to pay the department a civil penalty as specified in (a) of this subsection.

    a. A citation assessing a civil penalty for a willful violation of such rights will be $1,000 for each willful violation. For a repeat willful violator, the citation assessing a civil penalty will not be less than $2,000 for each repeat willful violation, but no greater than $20,000 for each repeat willful violation.

    b. The department may not issue a citation assessing a civil penalty if the hiring entity reasonably relied on:

        i. A written order, ruling, approval, opinion, advice, determination, or interpretation of the director; or

        ii. An interpretive or administrative policy issued by the department and filed with the office of the code reviser. In accordance with the department's retention schedule obligations under chapter 40.14 RCW, the department will maintain a complete and accurate record of all written orders, rulings, approvals, opinions, advice, determinations, and interpretations for purposes of determining whether a hiring entity is immune from civil penalties under this subsection (3)(b).

    b. "Willful" means a knowing and intentional action that is neither accidental nor the result of a bona fide dispute.

## Section 7
1. A person, firm, or corporation aggrieved by a citation assessing a civil penalty issued by the department under section 6 of this act may appeal the citation to the director by filing a notice of appeal with the director within 30 days of the department's issuance of the citation. A citation not appealed within 30 days is final and binding, and not subject to further appeal.

2. A notice of appeal filed with the director under this section will stay the effectiveness of the citation pending final review of the appeal by the director as provided for in chapter 34.05 RCW.

3. Upon receipt of a notice of appeal, the director will assign the hearing to an administrative law judge of the office of administrative hearings to conduct the hearing and issue an initial order. The hearing and review procedures will be conducted in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW, and the standard of review by the administrative law judge of an appealed citation will be de novo.

The director will conduct the administrative review in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW.

4. The director will issue all final orders after appeal of the initial order. The final order of the director is subject to judicial review in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW.

6. A hiring entity who fails to allow adequate inspection of records in an investigation by the department within a reasonable time period may not use such records in any appeal under this section to challenge the correctness of any determination by the department of penalties assessed.

## Section 8
Collections of unpaid citations administered under sections 6, 7, 10 through 12, and 18 of this act will be handled pursuant to the procedures outlined in RCW 49.48.086.

## Section 9
1. It is unlawful for a hiring entity to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of any right provided under or in connection with this chapter. This means a hiring entity may not use a domestic worker's exercise of any of the rights provided in this chapter as a negative factor in any employment action such as evaluation, promotion, or termination, or otherwise subject a domestic worker to discipline for the exercise of any rights provided under this chapter.

2. No hiring entity or any other person shall communicate to a person exercising rights protected under this chapter, directly or indirectly, the willingness or intent to inform a government employee or contracted organization suspected citizenship or immigration status of a domestic worker or a family member to a federal, state, or local agency because the domestic worker has exercised a right under this chapter.

3. It is unlawful for a hiring entity to take any adverse action against a domestic worker because the domestic worker has exercised their rights provided under this chapter. Such rights include, but are not limited to: Disclosing their immigration status or instituting or causing to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this chapter.

4. Adverse action means any action taken or threatened by a hiring entity against a domestic worker for their exercise of rights under this chapter, which may include, but is not limited to:

    a. Denying the use of any rights provided under this chapter;

    b. Denying or delaying payment due under this chapter;

    c. Terminating, suspending, demoting, or denying a promotion;

    d. Reducing the number of work hours for which the domestic worker is scheduled;

    e. Altering the domestic worker's preexisting work schedule;

    f. Reducing the domestic worker's rate of pay; and

    g. Threatening to take, or taking action, based upon the immigration status of a domestic worker or a domestic worker's family member.

5. It shall be considered a rebuttable presumption of retaliation if the hiring entity or any other person takes an adverse action against a domestic worker within 90 calendar days of the domestic worker's exercise of rights protected under this chapter. However, in the case of seasonal employment that ended before the close of the 90 calendar day period, the presumption also applies if the hiring entity fails to rehire a former domestic worker at the next opportunity for work in the same position. The hiring entity may rebut the presumption with clear and convincing evidence that the adverse action was taken for a permissible purpose.

## Section 10
1. A domestic worker who believes that they were subject to retaliation by their hiring entity, as defined in this chapter, except for section 4(2) of this act, for the exercise of any domestic worker right under this chapter, may file a complaint with the department within 180 days of the alleged retaliatory action. The department may, at its discretion, extend the 180 day period on recognized equitable principles or because extenuating circumstances exist. For example, the department may extend the 180 day period when there is evidence that the hiring entity has concealed or misled the domestic worker regarding the alleged retaliatory action.

2. If a domestic worker files a timely complaint with the department alleging retaliation, the department may investigate the complaint and issue either a citation and notice of assessment or a determination of compliance within 90 days after the date on which the department received the complaint, unless the complaint is otherwise resolved. The department may extend the period by providing advance written notice to the domestic worker and the hiring entity setting forth good cause for an extension of the period and specifying the duration of the extension.

3. The department may consider a complaint to be otherwise resolved when the domestic worker and the hiring entity reach a mutual agreement to remedy any retaliatory action, or the domestic worker voluntarily and on the domestic worker's own initiative withdraws the complaint. Mutual agreements include, but are not limited to, rehiring, reinstatement, back pay, and reestablishment of benefits.

4. If the department's investigation finds that the domestic worker's allegation of retaliation cannot be substantiated, the department may issue a determination of compliance to the domestic worker and the hiring entity detailing such finding.

5. If the department's investigation finds that the hiring entity retaliated against the domestic worker, and the complaint is not otherwise resolved, the department may, at its discretion, notify the hiring entity that the department intends to issue a citation and notice of assessment, and may provide up to 30 days after the date of such notification for the hiring entity to take corrective action to remedy the retaliatory action. If the complaint is not otherwise resolved, then the department may issue a citation and notice of assessment. The department's citation and notice of assessment may:

    a. Order the hiring entity to make payable to the domestic worker earnings that the domestic worker did not receive due to the hiring entity's retaliatory action, including interest of one percent per month on all earnings owed. The earnings and interest owed will be calculated from the first date earnings were owed to the domestic worker;

    b. Order the hiring entity to restore the domestic worker to the position of employment held by the domestic worker when the retaliation occurred, or restore the domestic worker to an equivalent position with equivalent employment hours, work schedule, benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment;

    c. For the first violation, order the hiring entity to pay the department a civil penalty as specified in this chapter; and

    d. For a repeat violation, order the hiring entity to pay the department up to double the civil penalty as specified in this chapter.

6. If the department issues a citation and notice of assessment or determination of compliance, the department will send the citation and notice of assessment or determination of compliance to both the hiring entity and domestic worker by service of process or using a method by which the mailing can be tracked or the delivery can be confirmed to their last known addresses.

7. During an investigation of the domestic worker's retaliation complaint, if the department discovers information suggesting alleged violations by the hiring entity of the domestic worker's other rights under this chapter, and all applicable rules, the department may investigate and take appropriate enforcement action without requiring the domestic worker to file a new or separate complaint. If the department determines that the hiring entity violated additional rights of the domestic worker under this chapter, and all applicable rules, the hiring entity may be subject to additional enforcement actions for the violation of such rights. If the department discovers information alleging the hiring entity retaliated against or otherwise violated rights of other domestic workers under this chapter, and all applicable rules, the department may launch further investigation under this chapter, and all applicable rules, without requiring additional complaints to be filed.

8. The department may prioritize retaliation investigations as needed to allow for timely resolution of complaints.

9. Nothing in this chapter limits the department's ability to investigate under any other authority.

10. Nothing in this chapter limits a domestic worker's right to pursue private legal action.

## Section 11
1. If the department's investigation finds that a hiring entity retaliated against a domestic worker, pursuant to the procedures outlined in sections 9 and 10 of this act, the department may order the hiring entity to pay the department a civil penalty. A civil penalty for a hiring entity's retaliatory action will not be less than $1,000 or an amount equal to 10 percent of the total amount of unpaid earnings attributable to the retaliatory action, whichever is greater. The maximum civil penalty for a hiring entity's retaliatory action shall be $20,000 for the first violation, and $40,000 for each repeat violation.

2. The department may, at any time, waive or reduce any civil penalty assessed against a hiring entity under this section if the department determines that the hiring entity has taken corrective action to remedy the retaliatory action.

3. The department will deposit civil penalties paid under this section in the supplemental pension fund established in RCW 51.44.033.

4. Collections of amounts owed for unpaid citations and notices of assessment in this section will be handled pursuant to the procedures outlined in RCW 49.48.086.

## Section 12
1. A person, firm, or corporation aggrieved by a citation and notice of assessment or a determination of compliance may, within 30 days after the date of such decision, submit a request for reconsideration to the department setting forth the grounds for seeking such reconsideration, or submit an appeal to the director pursuant to the procedures outlined in subsection (4) of this section. If the department receives a timely request for reconsideration, the department will either accept the request or treat the request as a notice of appeal.

2. If a request for reconsideration is accepted, the department will send notice of the request for reconsideration to the hiring entity and the domestic worker. The department will determine if there are any valid reasons to reverse or modify the department's original decision to issue a citation and notice of assessment or determination of compliance within 30 days of receipt of such request. The department may extend this period by providing advance written notice to the domestic worker and hiring entity setting forth good cause for an extension of the period and specifying the duration of the extension. After reviewing the reconsideration, the department will either:

    a. Notify the domestic worker and the hiring entity that the citation and notice of assessment or determination of compliance is affirmed; or

    b. Notify the domestic worker and the hiring entity that the citation and notice of assessment or determination of compliance has been reversed or modified.

3. A request for reconsideration submitted to the department shall stay the effectiveness of the citation and notice of assessment or the determination of compliance pending the reconsideration decision by the department.

4. Within 30 days after the date the department issues a citation and notice of assessment or a determination of compliance, or within 30 days after the date the department issues its decision on the request for reconsideration, a person, firm, or corporation aggrieved by a citation and notice of assessment or a determination of compliance may file with the director a notice of appeal.

5. A notice of appeal filed with the director under this section shall stay the effectiveness of the citation and notice of assessment or the determination of compliance pending final review of the appeal by the director as provided for in chapter 34.05 RCW.

6. Upon receipt of a notice of appeal, the director shall assign the hearing to an administrative law judge of the office of administrative hearings to conduct the hearing and issue an initial order. The hearing and review procedures shall be conducted in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW, and the standard of review by the administrative law judge of an appealed citation and notice of assessment or determination of compliance shall be de novo. Any party who seeks to challenge an initial order shall file a petition for administrative review with the director within 30 days after service of the initial order. The director shall conduct administrative review in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW.

7. If a request for reconsideration is not submitted to the department within 30 days after the date of the original citation and notice of assessment or determination of compliance, and a person, firm, or corporation aggrieved by a citation and notice of assessment or determination of compliance did not submit an appeal to the director, then the citation and notice of assessment or determination of compliance is final and binding, and not subject to further appeal.

8. The director shall issue all final orders after appeal of the initial order. The final order of the director is subject to judicial review in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW.

9. Director's orders that are not appealed within the time period specified in this section and chapter 34.05 RCW are final and binding, and not subject to further appeal.

10. A hiring entity who fails to allow adequate inspection of records in an investigation by the department within a reasonable time period may not use such records in any appeal to challenge the correctness of any determination by the department.

2. Any agreement between such domestic worker and the hiring entity allowing the domestic worker to receive less than what is due under this chapter shall be no defense to such action.

## Section 18
