<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>Whereas domestic workers were historically excluded from many basic labor protections and whereas these protections have been identified as a priority to the people of the state of Washington, this act declares that health, safety, wage protections, and general welfare are guaranteed for domestic workers. This includes meal and rest breaks, clarity on what constitutes working time, sick time to care for themselves and their families, and the freedom from discrimination and sexual harassment.</p>

<li>
<p>Any time a hiring entity initiates a written agreement of employment, a disclosure of rights specified in section 16 of this act must accompany that agreement.</p>

<p>If the domestic worker becomes unable to meet the stated requirements for compensation as outlined in the written agreement.</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A hiring entity shall create and maintain records documenting hours worked, pay rate, meal and rest periods, the existence of a written agreement, and, where applicable, the leave time earned and used.

<ol>
<li>
<p>It is unlawful for a hiring entity to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of any right provided under or in connection with this chapter. This means a hiring entity may not use a domestic worker's exercise of any of the rights provided in this chapter as a negative factor in any employment action such as evaluation, promotion, or termination, or otherwise subject a domestic worker to discipline for the exercise of any rights provided under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No hiring entity or any other person shall communicate to a person exercising rights protected under this chapter, directly or indirectly, the willingness or intent to inform a government employee or contracted organization suspected citizenship or immigration status of a domestic worker or a family member to a federal, state, or local agency because the domestic worker has exercised a right under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is unlawful for a hiring entity to take any adverse action against a domestic worker because the domestic worker has exercised their rights provided under this chapter. Such rights include, but are not limited to: Disclosing their immigration status or instituting or causing to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adverse action means any action taken or threatened by a hiring entity against a domestic worker for their exercise of rights under this chapter, which may include, but is not limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Denying the use of any rights provided under this chapter;</p>

<p>Threatening to take, or taking action, based upon the immigration status of a domestic worker or a domestic worker's family member.</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>It shall be considered a rebuttable presumption of retaliation if the hiring entity or any other person takes an adverse action against a domestic worker within 90 calendar days of the domestic worker's exercise of rights protected under this chapter. However, in the case of seasonal employment that ended before the close of the 90 calendar day period, the presumption also applies if the hiring entity fails to rehire a former domestic worker at the next opportunity for work in the same position. The hiring entity may rebut the presumption with clear and convincing evidence that the adverse action was taken for a permissible purpose.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-10">Section 10 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-10">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A domestic worker who believes that they were subject to retaliation by their hiring entity, as defined in this chapter, except for section 4(2) of this act, for the exercise of any domestic worker right under this chapter, may file a complaint with the department within 180 days of the alleged retaliatory action. The department may, at its discretion, extend the 180 day period on recognized equitable principles or because extenuating circumstances exist. For example, the department may extend the 180 day period when there is evidence that the hiring entity has concealed or misled the domestic worker regarding the alleged retaliatory action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a domestic worker files a timely complaint with the department alleging retaliation, the department may investigate the complaint and issue either a citation and notice of assessment or a determination of compliance within 90 days after the date on which the department received the complaint, unless the complaint is otherwise resolved. The department may extend the period by providing advance written notice to the domestic worker and the hiring entity setting forth good cause for an extension of the period and specifying the duration of the extension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may consider a complaint to be otherwise resolved when the domestic worker and the hiring entity reach a mutual agreement to remedy any retaliatory action, or the domestic worker voluntarily and on the domestic worker's own initiative withdraws the complaint. Mutual agreements include, but are not limited to, rehiring, reinstatement, back pay, and reestablishment of benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the department's investigation finds that the domestic worker's allegation of retaliation cannot be substantiated, the department may issue a determination of compliance to the domestic worker and the hiring entity detailing such finding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the department's investigation finds that the hiring entity retaliated against the domestic worker, and the complaint is not otherwise resolved, the department may, at its discretion, notify the hiring entity that the department intends to issue a citation and notice of assessment, and may provide up to 30 days after the date of such notification for the hiring entity to take corrective action to remedy the retaliatory action. If the complaint is not otherwise resolved, then the department may issue a citation and notice of assessment. The department's citation and notice of assessment may:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Order the hiring entity to make payable to the domestic worker earnings that the domestic worker did not receive due to the hiring entity's retaliatory action, including interest of one percent per month on all earnings owed. The earnings and interest owed will be calculated from the first date earnings were owed to the domestic worker;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Order the hiring entity to restore the domestic worker to the position of employment held by the domestic worker when the retaliation occurred, or restore the domestic worker to an equivalent position with equivalent employment hours, work schedule, benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the first violation, order the hiring entity to pay the department a civil penalty as specified in this chapter; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a repeat violation, order the hiring entity to pay the department up to double the civil penalty as specified in this chapter.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the department issues a citation and notice of assessment or determination of compliance, the department will send the citation and notice of assessment or determination of compliance to both the hiring entity and domestic worker by service of process or using a method by which the mailing can be tracked or the delivery can be confirmed to their last known addresses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During an investigation of the domestic worker's retaliation complaint, if the department discovers information suggesting alleged violations by the hiring entity of the domestic worker's other rights under this chapter, and all applicable rules, the department may investigate and take appropriate enforcement action without requiring the domestic worker to file a new or separate complaint. If the department determines that the hiring entity violated additional rights of the domestic worker under this chapter, and all applicable rules, the hiring entity may be subject to additional enforcement actions for the violation of such rights. If the department discovers information alleging the hiring entity retaliated against or otherwise violated rights of other domestic workers under this chapter, and all applicable rules, the department may launch further investigation under this chapter, and all applicable rules, without requiring additional complaints to be filed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may prioritize retaliation investigations as needed to allow for timely resolution of complaints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this chapter limits the department's ability to investigate under any other authority.</p>

<li>
<p>Nothing in this chapter limits a domestic worker's right to pursue private legal action.</p>
