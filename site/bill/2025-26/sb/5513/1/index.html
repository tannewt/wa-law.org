<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes pharmacists as highly educated health care professionals uniquely qualified to prescribe medications and devices to improve patient outcomes. Being deeply concerned about provider shortages in Washington, particularly in rural and underserved communities, the legislature seeks to expand access to care by leveraging pharmacists' expertise. It is the intent of the legislature to improve patient outcomes for behavioral and physical health by permitting pharmacists to practice at the top of their education, training, and experience.</p>
