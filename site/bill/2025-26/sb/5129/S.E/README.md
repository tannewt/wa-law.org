    a. If walls, floors, or ceilings are designated as boundaries of a unit, all lath, furring, wallboard, plasterboard, plaster, paneling, tiles, wallpaper, paint, finished flooring, and any other materials constituting any part of the finished surfaces thereof are a part of the unit, and all other portions of the walls, floors, or ceilings are a part of the common elements.

    b. If any chute, flue, duct, wire, conduit, bearing wall, bearing column, or any other fixture lies partially within and partially outside the designated boundaries of a unit, any portion thereof serving only that unit is a limited common element allocated solely to that unit, and any portion thereof serving more than one unit or any portion of the common elements is a part of the common elements.

2. Subject to subsection (1)(b) of this section, all spaces, interior partitions, and other fixtures and improvements within the boundaries of a unit are a part of the unit.

3. Any fireplaces, shutters, awnings, window boxes, doorsteps, stoops, porches, balconies, decks, patios, and all exterior doors and windows or other fixtures designed to serve a single unit, but located outside the unit's boundaries, are limited common elements allocated exclusively to that unit.

## Section 9
1. A declaration may:

    a. Delegate a power under RCW 64.90.405 from the unit owners association to a master association;

    b. Provide for exercise of the powers under RCW 64.90.405 by a master association that also serves as the unit owners association for the common interest community; and

    c. Reserve a special declarant right to make the common interest community subject to a master association.

2. All provisions of this chapter applicable to unit owners associations apply to the master association, except as modified by this section.

3. A unit owners association may delegate a power under RCW 64.90.405 to a master association without amending the declaration. The board of the unit owners association shall give notice to the unit owners of a proposed delegation and include a statement that unit owners may object in a record to the delegation not later than 30 days after delivery of the notice. The delegation becomes effective if the board does not receive a timely objection from unit owners of units to which at least 10 percent of the votes in the association are allocated. If the board receives a timely objection by at least 10 percent of the votes, the delegation becomes effective only if the unit owners vote under RCW 64.90.455 to approve the delegation by a majority vote. The delegation is not effective until the master association accepts the delegation.

4. A delegation under subsection (1)(a) of this section may be revoked only by an amendment to the declaration.

5. At a meeting of the unit owners which lists in the notice of the meeting the subject of delegation of powers from the board to a master association, the unit owners may revoke the delegation by a majority of the votes cast at the meeting. The effect of revocation on the rights and obligations of parties under a contract between a unit owners association and a master association is determined by law of this state other than this chapter.

6. Unless it is acting in the capacity of a unit owners association, a master association may exercise the powers set forth in RCW 64.90.405(1)(b) only to the extent expressly permitted in the declarations of common interest communities that are part of the master association or expressly described in the delegations of power from those common interest communities to the master association.

7. After a unit owners association delegates a power to a master association, the unit owners association, its board members, and its officers are not liable for an act or omission of the master association with respect to the delegated power.

8. The rights and responsibilities of unit owners with respect to the unit owners association set forth in RCW 64.90.410, 64.90.445, 64.90.450, 64.90.455, 64.90.465, and 64.90.505 apply in the conduct of the affairs of a master association only to persons who elect the board of a master association, whether or not those persons are otherwise unit owners within the meaning of this chapter.

9. Not later than 90 days after termination of a period of declarant control of the master association, the board of the master association must be elected in one of the following ways:

    a. The unit owners of all common interest communities subject to the master association may elect all members of the master association's board; or

    b. The unit owners in, or the board of, each common interest community subject to the master association elect one or more members of the master association's board if the instruments governing the master association apportion the seats on the board to each common interest community in a manner roughly proportional to the number of units in each common interest community.

10. A period of declarant control of the master association under subsection (9) of this section terminates not later than the earlier of:

    a. The termination under RCW 64.90.415 of all periods of declarant control of all common interest communities subject to the master association under RCW 64.90.415; or

    b. 60 days after conveyance to unit owners other than a declarant of 75 percent of the units that may be created in all common interest communities subject to the master association.

    a. A common interest community created on or after July 1, 2018; and

    b. A common interest community created before July 1, 2018, that amends its declaration to elect to be subject to this chapter.

5. Before January 1, 2028, except as otherwise provided in RCW 64.90.365, this chapter does not apply to any common interest community created within this state on or after July 1, 2018, if:

    a. That common interest community is made part of a common interest community created in this state prior to July 1, 2018, pursuant to a right expressly set forth in the declaration of the preexisting common interest community; and

    b. The declaration creating that common interest community expressly subjects that common interest community to the declaration of the preexisting common interest community pursuant to such right described in (a) of this subsection.

    b. The covenant, restriction, or rule being enforced is, or is likely to be construed as, inconsistent with law;

If the association does not provide notice to unit owners of a special meeting within 30 days after the requisite number or percentage of unit owners request the secretary to do so, the requesting members may directly provide notice to all the unit owners of the meeting. The unit owners may discuss at a special meeting a matter not described in the notice under (c) of this subsection but may not take action on the matter without the consent of all unit owners.

    c. An association must provide notice to unit owners of the time, date, and place of each annual and special unit owners meeting not less than 14 days and not more than 50 days before the meeting date. Notice may be by any means described in RCW 64.90.515. The notice of any meeting must state the time, date, and place of the meeting and the items on the agenda, including:

        i. The text of any proposed amendment to the declaration or organizational documents; and

        ii.

Any proposal to remove a board member or, if the declaration or organizational documents provide for the election of officers by the unit owners, any proposal to remove an officer.

2. The following requirements apply to meetings of the board and committees authorized to act for the board:

    a. Meetings must be open to the unit owners except during executive sessions, but the board may expel or prohibit attendance by any person who, after warning by the chair of the meeting, disrupts the meeting. The board and those committees may hold an executive session only during a regular or special meeting of the board or a committee. A final vote or action may not be taken during an executive session.

    b. An executive session may be held only to:

        i. Consult with the association's attorney concerning legal matters;

        ii. Discuss existing or potential litigation or mediation, arbitration, or administrative proceedings;

        iii. Discuss labor or personnel matters;

        iv. Discuss contracts, leases, and other commercial transactions to purchase or provide goods or services currently being negotiated, including the review of bids or proposals, if premature general knowledge of those matters would place the association at a disadvantage; or

    v. Prevent public knowledge of the matter to be discussed if the board or committee determines that public knowledge would violate the privacy of any person.

    c. For purposes of this subsection, a gathering of members of the board or committees at which the board or committee members do not conduct association business is not a meeting of the board or committee. Board members and committee members may not use incidental or social gatherings to evade the open meeting requirements of this subsection.

    d. During the period of declarant control, the board must meet at least four times a year. At least one of those meetings must be held at the common interest community or at a place convenient to the community. After the transition meeting, unless the organizational documents provide otherwise, and except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, all board meetings must be at the common interest community or at a place convenient to the common interest community .

    e. At each board meeting, the board must provide a reasonable opportunity for unit owners to comment regarding matters affecting the common interest community and the association. The board must provide at least 15 minutes at the beginning of each meeting for unit owners to comment about agenda items before the board votes. The board may place reasonable time restrictions of not less than 90 seconds per owner per unit, except that the time per owner per unit may be reduced and allocated equally if more than 10 unit owners wish to comment.

    f. Unless the meeting is included in a schedule given to the unit owners, the secretary or other officer specified in the organizational documents must provide notice of each board meeting to each board member and to the unit owners. The notice must be given at least 14 days before the meeting and must state the time, date, place, and agenda of the meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice of a meeting to address an event or condition that could not have been reasonably foreseen and for which it is impracticable to provide notice as otherwise required by this chapter must be given at least seven days before the meeting and by means of electronic communication to unit owners whose electronic address or phone number is known to the association.

    g. If any materials are distributed to the board before the meeting, the board must make copies of those materials reasonably available to the unit owners, except that the board need not make available copies of unapproved minutes or materials that are to be considered in executive session.

    h. Notwithstanding the governing documents , fewer than all board members may participate in a regular or special meeting by or conduct a meeting through the use of any means of communication by which all board members participating can hear each other during the meeting. A board member participating in a meeting by these means is deemed to be present in person at the meeting.

        i. Prior to the transition meeting, without a meeting, the board may act by unanimous consent as documented in a record by all its members. Actions taken by unanimous consent must be kept as a record of the association with the meeting minutes. After the transition meeting, the board may act by unanimous consent only to undertake ministerial actions, actions subject to ratification by the unit owners, or to implement actions previously taken at a meeting of the board.

    j. A board member who is present at a board meeting at which any action is taken is presumed to have assented to the action taken unless the board member's dissent or abstention to such action is lodged with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting before adjournment of the meeting or provided in a record to the secretary of the association immediately after adjournment of the meeting. The right to dissent or abstain does not apply to a board member who voted in favor of such action at the meeting.

    k. A board member may not vote by proxy or absentee ballot.

    l. Even if an action by the board is not in compliance with this section, it is valid unless set aside by a court. An action seeking relief for failure of the board to comply with this section may not be brought more than 90 days after the minutes of the board of the meeting at which the action was taken are approved or the record of that action is distributed to unit owners, whichever is later.

3. Notwithstanding the governing documents, any meeting may be held by telephonic, video, or other conferencing process if:

    a. The meeting notice states the conferencing process to be used and provides information explaining how to participate in the conference;

    b. The process provides all participants the opportunity to hear or perceive the discussion and to comment as provided in subsection (2)(e) of this section;

    c. Any votes of the board members are conducted by roll call or other verbal vote; and

    d. Any person entitled to participate in the meeting is given the option of participating by telephone.

4. Minutes of all unit owner meetings and board meetings, excluding executive sessions, must be maintained in a record. The decision on each matter voted upon at a board meeting or unit owner meeting must be recorded in the minutes.

    c. Whenever proposals or board members are to be voted upon at a meeting, a unit owner may vote by duly executed absentee ballot if:

        i. The name of each candidate and the text of each proposal to be voted upon are set forth in a writing accompanying or contained in the notice of meeting; and

        ii. A ballot is provided by the association for such purpose. Any ballot provided by the association for election of board members by the unit owners must designate a blank space for unit owners to cast a vote for one or more candidates.

    d. When a unit owner votes by absentee ballot under (c) of this subsection, the association must be able to verify that the ballot is cast by the unit owner having the right to do so.

    e. A unit owner may revoke a ballot cast pursuant to this section before the date and time under (b) of this subsection by which the ballot must be delivered to the association only by actual notice to the association of revocation.

5. If the governing documents require that votes on specified matters affecting the common interest community be cast by lessees rather than unit owners of leased units:

    a. This section applies to lessees as if they were unit owners;

    b. Unit owners that have leased their units to other persons may not cast votes on those specified matters; and

    c. Lessees are entitled to notice of meetings, access to records, and other rights respecting those matters as if they were unit owners.

6. Unit owners must also be given notice of all meetings at which lessees may be entitled to vote.

7. In any vote of the unit owners, votes allocated to a unit owned by the association must be cast in the same proportion as the votes cast on the matter by unit owners other than the association.

8. [Empty]

    a. Unless a different number or fraction of the votes in an association is required by this chapter or the declaration, a majority of the votes cast determines the outcome of a vote taken at a meeting or without a meeting.

    b. If a unit is owned by more than one person and:

        i. Only one owner casts a vote, that vote must be counted as casting all votes allocated to the unit by the declaration; and

        ii. More than one owner casts a vote for the unit, no vote from any owner of the unit may be counted unless the declaration provides a manner for allocating votes cast by multiple owners of a unit.

9. [Empty]

    a. Notwithstanding any other law or provision of the governing documents, the following votes of unit owners shall be conducted by secret ballot:

        i. Election of board members;

        ii. Removal of board members or, if the declaration or organizational documents provide for the election of officers by the unit owners, the removal of officers; or

        iii. Amendments to the  governing documents.

    b. At a meeting of unit owners held pursuant to this section, the secret ballots physically received by the association must be opened and counted and the results of the secret ballots received by the association by electronic means must be reviewed, announced, and recorded in the meeting minutes. A quorum is not required to be present when the secret ballots physically received by the association are opened and counted or the results of the secret ballots received by the association by electronic means are reviewed, announced, and recorded in the meeting minutes.

    c. The incumbent members of the board and each person whose name is placed on the ballot as a candidate for membership on the board may not possess, be given access to, or participate in the opening or counting of the secret ballots that the association physically receives, or the collection of data regarding the secret ballots that the association receives by electronic means, before those secret ballots have been opened and counted or reviewed, announced, and recorded in the meeting minutes, as applicable, at a meeting of the association.

## Section 18
1. The association must establish and maintain its accounts and records in a manner that will enable it to credit assessments for common expenses , including allocations to reserves, and other income to the association, and to charge expenditures, to the account of the appropriate units in accordance with the provisions of the declaration.

2. To assure that the unit owners are correctly assessed for the actual expenses of the association, the accounts of the association must be reconciled at least annually unless the board determines that a reconciliation would not result in a material savings to any unit owner. Unless provided otherwise in the declaration, any surplus funds of the association remaining after the payment of or provision for common expenses and any prepayment of reserves must be paid annually to the unit owners in proportion to their common expense liabilities or credited to them to reduce their future common expense assessments.

## Section 19
1. [Empty]

    a. Assessments for common expenses  must be made at least annually based on a budget adopted at least annually by the association in the manner provided in RCW 64.90.525.

    b. Assessments for common expenses  must commence on all units that have been created upon the conveyance of the first unit in the common interest community; however, the declarant may delay commencement of assessments for some or all common expenses , in which event the declarant must pay all of the common expenses  that have been delayed. In a common interest community in which units may be added pursuant to reserved development rights, the declarant may delay commencement of assessments for such units in the same manner.

2. The declaration may provide that, upon closing of the first conveyance of each unit to a purchaser or first occupancy of a unit, whichever occurs first, the association may assess and collect a working capital contribution for such unit. The working capital contribution may be collected prior to the commencement of common assessments under subsection (1) of this section. A working capital contribution may not be used to defray expenses that are the obligation of the declarant.

3. Except as provided otherwise in this section, all common expenses must be assessed against all the units in accordance with their common expense liabilities, subject to the right of the declarant to delay commencement of certain common expenses under subsections (1) and (2) of this section. Any past due assessment or installment of past due assessment bears interest at the rate established by the association pursuant to RCW 64.90.485.

4. The declaration may provide that any of the following common expenses of the association must be assessed against the units on some basis other than common expense liability. If and to the extent the declaration so provides, the association must assess:

    a. Expenses associated with the operation, maintenance, repair, or replacement of any specified limited common element against the units to which that limited common element is assigned, equally or in any other proportion that the declaration provides;

    b. Expenses specified in the declaration as benefiting fewer than all of the units or their unit owners exclusively against the units benefited in proportion to their common expense liability or in any other proportion that the declaration provides, but if the common expense is for the maintenance, repair, or replacement of a common element other than a limited common element, the expense may be assessed exclusively against them only if the declaration reasonably identifies the common expense by specific listing or category;

    c. The costs of insurance in proportion to risk; and

    d. The costs of one or more specified services or utilities in proportion to respective usage, whether metered, billed in bulk based on unit count, or reasonably estimated, or upon the same basis as such  charges are made by the service or utility provider.

5. Assessments to pay a judgment against the association may be made only against the units in the common interest community at the time the judgment was entered, in proportion to their common expense liabilities.

6. The association may assess exclusively against a unit owner's unit common expenses, including expenses relating to damage to or loss of property, caused by the:

    a. Willful misconduct or gross negligence of the unit owner or the unit owner's tenant, guest, invitee, or occupant;

    b. Failure of the unit owner to comply with a maintenance standard prescribed by the declaration or a rule, if the standard contains a statement that an owner may be liable for damage or loss caused by failure to comply with the standard; or

    c. Negligence of the unit owner or the unit owner's tenant, guest, invitee, or occupant, if the declaration contains a statement that an owner may be liable for damage or loss caused by such negligence.

7. Before an association makes an assessment under subsection (6) of this section, the association must give notice to the unit owner and provide an opportunity for a hearing. The assessment is limited to the expense the association incurred under subsection (6) of this section less any insured proceeds received by the association, whether the difference results from the application of a deductible or otherwise.

8. In the event of a loss or damage to a unit that would be covered by the association's property insurance policy, excluding policies for earthquake, flood, or similar losses that have higher than standard deductibles, but that is within the deductible under that policy and if the declaration so provides, the association may assess the amount of the loss up to the deductible against that unit. This subsection does not prevent a unit owner from asserting a claim against another person for the amount assessed if that other person would be liable for the damages under general legal principles.

9. If common expense liabilities are reallocated, assessments and any installment of assessments not yet due must be recalculated in accordance with the reallocated common expense liabilities.

10. An association must provide at least one method of accepting payment of assessments from unit owners at no charge or as a common expense.

## Section 20
1. The association has a statutory lien on each unit for any unpaid assessment against the unit from the time such assessment is due.

2. A lien under this section has priority over all other liens and encumbrances on a unit except:

    a. Liens and encumbrances recorded before the recordation of the declaration and, in a cooperative, liens and encumbrances that the association creates, assumes, or takes subject to;

    b. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, a security interest on the unit recorded before the date on which the unpaid assessment became due or, in a cooperative, a security interest encumbering only the unit owner's interest and perfected before the date on which the unpaid assessment became due; and

    c. Liens for real estate taxes and other state or local governmental assessments or charges against the unit or cooperative.

3. [Empty]

    a. A lien under this section also has priority over the security interests described in subsection (2)(b) of this section to the extent of an amount equal to the following:

        i. The common expense assessments, excluding any amounts for capital improvements, based on the periodic budget adopted by the association pursuant to RCW 64.90.480(1),  which would have become due in the absence of acceleration during the six months immediately preceding the institution of proceedings to foreclose either the association's lien or a security interest described in subsection (2)(b) of this section;

        ii. The association's actual costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in foreclosing its lien but incurred after the giving of the notice described in (a)(iii) of this subsection; provided, however, that the costs and reasonable attorneys' fees that will have priority under this subsection (3)(a)(ii) shall not exceed $2,000 or an amount equal to the amounts described in (a)(i) of this subsection, whichever is less;

        iii. The amounts described in (a)(ii) of this subsection shall be prior only to the security interest of the holder of a security interest on the unit recorded before the date on which the unpaid assessment became due and only if the association has given that holder not less than 60 days' prior written notice that the owner of the unit is in default in payment of an assessment. The notice shall contain:

(A) Name of the borrower;

(B) Recording date of the trust deed or mortgage;

(C) Recording information;

(D) Name of common interest community, unit owner, and unit designation stated in the declaration or applicable supplemental declaration;

(E) Amount of unpaid assessment; and

(F) A statement that failure to, within 60 days of the written notice, submit the association payment of six months of assessments as described in (a)(i) of this subsection will result in the priority of the amounts described in (a)(ii) of this subsection; and

        iv. Upon payment of the amounts described in (a)(i) and (ii) of this subsection by the holder of a security interest, the association's lien described in this subsection (3)(a) shall thereafter be fully subordinated to the lien of such holder's security interest on the unit.

    b. For the purposes of this subsection:

        i. "Institution of proceedings" means either:

(A) The date of recording of a notice of trustee's sale by a deed of trust beneficiary;

(B) The date of commencement, pursuant to applicable court rules, of an action for judicial foreclosure either by the association or by the holder of a recorded security interest; or

(C) The date of recording of a notice of intention to forfeit in a real estate contract forfeiture proceeding by the vendor under a real estate contract.

        ii. "Capital improvements" does not include making, in the ordinary course of management, repairs to common elements or replacements of the common elements with substantially similar items, subject to: (A) Availability of materials and products, (B) prevailing law, or (C) sound engineering and construction standards then prevailing.

    c. The adoption of a periodic budget that purports to allocate to a unit any fines, late charges, interest, attorneys' fees and costs incurred for services unrelated to the foreclosure of the association's lien, other collection charges, or specially allocated assessments assessed under RCW 64.90.480(6)  does not cause any such items to be included in the priority amount affecting such unit.

4. Subsections (2) and (3) of this section do not affect the priority of mechanics' or material suppliers' liens to the extent that law of this state other than chapter 277, Laws of 2018 gives priority to such liens, or the priority of liens for other assessments made by the association.

5. A lien under this section is not subject to chapter 6.13 RCW.

6. If the association forecloses its lien under this section nonjudicially pursuant to chapter 61.24 RCW, as provided under subsection (13) of this section, the association is not entitled to the lien priority provided for under subsection (3) of this section, and is subject to the limitations on deficiency judgments as provided in chapter 61.24 RCW.

7. Unless the declaration provides otherwise, if two or more associations have liens for assessments created at any time on the same property, those liens have equal priority as to each other, and any foreclosure of one such lien shall not affect the lien of the other.

8. Recording of the declaration constitutes record notice and perfection of the statutory lien created under this section. Further notice or recordation of any claim of lien for assessment under this section is not required, but is not prohibited.

9. A lien for unpaid assessments and the personal liability for payment of those assessments are extinguished unless proceedings to enforce the lien or collect the debt are instituted within six years after the full amount of the assessments sought to be recovered becomes due.

10. This section does not prohibit actions against unit owners to recover sums for which subsection (1) of this section creates a lien or prohibit an association from taking a deed in lieu of foreclosure.

11. The association upon written request must furnish to a unit owner or a mortgagee a statement signed by an officer or authorized agent of the association setting forth the amount of unpaid assessments or the priority amount against that unit, or both. The statement must be furnished within 15 days after receipt of the request and is binding on the association, the board, and every unit owner unless, and to the extent, known by the recipient to be false. The liability of a recipient who reasonably relies upon the statement must not exceed the amount set forth in any statement furnished pursuant to this section or RCW 64.90.640(1)(b).

12. In a cooperative, upon nonpayment of an assessment on a unit, the unit owner may be evicted in the same manner as provided by law in the case of an unlawful holdover by a commercial tenant, and the lien may be foreclosed as provided under this section.

13. The association's lien may be foreclosed in accordance with (a) and (b) of this subsection.

    a. In a common interest community other than a cooperative, the association's lien may be foreclosed judicially in accordance with chapter 61.12 RCW, subject to any rights of redemption under chapter 6.23 RCW.

    b. The lien may be enforced nonjudicially in the manner set forth in chapter 61.24 RCW for nonjudicial foreclosure of deeds of trust if the declaration: Contains a grant of the common interest community in trust to a trustee qualified under RCW 61.24.010 to secure the obligations of the unit owners to the association for the payment of assessments, contains a power of sale, provides in its terms that the units are not used principally for agricultural purposes, and provides that the power of sale is operative in the case of a default in the obligation to pay assessments. The association or its authorized representative may purchase the unit at the foreclosure sale and acquire, hold, lease, mortgage, or convey the unit. Upon an express waiver in the complaint of any right to a deficiency judgment in a judicial foreclosure action, the period of redemption is eight months.

    c. In a cooperative in which the unit owners' interests in the units are real estate, the association's lien must be foreclosed in like manner as a mortgage on real estate or by power of sale under (b) of this subsection.

    d. In a cooperative in which the unit owners' interests in the units are personal property, the association's lien must be foreclosed in like manner as a security interest under chapter 62A.9A RCW.

    e. No member of the association's board, or their immediate family members or affiliates, are eligible to bid for or purchase, directly or indirectly, any interest in a unit at a foreclosure of the association's lien. For the purposes of this subsection, "immediate family member" includes spouses, domestic partners, children, siblings, parents, parents-in-law, and stepfamily members; and "affiliate" of a board member includes any person controlled by the board member, including any entity in which the board member is a general partner, managing member, majority member, officer, or director. Nothing in this subsection prohibits an association from bidding for or purchasing interest in a unit at a foreclosure of the association's lien.

14. If the unit owner's interest in a unit in a cooperative is real estate, the following requirements apply:

    a. The association, upon nonpayment of assessments and compliance with this subsection, may sell that unit at a public sale or by private negotiation, and at any time and place. The association must give to the unit owner and any lessee of the unit owner reasonable notice in a record of the time, date, and place of any public sale or, if a private sale is intended, of the intention of entering into a contract to sell and of the time and date after which a private conveyance may be made. Such notice must also be sent to any other person that has a recorded interest in the unit that would be cut off by the sale, but only if the recorded interest was on record seven weeks before the date specified in the notice as the date of any public sale or seven weeks before the date specified in the notice as the date after which a private sale may be made. The notices required under this subsection may be sent to any address reasonable in the circumstances. A sale may not be held until five weeks after the sending of the notice. The association may buy at any public sale and, if the sale is conducted by a fiduciary or other person not related to the association, at a private sale.

    b. Unless otherwise agreed to or as stated in this section, the unit owner is liable for any deficiency in a foreclosure sale.

    c. The proceeds of a foreclosure sale must be applied in the following order:

        i. The reasonable expenses of sale;

        ii. The reasonable expenses of securing possession before sale; the reasonable expenses of holding, maintaining, and preparing the unit for sale, including payment of taxes and other governmental charges and premiums on insurance; and, to the extent provided for by agreement between the association and the unit owner, reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and other legal expenses incurred by the association;

        iii. Satisfaction of the association's lien;

        iv. Satisfaction in the order of priority of any subordinate claim of record; and

    v. Remittance of any excess to the unit owner.

    d. A good-faith purchaser for value acquires the unit free of the association's debt that gave rise to the lien under which the foreclosure sale occurred and any subordinate interest, even though the association or other person conducting the sale failed to comply with this section. The person conducting the sale must execute a conveyance to the purchaser sufficient to convey the unit and stating that it is executed by the person after a foreclosure of the association's lien by power of sale and that the person was empowered to make the sale. Signature and title or authority of the person signing the conveyance as grantor and a recital of the facts of nonpayment of the assessment and of the giving of the notices required under this subsection are sufficient proof of the facts recited and of the authority to sign. Further proof of authority is not required even though the association is named as grantee in the conveyance.

    e. At any time before the association has conveyed a unit in a cooperative or entered into a contract for its conveyance under the power of sale, the unit owners or the holder of any subordinate security interest may cure the unit owner's default and prevent sale or other conveyance by tendering the performance due under the security agreement, including any amounts due because of exercise of a right to accelerate, plus the reasonable expenses of proceeding to foreclosure incurred to the time of tender, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of the creditor.

15. In an action by an association to collect assessments or to foreclose a lien on a unit under this section, the court may appoint a receiver to collect all sums alleged to be due and owing to a unit owner before commencement or during pendency of the action. The receivership is governed under chapter 7.60 RCW. During pendency of the action, the court may order the receiver to pay sums held by the receiver to the association for any assessments against the unit. The exercise of rights under this subsection by the association does not affect the priority of preexisting liens on the unit.

16. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the holder of a mortgage or other purchaser of a unit who obtains the right of possession of the unit through foreclosure is not liable for assessments or installments of assessments that became due prior to such right of possession. Such unpaid assessments are deemed to be common expenses collectible from all the unit owners, including such mortgagee or other purchaser of the unit. Foreclosure of a mortgage does not relieve the prior unit owner of personal liability for assessments accruing against the unit prior to the date of such sale as provided in this subsection.

17. In addition to constituting a lien on the unit, each assessment is the joint and several obligation of the unit owner of the unit to which the same are assessed as of the time the assessment is due. A unit owner may not exempt himself or herself from liability for assessments. In a voluntary conveyance other than by foreclosure, the grantee of a unit is jointly and severally liable with the grantor for all unpaid assessments against the grantor up to the time of the grantor's conveyance, without prejudice to the grantee's right to recover from the grantor the amounts paid by the grantee. Suit to recover a personal judgment for any delinquent assessment is maintainable in any court of competent jurisdiction without foreclosing or waiving the lien securing such sums.

18. The association may from time to time establish reasonable late charges and a rate of interest to be charged, not to exceed the maximum rate calculated under RCW 19.52.020, on all subsequent delinquent assessments or installments of assessments. If the association does not establish such a rate, delinquent assessments bear interest from the date of delinquency at the maximum rate calculated under RCW 19.52.020 on the date on which the assessments became delinquent.

19. The association is entitled to recover any costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with the collection of delinquent assessments, whether or not such collection activities result in a suit being commenced or prosecuted to judgment. The prevailing party is also entitled to recover costs and reasonable attorneys' fees in such suits, including any appeals, if it prevails on appeal and in the enforcement of a judgment.

20. To the extent not inconsistent with this section, the declaration may provide for such additional remedies for collection of assessments as may be permitted by law.

21. [Empty]

    c. Mailing the first preforeclosure notice pursuant to (a) of this subsection does not satisfy the requirement in subsection (22)(b) of this section to mail a second preforeclosure notice at or after the date that assessments have become past due for at least 90 days. The second preforeclosure notice may not be mailed sooner than 60 days after the first preforeclosure notice is mailed.

22. An association may not commence an action to foreclose a lien on a unit under this section unless:

    a. The unit owner, at the time the action is commenced, owes at least a sum equal to the greater of:

        i. Three months or more of assessments, not including fines, late charges, interest, attorneys' fees, or costs incurred by the association in connection with the collection of a delinquent owner's account; or

        ii. $2,000 of assessments, not including fines, late charges, interest, attorneys' fees, or costs incurred by the association in connection with the collection of a delinquent owner's account;

    b. At or after the date that assessments have become past due for at least 90 days, but no sooner than 60 days after the first preforeclosure notice required in subsection (21)(a) of this section is mailed, the association has mailed, by first-class mail, to the owner, at the unit address and to any other address which the owner has provided to the association, a second notice of delinquency, which must include a second preforeclosure notice that contains the same information as the first preforeclosure notice provided to the owner pursuant to subsection (21)(a) of this section. The second preforeclosure notice may not be mailed sooner than 60 days after the first preforeclosure notice required in subsection (21)(a) of this section is mailed;

    c. At least 90 days have elapsed from the date the minimum amount required in (a) of this subsection has accrued; and

    d. The board approves commencement of a foreclosure action specifically against that unit.

23. Every aspect of a collection, foreclosure, sale, or other conveyance under this section, including the method, advertising, time, date, place, and terms, must be commercially reasonable.

Under RCW 64.90.635, you have the right to cancel your contract for the purchase of your unit within seven days after first receiving this public offering statement. If this public offering statement is first provided to you more than seven days before you sign your contract for the purchase of your unit, you have no right to cancel your contract. If this public offering statement is first provided to you seven days or less before you sign your contract for the purchase of your unit, you have the right to cancel, before conveyance of the unit, the executed contract by delivering, no later than the seventh day after first receiving this public offering statement, a notice of cancellation pursuant to section (3) of this notice. If this public offering statement is first provided to you less than seven days before the closing date for the conveyance of your unit, you may, before conveyance of your unit to you, extend the closing date to a date not more than seven days after you first received this public offering statement, so that you may have seven days to cancel your contract for the purchase of your unit.

2. You have no right to cancel your contract upon receipt of an amendment to this public offering statement; however, this does not eliminate any right to rescind your contract, due to the disclosure of the information in the amendment, that is otherwise available to you under generally applicable contract law.

3. If you elect to cancel your contract pursuant to this notice, you may do so by hand-delivering notice of cancellation, or by mailing notice of cancellation by prepaid United States mail, to the seller at the address set forth in this public offering statement or at the address of the seller's registered agent for service of process. The date of such notice is the date of receipt, if hand-delivered, or the date of deposit in the United States mail, if mailed. Cancellation is without penalty, and all payments made to the seller by you before cancellation must be refunded promptly."

    b. "OTHER DOCUMENTS CREATING BINDING LEGAL OBLIGATIONS. This public offering statement is a summary of some of the significant aspects of purchasing a unit in this common interest community. The governing documents and the purchase agreement are complex, contain other important information, and create binding legal obligations. You should consider seeking the assistance of legal counsel."

    c. "OTHER REPRESENTATIONS. You may not rely on any statement, promise, model, depiction, or description unless it is (1) contained in the public offering statement delivered to you or (2) made in writing signed by the declarant or dealer or the declarant's or dealer's agent identified in the public offering statement. A statement of opinion, or a commendation of the real estate, its quality, or its value, does not create a warranty, and a statement, affirmation, promise, model, depiction, or description does not create a warranty if it discloses that it is only proposed, is not representative, or is subject to change."

    d. "MODEL UNITS. Model units are intended to provide you with a general idea of what a finished unit might look like. Units being offered for sale may vary from the model unit in terms of floor plan, fixtures, finishes, and equipment. You are advised to obtain specific information about the unit you are considering purchasing."

    e. "RESERVE STUDY. The association [does] [does not] have a current reserve study. Any reserve study should be reviewed carefully. It may not include all reserve components that will require major maintenance, repair, or replacement in future years, and may not include regular contributions to a reserve account for the cost of such maintenance, repair, or replacement. You may encounter certain risks, including being required to pay as a special assessment your share of expenses for the cost of major maintenance, repair, or replacement of a reserve component, as a result of the failure to: (1) Have a current reserve study or fully funded reserves, (2) include a component in a reserve study, or (3) provide any or sufficient contributions to a reserve account for a component."

    f. "DEPOSITS AND PAYMENTS. Only earnest money and reservation deposits are required to be placed in an escrow or trust account. Any other payments you make to the seller of a unit are at risk and may be lost if the seller defaults."

    g. "CONSTRUCTION DEFECT CLAIMS. Chapter 64.50 RCW contains important requirements you must follow before you may file a lawsuit for defective construction against the seller or builder of your home. Forty-five days before you file your lawsuit, you must deliver to the seller or builder a written notice of any construction conditions you allege are defective and provide your seller or builder the opportunity to make an offer to repair or pay for the defects. You are not obligated to accept any offer made by the builder or seller. There are strict deadlines and procedures under state law, and failure to follow them may affect your ability to file a lawsuit."

    h. "ASSOCIATION INSURANCE. The extent to which association insurance provides coverage for the benefit of unit owners (including furnishings, fixtures, and equipment in a unit) is determined by the provisions of the declaration and the association's insurance policy, which may be modified from time to time. You and your personal insurance agent should read the declaration and the association's policy prior to closing to determine what insurance is required of the association and unit owners, unit owners' rights and duties, what is and is not covered by the association's policy, and what additional insurance you should obtain."

        i. "QUALIFIED WARRANTY. Your unit [is] [is not] covered by a qualified warranty under chapter 64.35 RCW."

    j. "THIS UNIT IS LOCATED WITHIN A COMMON INTEREST COMMUNITY AND IS SUBJECT TO THE DECLARATION, BYLAWS, RULES, AND OTHER WRITTEN INSTRUMENTS GRANTING AUTHORITY TO THE ASSOCIATION AS ADOPTED (THE "GOVERNING DOCUMENTS").

THE PURCHASER OF THIS UNIT WILL BE REQUIRED TO BE A MEMBER OF THE ASSOCIATION AND WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS.

THE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS WILL IMPOSE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS UPON THE OWNER OF THE UNIT, INCLUDING AN OBLIGATION TO PAY ASSESSMENTS TO THE ASSOCIATION WHICH MAY INCLUDE REGULAR AND SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS, FINES, FEES, INTEREST, LATE CHARGES, AND COSTS OF COLLECTION, INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES.

THE ASSOCIATION HAS A STATUTORY LIEN ON EACH INDIVIDUAL UNIT FOR ANY UNPAID ASSESSMENT FROM THE TIME IT IS DUE. FAILURE TO PAY ASSESSMENTS COULD RESULT IN THE FILING OF A LIEN ON THE UNIT AND LOSS OF THE UNIT THROUGH FORECLOSURE.

THE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS MAY PROHIBIT OWNERS FROM MAKING CHANGES TO THE UNIT WITHOUT REVIEW AND THE APPROVAL OF THE ASSOCIATION, AND MAY ALSO IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF THE UNIT, DISPLAY OF SIGNS, CERTAIN BEHAVIORS, AND OTHER ITEMS.

PURCHASERS OF THIS UNIT SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS OF MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION, THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ASSOCIATION'S FINANCES, THE CURRENT RESERVE STUDY, IF ANY, THE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS, AND THE OTHER INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN THE RESALE CERTIFICATE. THE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND CREATE BINDING LEGAL OBLIGATIONS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER SEEKING THE ASSISTANCE OF LEGAL COUNSEL."

3. The public offering statement must include copies of each of the following documents: The declaration; the map; the organizational documents; the rules, if any; the current or proposed budget for the association; a dated balance sheet of the association; any inspection and repair report or reports prepared in accordance with the requirements of RCW 64.55.090; and any qualified warranty provided to a purchaser by a declarant together with a history of claims under the qualified warranty. If any of these documents are not in final form, the documents must be marked "draft" and, before closing the sale of a unit, the purchaser must be given notice of any material changes to the draft documents.

4. A declarant must promptly amend the public offering statement to reflect any material change in the information required under this section.

## Section 28
1. A person required to deliver a public offering statement pursuant to RCW 64.90.605(3)(a) shall provide a purchaser with a copy of the public offering statement and all amendments thereto before conveyance of the unit. The purchaser may cancel a contract for the purchase of the unit within seven days after first receiving the public offering statement. If the public offering statement is first provided to a purchaser more than seven days before execution of a contract for the purchase of a unit, the purchaser does not have the right under this section to cancel the executed contract. If the public offering statement is first provided to a purchaser seven days or less before the purchaser signs a contract for the purchase of a unit, the purchaser, before conveyance of the unit to the purchaser, may cancel the contract by delivering, no later than the seventh day after first receiving the public offering statement, a notice of cancellation, delivered pursuant to subsection (3) of this section. If the public offering statement is first provided to a purchaser less than seven days before the closing date for the conveyance of that unit, the purchaser may, before conveyance of the unit to the purchaser, extend the closing date to a date not more than seven days after the purchaser first received the public offering statement.

2. A purchaser does not have the right under this section to cancel a contract upon receipt of an amendment to a public offering statement. This subsection does not eliminate any right that is otherwise available to the purchaser under generally applicable contract law to rescind the contract due to a material change in the information disclosed in the amendment.

3. If a purchaser elects to cancel a contract under subsection (1) of this section, the purchaser may do so by hand-delivering notice of cancellation, or by mailing notice of cancellation by prepaid United States mail, to the declarant at the address set forth in the public offering statement or at the address of the declarant's registered agent for service of process. The date of such notice is the date of receipt of delivery, if hand-delivered, or the date of deposit in the United States mail, if mailed. Cancellation is without penalty, and all payments made to the seller by the purchaser before cancellation must be refunded promptly. There is no liability for failure to deliver any amendment unless such failure would have entitled the purchaser under generally applicable legal principles to cancel the contract for the purchase of the unit had the undisclosed information been evident to the purchaser before the closing of the purchase.

4. The language of the notice required under RCW 64.90.610(2)(a) must not be construed to modify the rights set forth in this section.

## Section 29

Except in the case of a sale when delivery of a public offering statement is required, or unless exempt under RCW 64.90.600(2) or unless the buyer of a unit within a common interest community has expressly waived the right to receive a resale certificate because it is unavailable as provided in RCW 64.90.600(4), a unit owner must furnish to a purchaser before execution of any contract for sale of a unit, or otherwise before conveyance, a resale certificate, signed by an officer or authorized agent of the association and based on the books and records of the association and the actual knowledge of the person signing the certificate, containing:

    m. For notices issued after June 30, 2018, on the top of the first page of the notice:

        i. The current beneficiary of the deed of trust;

        ii. The current mortgage servicer for the deed of trust; and

        iii. The current trustee for the deed of trust;

9. That, for residential real property of up to four units, before the notice of the trustee's sale is recorded, transmitted, or served, the beneficiary has complied with RCW 61.24.031 and, if applicable, RCW 61.24.163;

10. That, in the case where the borrower or grantor is known to the mortgage servicer or trustee to be deceased, the notice required under subsection (8) of this section must be sent to any spouse, child, or parent of the borrower or grantor known to the trustee or mortgage servicer, and to any owner of record of the property, at any address provided to the trustee or mortgage servicer, and to the property addressed to the heirs and devisees of the borrower.

    a. If the name or address of any spouse, child, or parent of such deceased borrower or grantor cannot be ascertained with use of reasonable diligence, the trustee must execute and record with the notice of sale a declaration attesting to the same.

    b. Reasonable diligence for the purposes of this subsection (10) means the trustee shall search in the county where the property is located, the public records and information for any obituary, will, death certificate, or case in probate within the county for the borrower and grantor;

11. Upon written notice identifying the property address and the name of the borrower to the servicer or trustee by someone claiming to be a successor in interest to the borrower's or grantor's property rights, but who is not a party to the loan or promissory note or other obligation secured by the deed of trust, a trustee shall not record a notice of sale pursuant to RCW 61.24.040 until the trustee or mortgage servicer completes the following:

    a. Acknowledges the notice in writing and requests reasonable documentation of the death of the borrower or grantor from the claimant including, but not limited to, a death certificate or other written evidence of the death of the borrower or grantor. Other written evidence of the death of the borrower or grantor may include an obituary, a published death notice, or documentation of an open probate action for the estate of the borrower or grantor. The claimant must be allowed 30 days from the date of this request to present this documentation. If the trustee or mortgage servicer has already obtained sufficient proof of the borrower's death, it may proceed by acknowledging the claimant's notice in writing and issuing a request under (b) of this subsection.

    b. If the mortgage servicer or trustee obtains or receives written documentation of the death of the borrower or grantor from the claimant, or otherwise independently confirms the death of the borrower or grantor, then the servicer or trustee must request in writing documentation from the claimant demonstrating the ownership interest of the claimant in the real property. A claimant has 60 days from the date of the request to present this documentation. Documentation demonstrating the ownership interest of the claimant in the real property includes, but is not limited to, one of the following:

        i. Excerpts of a trust document noting the claimant as a beneficiary of a trust with title to the real property;

        ii. A will of the borrower or grantor listing the claimant as an heir or devisee with respect to the real property;

        iii. A probate order or finding of heirship issued by any court documenting the claimant as an heir or devisee or awarding the real property to the claimant;

        iv. A recorded lack of probate affidavit signed by any heir listing the claimant as an heir of the borrower or grantor pursuant to the laws of intestacy;

    v. A deed, such as a personal representative's deed, trustee's deed issued on behalf of a trust, statutory warranty deed, transfer on death deed, or other deed, giving any ownership interest to the claimant resulting from the death of the borrower or grantor or executed by the borrower or grantor for estate planning purposes; and

    vi. Other proof documenting the claimant as an heir of the borrower or grantor pursuant to state rules of intestacy set forth in chapter 11.04 RCW.

    c. If the mortgage servicer or trustee receives written documentation demonstrating the ownership interest of the claimant prior to the expiration of the 60 days provided in (b) of this subsection, then the servicer or trustee must, within 20 days of receipt of proof of ownership interest, provide the claimant with, at a minimum, the loan balance, interest rate and interest reset dates and amounts, balloon payments if any, prepayment penalties if any, the basis for the default, the monthly payment amount, reinstatement amounts or conditions, payoff amounts, and information on how and where payments should be made. The mortgage servicers shall also provide the claimant application materials and information, or a description of the process, necessary to request a loan assumption and modification.

    d. Upon receipt by the trustee or the mortgage servicer of the documentation establishing claimant's ownership interest in the real property, that claimant shall be deemed a "successor in interest" for the purposes of this section.

    e. There may be more than one successor in interest to the borrower's property rights. The trustee and mortgage servicer shall apply the provisions of this section to each successor in interest. In the case of multiple successors in interest, where one or more do not wish to assume the loan as coborrowers or coapplicants, a mortgage servicer may require any nonapplicant successor in interest to consent in writing to the application for loan assumption.

    f. The existence of a successor in interest under this section does not impose an affirmative duty on a mortgage servicer or alter any obligation the mortgage servicer has to provide a loan modification to the successor in interest. If a successor in interest assumes the loan, he or she may be required to otherwise qualify for available foreclosure prevention alternatives offered by the mortgage servicer.

    g. (c), (e), and (f) of this subsection (11) do not apply to association beneficiaries subject to chapter 64.32, 64.34,  64.38, or 64.90 RCW; and

12. Nothing in this section shall prejudice the right of the mortgage servicer or beneficiary from discontinuing any foreclosure action initiated under the deed of trust act in favor of other allowed methods for pursuit of foreclosure of the security interest or deed of trust security interest.
