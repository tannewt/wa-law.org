<p>A holder who fails to pay or deliver property when due is required to pay to the administrator interest at the rate as computed under RCW 82.32.050(1)(c) and set under RCW 82.32.050(2). However, the administrator must waive or cancel interest imposed under this subsection if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The administrator finds that the failure to pay or deliver the property within the time prescribed by this chapter was the result of circumstances beyond the holder's control sufficient for waiver or cancellation of interest under RCW 82.32.105;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The failure to timely pay or deliver the property within the time prescribed by this chapter was the direct result of written instructions given to the holder by the administrator; or</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Penalties under subsections (2) through (4) of this section may be waived or canceled only if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The administrator finds that the failure to pay or deliver within the time prescribed by this chapter was the result of circumstances beyond the holder's control sufficient for waiver or cancellation of penalties under RCW 82.32.105; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The holder requests the waiver for a report required to be filed under RCW 63.30.220 and has timely filed as provided by RCW 63.30.240 all reports due under RCW 63.30.220 and paid or delivered all property associated with those reports for a period of 24 months immediately preceding the period covered by the report for which the waiver is being requested.</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a holder willfully fails to file a report or to provide written notice to apparent owners as required under this chapter, the administrator may assess a civil penalty of $100 for each day the report is withheld or the notice is not sent, but not more than $5,000.</p>

<p>If a holder, having filed a report, failed to file the report electronically as required by RCW 63.30.220, or failed to pay electronically any amounts due under the report as required by RCW 63.30.340, the administrator must assess a penalty equal to five percent of the amount payable or deliverable under the report, unless the administrator grants the holder relief from the electronic filing and payment requirements. Total penalties assessed under this subsection may not exceed five percent of the amount payable and value of property deliverable under the report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a holder enters into a contract or other arrangement for the purpose of evading an obligation under this chapter or otherwise willfully fails to perform a duty imposed on the holder under this chapter, the administrator may require the holder to pay the administrator, in addition to interest as provided in this section, a civil penalty of $1,000 for each day the obligation is evaded or the duty not performed, up to a cumulative maximum amount of $25,000, plus 25 percent of the amount or value of property that should have been but was not reported, paid, or delivered as a result of the evasion or failure to perform.</p>

A petition for review under this section is timely if received in writing by the administrator on or before 90 days after the holder receives the determination from the administrator pursuant to RCW 63.30.680 or from any extension of the due date granted by the administrator, or in the case of a refund or return application, 30 days after the administrator rejects the application in writing, regardless of any subsequent action by the administrator to reconsider its initial decision.

<p>Any putative holder who has paid or delivered property to the administrator under the provisions of this chapter, except one who has failed to keep and preserve records as required in this chapter, feeling aggrieved by such payment or delivery, may appeal to the Thurston county superior court. The putative holder filing a notice of appeal under this section is deemed the plaintiff, and the administrator, the defendant.</p>

<p>In an appeal filed under this section, the plaintiff must set forth the amount or property, if any, payable or deliverable on the report or assessment that the plaintiff is contesting, which the holder concedes to be the correct amount payable or deliverable, and the reason why the amount payable or deliverable should be reduced or abated.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Both parties are entitled to subpoena the attendance of witnesses as in other civil actions and to produce evidence that is competent, relevant, and material to determine the correct amount due, if any, that should be paid by the plaintiff.</p>
