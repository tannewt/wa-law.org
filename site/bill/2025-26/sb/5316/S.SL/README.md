1. [Empty]

    a. Except as otherwise provided in this section, on filing a report under RCW 63.30.220, the holder must pay or deliver to the administrator the property described in the report. Holders who are required to file a report electronically under this chapter must remit payments under this section by electronic funds transfer or other form of electronic payment acceptable to the administrator. However, the administrator, upon request or its own initiative, may relieve any holder or class of holders from the electronic payment requirement under this subsection for good cause as determined by the administrator.

    b. For purposes of this subsection, "good cause" means:

        ii. The administrator determines that relief from the electronic payment requirement under this subsection supports the efficient or effective administration of this chapter.

2. If property in a report under RCW 63.30.220 is an automatically renewable deposit and a penalty or forfeiture in the payment of interest would result from paying the deposit to the administrator at the time of the report, the date for payment of the property to the administrator is extended until a penalty or forfeiture no longer would result from payment, if the holder informs the administrator of the extended date.

3.

If property reported to the administrator under RCW 63.30.220 is a security, the administrator may:

    a. Make an endorsement, instruction, or entitlement order on behalf of the apparent owner to invoke the duty of the issuer, its transfer agent, or the securities intermediary to transfer the security; or

8. A holder is not required to deliver to the administrator a security identified by the holder as a nonfreely transferable security. If the administrator or holder determines that a security is no longer a nonfreely transferable security, the holder must deliver the security on the next regular date prescribed for delivery of securities under this chapter. The holder must make a determination annually whether a security identified in a report filed under RCW 63.30.220 as a nonfreely transferable security is no longer a nonfreely transferable security.

9. If the property reported to the administrator is virtual currency, the holder must liquidate the virtual currency within 30 days before filing the report under RCW 63.30.220. The report and liquidated proceeds must be submitted according to the due dates under RCW 63.30.240.

2. If a claim for a refund under subsection (1) of this section is made for a payment made on a negotiable instrument, including a traveler's check, money order, or similar instrument, the holder must submit proof that the instrument was presented and the payment was made to a person the holder reasonably believed was entitled to the payment. The holder may claim a refund even if the payment was made to a person whose claim was made after the expiration of a period of limitation on the owner's right to receive or recover property, whether specified by contract, statute, or court order.

3. If a holder is paid by the administrator under subsection (1)(b) of this section, and the property was an interest-bearing demand, savings, or time deposit, the holder may also recover from the administrator interest under RCW 63.30.380 that would have been paid to the owner if the money had been claimed from the administrator by the owner to the extent the interest was paid by the holder to the owner.

4. A holder that under this chapter delivers property other than money to the administrator may file a claim for return of the property from the administrator if:

    a. The holder delivered the property to the administrator in error; or

    b. The apparent owner has claimed the property from the holder.

5. If a claim for return of property under subsection (4) of this section is made, the holder must include with the claim evidence sufficient to establish that the apparent owner has claimed the property from the holder or that the property was delivered by the holder to the administrator in error.

    b. [Empty]

        i. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no refund or return of property may be made for any amount or property paid or delivered, or for any interest or penalty paid, more than six years after the end of the calendar year in which the payment or delivery occurred.

        ii. The expiration of the limitations period in (b)(i) of this subsection will not restrict a refund or the return of property if the administrator received a complete application for such refund or return of property before the expiration of such limitations period.

10. The execution of a written waiver signed by the holder and the administrator will extend the time for making a refund of any amounts paid, or a return of property delivered in error, during, or attributable to, the years covered by the waiver if, before the expiration of the waiver, a complete application for refund or return of such amounts or property is made by the holder or the administrator discovers a refund is due or a return of property under this section is required.

11. For purposes of this section, an application for a refund or return of property is complete if it includes information the administrator deems sufficient to substantiate the holder's claim for a refund or return of property.

## Section 15
1. Expiration, before, on, or after January 1, 2023, of a period of limitation on an owner's right to receive or recover property, whether specified by contract, statute, or court order, does not prevent the property from being presumed abandoned or affect the duty of a holder under this chapter to file a report or pay or deliver property to the administrator.
