<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that certain laws governing the eligibility requirements, duties, and responsibilities of sheriffs, police chiefs, and town marshals should be updated and revised to reflect best practices, and to ensure that local law enforcement leaders, whether sheriffs, police chiefs, or town marshals, whether appointed or elected, and whether partisan or nonpartisan, are subject to the same eligibility requirements and standards. For sheriffs, the legislature is authorized to prescribe eligibility requirements. However, other than the eligibility requirements for any elected official, the only requirement for sheriffs in existing law is completion of academy training within 12 months of being elected, and this requirement applies only to persons who have been elected to the office, and not to appointed sheriffs. The legislature may also prescribe eligibility requirements for police chiefs and town marshals, but those requirements have not been updated since 1987. The existing requirements do not include elements such as a minimum age requirement or a prohibition on misconduct that would require denial or revocation of certification. The background check requirement for appointment as a police chief or town marshal has also not been updated in many years, and there is no required background check before appointment or election as a sheriff. The legislature finds that the state Constitution requires it to provide for the duties of elected officials, including sheriffs, for whom duties were first prescribed by the legislature in 1854, but existing law is in part outdated and inconsistent with current values and practices.</p>
<p>For example, there is a need to clarify and reinforce state law that a primary duty of sheriffs, in addition to upholding the United States Constitution, is to uphold and enforce the Washington state Constitution and laws, as enacted by the legislature and interpreted by the Washington supreme court, so as to align state law with the Washington supreme court's ruling in In re Recall of Fortney, 196 Wn.2d 766 (2021).</p>
<p>All persons who serve in law enforcement must maintain peace officer certification, but state law could be clearer regarding what must occur when a sheriff, police chief, or town marshal has their certification revoked, to ensure that the law reflects the same standards of strong accountability for all ranks. By enacting updated, clear, and consistent requirements and standards for all law enforcement leaders, the legislature intends to enhance the effectiveness, professionalism, and accountability of law enforcement leaders, promote public trust and confidence in law enforcement, and increase community safety.</p>
<p>The legislature also finds that these goals can best be met by ensuring the updated standards, requirements, and duties are in effect prior to the filing deadline for 2026 elections, which will include elections for 35 sheriffs.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that the provision in existing law that authorizes sheriffs to &quot;call to their aid such persons, or power of their county as they may deem necessary&quot; has been interpreted by some as authorizing volunteers to enforce criminal laws or civil immigration laws, engage in pursuits, detain or arrest, or use force, without the training and certification required of law enforcement officers and without accountability in the event of misconduct. Volunteers and youth cadets, if used by sheriffs, police chiefs, or town marshals to assist with agency needs, should be limited to the types of roles as enumerated below that do not include this kind of authority, unless the person has completed peace officer training and maintained certification requirements.</p>
<p>Because of this, the legislature also finds that as part of modernizing the duties and responsibilities of law enforcement leaders, there is a need for sheriffs, police chiefs, and town marshals to establish in policy and local law best practices and safeguards for their use of personnel who are not certified peace officers. To do so, law enforcement agencies must have policies, and local jurisdictions must have ordinances, that require the supervision of volunteers, youth cadets, and specially commissioned officers. The policies and ordinances must also circumscribe the use of uniforms, badges, and face coverings by specially commissioned officers, volunteers, and youth cadets, so that members of the public and others can readily distinguish them from peace officers; require appropriate training for any specially commissioned officers and youth cadets authorized to use firearms or other weapons; and prescribe permissible roles for volunteers, which may include, but are not limited to, roles such as technical and administrative support; bicycle recovery; community crime prevention coordination; vehicle maintenance; helping with search and rescue; serving as faith leaders; helping with transport, parking enforcement, and traffic management; assisting with parks and recreation; assisting with animal control and caring for domestic animals, but not using dogs to track people or animals other than for search and rescue, and not using dogs to apprehend, or bite people or animals; and engaging in other public safety-related community service, education, and outreach work.</p>
<p>Finally, the legislature finds that the 1894 chapter in state law regarding use of &quot;police matrons&quot; by police chiefs and town marshals is antiquated and should be repealed.</p>
