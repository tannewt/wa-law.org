    a. Claims submitted for reimbursement under this section must include all the current year centers for medicare and medicaid services required modifiers so that all rebates, incentives, or adjustments that would have applied if reimbursed by medicare apply.

    b. The authority shall adopt rules to determine the equivalent amount of reimbursement for services with a low volume of medicare experience or for which there is no applicable centers for medicare and medicaid services reimbursement for a service.

3. Beginning January 1, 2027, each contractor, for its health plans that provide medical coverage offered to public employees and their covered dependents, must meet the following requirements:

    a. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, reimbursement to any in-network hospital licensed under chapter 70.41 RCW located in Washington for inpatient and outpatient hospital services shall be the lesser of billed charges, the contractor's contracted rate for the hospital, or 200 percent of the total amount medicare would have reimbursed for the same or similar services;

    b. Reimbursement for inpatient and outpatient hospital services to any in-network hospital licensed under chapter 70.41 RCW primarily engaged in the care and treatment of children located in:

        ii. Pierce county, shall be the lesser of billed charges, the contractor's contracted rate for the hospital, or 190 percent of the hospital-specific medicaid inpatient ratio of cost to charges as determined by the authority;

    c.

    d. Reimbursement for in-network primary care services, as defined by the authority, may not be less than 150 percent of the total amount medicare would have reimbursed for the same or similar services;

4. Except as provided in subsection (3)(c) of this section, this section does not apply to:

5. Nothing in this section prohibits a contractor from reimbursing a hospital through a nonfee-for-service payment methodology, so long as the payments incentivize higher quality or improved health outcomes and the contractor continues to comply with the reimbursement requirements in this section.

6. Premiums must take into account changes in reimbursement for hospital, primary care, and behavioral health services anticipated to result from the application of this section.

7. At the request of the authority for monitoring, enforcement, or program and quality improvement activities, a contractor must provide cost and quality of care information and data to the authority and may not enter into an agreement with a provider or third party that would restrict the contractor from providing this information or data.
