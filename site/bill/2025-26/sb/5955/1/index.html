<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the administration of medicaid through managed care organizations has resulted in excessive administrative costs, reduced transparency in financial and clinical decision making, and barriers to timely access to medically necessary care. These outcomes have disproportionately impacted Native American communities, rural residents, individuals with complex health needs, and those navigating behavioral health and disability services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that a managed fee-for-service model, in which providers are paid directly by the state and care coordination is funded separately, will promote transparency, accountability, and equity. This model will reduce administrative overhead, restore public ownership of medicaid data, and ensure that care decisions are made in the best interest of patients rather than corporate shareholders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose of this act is to eliminate financial risk-bearing intermediaries from the state medicaid program and to establish a publicly accountable, managed fee-for-service system that centers care coordination, community oversight, and health equity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
