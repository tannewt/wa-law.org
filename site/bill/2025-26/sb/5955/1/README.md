# SB 5955 - Concerning the medicaid deprivatization act.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5955.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that the administration of medicaid through managed care organizations has resulted in excessive administrative costs, reduced transparency in financial and clinical decision making, and barriers to timely access to medically necessary care. These outcomes have disproportionately impacted Native American communities, rural residents, individuals with complex health needs, and those navigating behavioral health and disability services.

2. The legislature further finds that a managed fee-for-service model, in which providers are paid directly by the state and care coordination is funded separately, will promote transparency, accountability, and equity. This model will reduce administrative overhead, restore public ownership of medicaid data, and ensure that care decisions are made in the best interest of patients rather than corporate shareholders.

3. The purpose of this act is to eliminate financial risk-bearing intermediaries from the state medicaid program and to establish a publicly accountable, managed fee-for-service system that centers care coordination, community oversight, and health equity.

## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Administrative services organization" means an entity contracted by the state to perform administrative functions related to medicaid including, but not limited to, claims processing, prior authorization review, customer service and grievance resolution, and data analytics and utilization monitoring. An administrative services organization shall not assume financial risk for the cost of medicaid services.

2. "Authority" means the Washington health care authority.

3. "Care coordination" means a set of services provided by physicians, nurses, community health workers, behavioral health professionals, and other licensed providers to ensure that patients receive appropriate, timely, and culturally responsive care across the continuum of health services.

4. "Department" means the Washington state department of health.

5. "Financial risk-bearing entity" means any organization that receives capitated payments or assumes financial liability for the cost of medicaid services, including managed care organizations, health maintenance organizations, and other entities operating under risk-based contracts.

6. "Local health jurisdiction" means a geographically designated body that is a local government agency and carries out a wide variety of programs to promote health, help prevent disease, and build healthy communities.

7. "Managed fee-for-service" means a medicaid delivery model in which providers are paid directly by the state through fee-for-service for clinical services, and care coordination is funded through a separate mechanism that does not involve capitation of a risk-bearing fiscal intermediary. Providers of direct care may not be paid with capitation except for a flat monthly care coordination fee paid to practices designated by a beneficiary as the coordinator of their care.

8. "Medicaid" means the joint federal-state program enacted under Title XIX of the social security act that provides health insurance coverage for adults and children with limited income and resources.

## Section 3
1. Beginning July 1, 2026, the authority may not initiate, renew, or extend any contract with a financial risk-bearing entity for the administration of medicaid services. This prohibition shall apply to all programs administered under the authority, including medical assistance programs under chapter 74.09 RCW.

2. All existing contracts with managed care organizations shall terminate no later than December 31, 2026.

3. [Empty]

    a. Beginning January 1, 2027, no fiscal intermediary shall be authorized to receive capitated payments or assume financial risk for medicaid enrollees under any program administered by the state.

    b. Medicaid payments for health care services shall be made directly from the state to providers of care on a fee-for-service basis, with care coordination funded separately.

## Section 4
1. The authority may create a division to perform necessary administrative functions for the maintenance of the state medicaid plan or may contract with one or more administrative services organizations to perform nonrisk administrative functions necessary for the operation of the medicaid program. These functions shall include, but are not limited to:

    a. Human review of prior authorization to ensure that medically necessary services are approved in a timely and equitable manner. AI generated denials of care are not allowed;

    b. Reviewing prior authorizations to ensure that medically necessary services are approved in a timely and equitable manner. Prior authorization should be used as judiciously as possible and only for services prone to nonmedically necessary use. As a nonrisk contractor, the administrative services organization may not have a financial stake in medical necessity determinations;

    c. Providing customer service and grievance resolution to assist enrollees in navigating benefits, resolving disputes, and accessing care;

    d. Using data analytics to evaluate service patterns, identify gaps in care, and support continuous quality improvement;

    e. Processing claims to ensure accurate and timely reimbursement for covered services; and

    f. Providing administrative support for care coordination programs, including scheduling assistance, documentation infrastructure, and technical support for interdisciplinary teams engaged in patient-centered care.

All medicaid enrollees shall access care through a unified statewide provider network that is publicly managed and inclusive of safety net providers, culturally competent practitioners, and geographically distributed services.

3. Administrative services organizations shall comply with all transparency and data-sharing requirements established by the authority, including public reporting of performance metrics, audit results, and stakeholder feedback.

## Section 5
1. The care coordination fund account is created in the state treasury. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation.

2. The authority shall provide flat care coordination payments to any primary care practice designated by a medicaid enrollee as their source of coordinated care. Community-based care coordination services shall be funded through the care coordination fund account based on the cost of operations and community need, and not with capitation based on defined members that would shift insurance risk onto care providers, require risk adjustment, or impose undue administrative burden.

3. The authority shall develop and publish performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of care coordination services. These metrics shall include, but are not limited to:

    a. Data analytics and utilization monitoring to evaluate service delivery;

    b. Identification of gaps in care; and

    c. Support for continuous quality improvement, patient satisfaction, reduction in avoidable hospitalizations, improved chronic disease management, and culturally appropriate service delivery.

4. The authority shall report annually to the legislature on expenditures from the care coordination fund account, provider participation, patient outcomes, and recommendations for improvement.

    a. Identify gaps in service delivery;

    b. Recommend culturally responsive best practices;

    c. Support the implementation of care coordination strategies aligned with the goals of this chapter; and

    d. Report these to the authority and to their respective county councils at least annually.

2. A local health jurisdiction shall convene no less than once per calendar quarter and shall include representation from primary care providers, community health workers, behavioral health specialists, patient advocates, and local public health officials. The department shall ensure that jurisdiction membership reflects the geographic, cultural, and linguistic diversity of the region served.

3. The department shall provide operational funding, technical assistance, and administrative support to each local health jurisdiction. Each jurisdiction shall submit an annual report to the department summarizing its findings, recommendations, and stakeholder engagement activities.

These functions shall not be delegated to any administrative services organization, contractor, or third-party entity.

2. The authority, in collaboration with the department, shall ensure that public health operations are integrated with medicaid services where appropriate, and that coordination between agencies supports continuity of care, emergency preparedness, and population health management.
