<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes that expanding expectations for school districts increases compliance and operational workloads for teachers, administrators, and staff throughout the state. School districts frequently must rely on local levy enrichment funding to meet the requirements of continually more burdensome laws. When mandates are implemented without additional state basic education funding, it places a burden on school districts to choose between compliance and flexibility to fund core instructional priorities.</p>
<p>The legislature intends to relieve burdensome mandated requirements on school districts. The legislature finds that schools are in the best position to determine their funding priorities within the framework provided by the law.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>By November 1, 2020, the department must establish by rule a state energy performance standard for covered buildings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In developing energy performance standards, the department shall seek to maximize reductions of greenhouse gas emissions from the building sector. The standard must include energy use intensity targets by building type and methods of conditional compliance that include an energy management plan, operations and maintenance program, energy efficiency audits, and investment in energy efficiency measures designed to meet the targets. The department shall use ANSI/ASHRAE/IES standard 100-2018 as an initial model for standard development. The department may adopt by rule subsequent versions of standard 100 as its model for standard development. The department must update the standard by July 1, 2029, and every five years thereafter. Prior to the adoption or update of the standard, the department must identify the sources of information it relied upon, including peer-reviewed science.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In establishing the standard under subsection (1) of this section, the department:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Must develop energy use intensity targets that are no greater than the average energy use intensity for the covered building occupancy type with adjustments for unique energy using features. The department must also develop energy use intensity targets for additional property types eligible for incentives in RCW 19.27A.220. The department may also develop targets for alternative metrics related to energy use and greenhouse gas emissions if alternative metrics are included in standard 100-2018 or subsequent versions. The department must consider regional and local building energy utilization data, such as existing energy star benchmarking data, in establishing targets for the standard. Energy use intensity targets or alternative metrics must be developed for two or more climate zones and be representative of energy use in a normal weather year;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May consider building occupancy classifications from ANSI/ASHRAE/IES standard 100 and the United States environmental protection agency's energy star portfolio manager when developing energy use intensity targets;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May implement lower energy use intensity targets or alternative metrics for more recently built covered buildings based on the state energy code in place when the buildings were constructed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Must adopt a conditional compliance method that ensures that covered buildings that do not meet the specified energy use intensity targets or alternative metrics are taking action to achieve reduction in energy use, including investment criteria for conditional compliance that ensure that energy efficiency measures identified by energy audits are implemented to achieve a covered building's energy use intensity target or alternative metric. The investment criteria must require that a building owner adopt an implementation plan to meet the energy intensity target or alternative metric or implement an optimized bundle of energy efficiency measures that provides maximum energy savings without resulting in a savings-to-investment ratio of less than 1.0, except as exempted in (d)(ii) of this subsection. The implementation plan must be based on an investment grade energy audit and a life-cycle cost analysis that accounts for the period during which a bundle of measures will provide savings. The building owner's cost for implementing energy efficiency measures must reflect net cost, excluding any costs covered by utility or government grants. The implementation plan may exclude measures that do not pay for themselves over the useful life of the measure and measures excluded under (d)(ii) of this subsection. The implementation plan may include phased implementation such that the building owner is not required to replace a system or equipment before the end of the system or equipment's useful life;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For those buildings or structures that are listed in the state or national register of historic places; designated as a historic property under local or state designation law or survey; certified as a contributing resource with a national register listed or locally designated historic district; or with an opinion or certification that the property is eligible to be listed on the national or state registers of historic places either individually or as a contributing building to a historic district by the state historic preservation officer or the keeper of the national register of historic places, no individual energy efficiency requirement need be met that would compromise the historical integrity of a building or part of a building;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must provide an alternative compliance pathway for an owner of a state campus district energy system, in accordance with RCW 19.27A.260, and more broadly for the owner of any campus district energy system that is approved by the department to opt-in in accordance with RCW 19.27A.260(6);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must guarantee that the owner of a state campus district energy system is not required to implement more than one energy management plan and more than one operations and maintenance plan for the campus;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must guarantee that a state campus district energy system, as defined in RCW 19.27A.260, and all buildings connected to a state campus district energy system, are in compliance with any requirements for campus buildings to implement energy efficiency measures identified by an energy audit if:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The energy audit demonstrates the energy savings from the state campus district energy system energy efficiency measures will be greater than the energy efficiency measures identified for the campus buildings; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state campus district energy system implements the energy efficiency measures; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>May adopt additional compliance pathways for covered building owners to comply with the standard by meeting alternative metrics.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on records obtained from each county assessor and other available information sources, the department must create a database of covered buildings and building owners required to comply with the standard established in accordance with this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By July 1, 2021, the department must provide the owners of covered buildings with notification of compliance requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must develop a method for administering compliance reports from building owners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must provide a customer support program to building owners including, but not limited to, outreach and informational material, periodic training, phone and email support, and other technical assistance.</p>

<li>
<p>The building owner of a covered building must report the building owner's compliance with the standard to the department in accordance with the schedule established under subsection (8) of this section and every five years thereafter. For each reporting date, the building owner must submit documentation to demonstrate that:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The weather normalized energy use intensity of the covered building measured in the previous calendar year is less than or equal to the energy use intensity target or equal to the alternative metric;</p>

<p>(F) The building is a K-12 school building and the building owner or building tenant is a public school as defined in RCW 28A.150.010, a private school subject to chapter 28A.195 RCW, or a school district. If state funding has been provided in an amount sufficient to improve a K-12 school building to meet the standard, this exemption does not apply.</p>
<p>(G) The building meets at least one of the following conditions of financial hardship: (I) The building had arrears of property taxes or water or wastewater charges that resulted in the building's inclusion, within the prior two years, on a city's or county's annual tax lien sale list; (II) the building has a court appointed receiver in control of the asset due to financial distress; (III) the building is owned by a financial institution through default by a borrower; (IV) the building has been acquired by a deed in lieu of foreclosure within the previous 24 months; (V) the building has a senior mortgage subject to a notice of default; (VI)  the building is a public hospital in a public hospital district that lacks the debt capacity to cover the cost of compliance; or (VII) other conditions of financial hardship identified by the department by rule; or</p>
<p>(H) Extenuating conditions exist, as approved by the department prior to the reporting date including, but not limited to:</p>
<p>(I) Buildings for which meeting the standard would impair the historic integrity of the building including, but not limited to, properties listed in the national register of historic places, the Washington heritage register, or local registers of historic places;</p>
<p>(II) Buildings for which meeting the standard would impair national security interests;</p>
<p>(III) Buildings that have had significant losses in assessed value since the COVID-19 pandemic which prevent building owners from securing capital in the form of loans against equity in the covered building; or</p>
<p>(IV) Other extenuating circumstances identified by the department by rule that may still require benchmarking, operations and maintenance programs, and energy management plan reporting.</p>
<pre><code>b. The covered building owner may apply to the department for an extension to its compliance date. Requests for extension must be received by the department no sooner than six months prior to and up to six months after the applicable compliance date in order to be processed by the department. The department may approve extension requests for conditions including, but not limited to, conditions beyond the control of the building owner. An extension granted pursuant to this subsection is valid for two years beyond the covered building's compliance date after which the covered building owner may apply to the department for an extension renewal or file for an exemption.

<h2 id="section-7">Section 7 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature considers it to be a matter of public safety for public schools and staff to have current safe school plans and procedures in place, fully consistent with federal law. The legislature further finds and intends, by requiring safe school plans to be in place, that school districts will become eligible for federal assistance. The legislature further finds that schools are in a position to serve the community in the event of an emergency resulting from natural disasters or human-induced disasters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Schools and school districts shall consider the guidance and resources provided by the state school safety center, established under RCW 28A.300.630, and the regional school safety centers, established under RCW 28A.310.510, when developing their own individual comprehensive safe school plans. Each school district shall adopt and implement a safe school plan. The plan shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Include required school safety policies and procedures;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Address emergency mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include provisions for assisting and communicating with students and staff, including those with special needs or disabilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include a family-student reunification plan, including procedures for communicating the reunification plan to staff, students, families, and emergency responders;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the training guidance provided by the Washington emergency management division of the state military department in collaboration with the state school safety center in the office of the superintendent of public instruction, established under RCW 28A.300.630, and the school safety and student well-being advisory committee, established under RCW 28A.300.635;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Require the building principal to be certified on the incident command system;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take into account the manner in which the school facilities may be used as a community asset in the event of a community-wide emergency;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set guidelines for requesting city or county law enforcement agencies, local fire departments, emergency service providers, and county emergency management agencies to meet with school districts and participate in safety-related drills; and</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>Include how substitute teachers and other temporary employees receive necessary information about safe school plans, including school safety policies and procedures and the three basic functional drill responses described in subsection (5) of this section.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the extent funds are available, school districts shall annually:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Review and update safe school plans in collaboration with local emergency response agencies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conduct an inventory of all hazardous materials;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update information to reflect current plans, including:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Identifying all staff members who are trained on the national incident management system, trained on the incident command system, or are certified on the incident command system; and</p>
</li>

<p>Provide information to all staff on the use of emergency supplies and notification and alert procedures.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<p>Due to geographic location, schools have unique safety challenges. It is the responsibility of school principals and administrators to assess the threats and hazards most likely to impact their school, and to practice three basic functional drills, shelter-in-place, lockdown, and evacuation, as these drills relate to those threats and hazards. Some threats or hazards may require the use of more than one basic functional drill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Schools are encouraged to conduct at least one safety-related drill per month, including summer months when school is in session with students but must conduct at least three safety-related drills per school year. These drills must teach students three basic functional drill responses:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>&quot;Shelter-in-place,&quot; used to limit the exposure of students and staff to hazardous materials, such as chemical, biological, or radiological contaminants, released into the environment by isolating the inside environment from the outside;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Lockdown,&quot; used to isolate students and staff from threats of violence, such as suspicious trespassers or armed intruders, that may occur in a school or in the vicinity of a school. Lockdown drills may not include live simulations of or reenactments of active shooter scenarios that are not trauma-informed and age and developmentally appropriate; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Evacuation,&quot; used to move students and staff away from threats, such as fires, oil train spills, lahars, or tsunamis.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The drills described in (b) of this subsection must incorporate the following requirements:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>A pedestrian evacuation drill for schools in mapped lahars or tsunami hazard zones; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An earthquake drill using the state-approved earthquake safety technique &quot;drop, cover, and hold.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Schools shall document the date, time, and type (shelter-in-place, lockdown, or evacuate) of each drill required under this subsection (5), and maintain the documentation in the school office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This subsection (5) is intended to satisfy all federal requirements for comprehensive school emergency drills and evacuations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Educational service districts are encouraged to apply for federal emergency response and crisis management grants with the assistance of the superintendent of public instruction and the Washington emergency management division of the state military department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction may adopt rules to implement provisions of this section. These rules may include, but are not limited to, provisions for evacuations, lockdowns, or other components of a comprehensive safe school plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Whenever a first responder agency notifies a school of a situation that may necessitate an evacuation or lockdown, the agency must determine if other known schools in the vicinity are similarly threatened. The first responder agency must notify every other known school in the vicinity for which an evacuation or lockdown appears reasonably necessary to the agency's incident commander unless the agency is unable to notify schools due to duties directly tied to responding to the incident occurring. For purposes of this subsection, &quot;school&quot; includes a private school under chapter 28A.195 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A first responder agency and its officers, agents, and employees are not liable for any act, or failure to act, under this subsection unless a first responder agency and its officers, agents, and employees acted with willful disregard.</p>

<p>If any part of this act is found to be in conflict with federal requirements that are a prescribed condition to the allocation of federal funds to the state, the conflicting part of this act is inoperative solely to the extent of the conflict and with respect to the agencies directly affected, and this finding does not affect the operation of the remainder of this act in its application to the agencies concerned. Rules adopted under this act must meet federal requirements that are a necessary condition to the receipt of federal funds by the state.</p>
