<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that habitat loss, both in quantity and quality, has been identified as one of the greatest risks to survival for salmon and steelhead populations. Hydropower dams and unpassable road culverts block large areas of former salmon habitat. Restoration of habitat is essential for the recovery of salmon and steelhead populations across the west coast and an obligation of the state under the federal injunction issued in United States v. Washington.</p>
<p>The federal court found that the state has a treaty-based duty to refrain from building or operating culverts under state-maintained roads that hinder salmon passage. The cost of reparations is estimated to exceed $5,000,000,000, which cannot be absorbed in current budgets.</p>
<p>The legislature acknowledges both a moral and legal obligation to address salmon habitat and therefore intends to invoke an exceptional remedy to create special tax revenue bonds funded by a tax on light and power utility businesses. The tax is dedicated to improving salmon and steelhead recovery and habitat restoration by addressing projects identified in response to the federal injunction. While the new tax is created to evidence the legislature's commitment to dedicate these funds for the duration of bond repayment, the tax is structured to ensure it will result in no additional obligation to the taxpayer.</p>
