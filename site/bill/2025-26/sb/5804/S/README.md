# SB 5804 - Fish habitat restoration

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5804-S.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that habitat loss, both in quantity and quality, has been identified as one of the greatest risks to survival for salmon and steelhead populations. Hydropower dams and unpassable road culverts block large areas of former salmon habitat. Restoration of habitat is essential for the recovery of salmon and steelhead populations across the west coast and an obligation of the state under the federal injunction issued in United States v. Washington.

The federal court found that the state has a treaty-based duty to refrain from building or operating culverts under state-maintained roads that hinder salmon passage. The cost of reparations is estimated to exceed $5,000,000,000, which cannot be absorbed in current budgets.

The legislature acknowledges both a moral and legal obligation to address salmon habitat and therefore intends to invoke an exceptional remedy to create special tax revenue bonds funded by a tax on light and power utility businesses. The tax is dedicated to improving salmon and steelhead recovery and habitat restoration by addressing projects identified in response to the federal injunction. While the new tax is created to evidence the legislature's commitment to dedicate these funds for the duration of bond repayment, the tax is structured to ensure it will result in no additional obligation to the taxpayer.

## Section 2
1. There is levied and collected from every person a tax for the act or privilege of engaging within this state in any one or more of the businesses herein mentioned. The tax is equal to the gross income of the business, multiplied by the rate set out after the business, as follows:

    a. Express, sewerage collection, and telegraph businesses: Three and six-tenths percent;

    b. Light and power business: 1.741 percent;

    c. Gas distribution business: Three and six-tenths percent;

    d. Urban transportation business: Six-tenths of one percent;

    e. Vessels under sixty-five feet in length, except tugboats, operating upon the waters within the state: Six-tenths of one percent;

    f. Motor transportation, railroad, railroad car, and tugboat businesses, and all public service businesses other than ones mentioned above: One and eight-tenths of one percent;

    g. Water distribution business: Four and seven-tenths percent;

    h. Log transportation business: One and twenty-eight one- hundredths percent. The reduced rate established in this subsection (1)(h) is not subject to the ten-year expiration provision in RCW 82.32.805(1)(a).

2. An additional tax is imposed equal to the rate specified in RCW 82.02.030 multiplied by the tax payable under subsection (1) of this section.

## Section 3
1. There is levied and collected from every person engaging within this state in any light and power business, a tax imposed at the rate of 2.01053 percent, multiplied by the gross income of the business.

2. The moneys collected from the tax pursuant to this section must be deposited in the federal injunction salmon habitat restoration account created in section 11 of this act and must be used exclusively for the purposes of mitigating the impact of fish passage barriers and improving salmon and steelhead recovery and habitat restoration as provided in section 11(2) of this act.

## Section 4
1. Taxes collected under this chapter must be held in trust until paid to the state. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (1), taxes received by the state must be deposited in the  general fund for general purpose expenditures.  Any person collecting the tax who appropriates or converts the tax collected is guilty of a gross misdemeanor if the money required to be collected is not available for payment on the date payment is due. If a taxpayer fails to pay the tax imposed by this chapter to the person charged with collection of the tax and the person charged with collection fails to pay the tax to the department, the department may, in its discretion, proceed directly against the taxpayer for collection of the tax.

2. The tax is due from the taxpayer within twenty-five days from the date the taxpayer is billed by the person collecting the tax.

3. The tax is due from the person collecting the tax at the end of the tax period in which the tax is received from the taxpayer. If the taxpayer remits only a portion of the total amount billed for taxes, consideration, and related charges, the amount remitted must be applied first to payment of the solid waste collection tax and this tax has priority over all other claims to the amount remitted.

## Section 5
The amounts received for the tax imposed on each sale of real property under RCW 82.45.060 must be deposited as follows:

1. 1.4 percent must be deposited into the city-county assistance account created in RCW 43.08.290;

2. 84.6 percent must be deposited into the general fund; and

3. The remainder must be deposited into the education legacy trust account created in RCW 83.100.230.

## Section 6
