## Section 1
1. The department shall contract for the acquisition of clean diesel ferry vessels that can carry between 125 and 140 vehicles and no more than 1,200 passengers. The department may use a multiple contract procurement approach to potentially accelerate vessel delivery.

2. [Empty]

    a. Prior to issuing a request for proposals from bidders, the department shall seek input from the maritime shipbuilding industry on ferry construction best practices.

    b. The contract or contracts must be for a minimum of three vessels and are exempt from the requirements set forth in RCW 47.60.810 through 47.60.824.

    c. The contract or contracts may employ the following procurement methods:

        i. Design-build procedure as authorized under chapter 39.10 RCW;

        ii. Design-bid-build as authorized under chapter 39.04 RCW or an equivalent process allowed in statute as determined by the department; or

        iii. Lease with an option to buy in accordance with RCW 47.60.010. The terms of any plan to pursue a lease with an option to buy agreement must be approved by the governor and appropriate committees of the legislature and are subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose.

    d. The department must award a credit of 13 percent of the bid price for bid proposals for vessels constructed in the state of Washington, which must be adjusted to reflect the proportion of the construction of the vessels that occurs within the state. This credit represents the:

        i. Amount of economic and revenue loss to the state of Washington from constructing vessels outside the state of Washington, as indicated by the Washington institute for public policy study regarding Washington state ferry vessel procurement dated December 2016; and

        ii. Additional costs of transport, potential delay, and owner oversight incurred for construction at shipyards located outside the state of Washington.

    e. The department may not limit the means of transportation utilized for the delivery voyage of any vessel acquired pursuant to this act.

3. Any new ferry contract signed under this section must guarantee a delivery date on or before December 31, 2032.

4. The department shall report to the governor and the transportation committees of the legislature on any known project delivery issues that may delay or hinder the delivery of vessels within three months of the effective date of this section.
