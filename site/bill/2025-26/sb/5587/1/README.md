## Section 1
1. The Washington center for real estate research at the University of Washington shall produce a series of reports as described in this section that compiles housing supply and affordability metrics for each city planning under RCW 36.70A.040 with a population of 10,000 or more.

    a. The initial report, completed by October 15, 2020, must be a compilation of objective criteria relating to income, employment, housing and rental prices, housing affordability by housing tenure, and other metrics relevant to assessing housing supply and affordability for all income segments, including the percentage of cost-burdened households of each jurisdiction. This report may also include city-specific median income data for those cities implementing the multifamily tax exemption program under chapter 84.14 RCW.

    b. The report completed by October 15, 2021, must include an analysis of the private rental housing market for each area outlining the number of units, vacancy rates, and rents by unit type, where possible. This analysis should separate market rate multifamily rental housing developments and other smaller scale market rate rental housing. This analysis should also incorporate data from the Washington state housing finance commission on subsidized rental housing in the area consistent with the first report under this subsection.

    c. The report completed by October 15, 2022, must also include data relating to actions taken by cities under chapter 348, Laws of 2019 as well as detailed information on development regulations, levies and fees, and zoning related to housing development.

    d. The report completed by October 15, 2024, and every two years thereafter, must also include relevant data relating to buildable lands reports prepared under RCW 36.70A.215, where applicable, and updates to comprehensive plans under this chapter.

    e. The report completed by October 15, 2026, and every two years thereafter, must also include:

        i. An analysis of the estimated existing housing units and existing housing needs within each county at the following income levels: 0 to 30 percent of the area median income, 30 to 50 percent of the area median income, 50 to 80 percent of the area median income, 80 to 100 percent of the area median income, 100 to 120 percent of the area median income, and greater than 120 percent of the area median income;

        ii. Each county's progress in closing the gap between estimated existing housing units within the county and existing housing needs; and

        iii. Each county's progress in meeting emergency housing, emergency shelters, and permanent supportive housing needs within the county.

2. The Washington center for real estate research shall collaborate with the Washington housing finance commission and the office of financial management to develop the metrics compiled in the series of reports under this section.

3. The series of reports under this section must be submitted, consistent with RCW 43.01.036, to the standing committees of the legislature with jurisdiction over housing issues and this chapter.

## Section 2
1. If the report produced under RCW 36.70A.610 finds that a county's gap between estimated existing housing units and existing housing needs has not decreased from the preceding year, the county, or any city within the county may not deny an affordable housing development, or approve an affordable housing development with conditions or restrictions that have a substantial adverse impact on the viability of the development or the degree of affordability of the development unless at least one of the following conditions is met:

    a. The denial of the affordable housing development, or the approval of the affordable housing development with conditions or restrictions that have a substantial adverse impact on the viability of the development or the degree of affordability of the development, is required in order to comply with specific state or federal law;

    b. The affordable housing development or proposed development site is located outside an urban growth area, in a critical area, in a critical area buffer, or in an area where residential uses are not allowed by the applicable shoreline master program; or

    c. The affordable housing development or proposed development site is located in an area where neither the local jurisdiction's comprehensive plan nor zoning ordinance permits residential or mixed uses.

2. The county or city must require the developer of an affordable housing development to include legally binding, enforceable restrictions on the development, recorded as a covenant or deed restriction, to ensure that the measures of affordability described in subsection (5) of this section are met for a minimum 25-year period. The county or city must periodically audit compliance with the restrictions or provide another mechanism to ensure that the units committed to affordable housing meet the measures of affordability described in subsection (5) of this section during the agreed term.

3. Permits for affordable housing development under this section must be given priority by the city or county and processed prior to any other permit applications.

4. A county or city subject to the requirements of this section is eligible to receive funds under chapter 43.155 RCW to defray infrastructure and clean water costs related to infill development and any other increase in affordable housing units.

5. For the purpose of this section "affordable housing development" or "affordable housing" means a residential housing development where the developer has agreed to include legally binding, enforceable restrictions on the development, recorded as a covenant or deed restriction, to ensure that for at least 25 years:

    a. At least 20 percent of the units are for rental housing with monthly costs that do not exceed 30 percent of the monthly income of a household whose income is at or below 80 percent of the median household income adjusted for household size, for the county where the household is located, as reported by the United States department of housing and urban development; and

    b. All remaining units are for rental housing with monthly costs that do not exceed 30 percent of the monthly income of a household whose income is more than 80 percent but is at or below 115 percent of the median household income adjusted for household size, for the county where the household is located, as reported by the United States department of housing and urban development.

## Section 3

    b. The local government must have developed a capital facility plan; and

    c. The local government must be using all local revenue sources which are reasonably available for funding public works, taking into consideration local employment and economic factors.

2.
