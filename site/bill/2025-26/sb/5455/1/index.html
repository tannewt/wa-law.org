Appointments must be made on or before July 1, 2016.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The term of a member is four years from the date of their appointment except the initial term of the members in subsection (1)(d) through (i) of this section must be two years to create a staggered appointment process. A member may be appointed to not more than two full consecutive terms. A member appointed by the governor may be removed by the governor for cause under RCW 43.06.070 and 43.06.080. The members may not be compensated but may be reimbursed, solely from the fund, for expenses incurred in the discharge of their duties under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seven members of the board constitute a quorum.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>The board must be staffed by one or more program administrators selected by and under contract with the board.

The board may select and contract directly with any program administrator. The program administrator must be paid an administrative fee as determined by the board and paid mutually agreed-upon operating costs which may vary depending on the endowment's activities.</p>
