# SB 6089 - Education data/P20W system

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6089.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature recognizes that equitable and accessible pathways across Washington's P20W system require greater alignment and coordination among state agencies, educational institutions, and workforce partners. The legislature further acknowledges the significant role that the philanthropic community can play in advancing efforts from early learning through K-12 education, postsecondary education, and into the workforce. At each transition point in the continuum, opportunities exist to strengthen internal coordination and build upon ongoing initiatives across the sectors. The legislature also recognizes that the absence of shared metrics to assess statewide progress and accountability toward common goals limits the P20W system's ability to achieve equitable outcomes for all Washingtonians and may make it difficult for the philanthropic community to understand where their efforts could make the most impact within the entirety of the system.

2. The legislature therefore intends to enhance Washington's education and workforce landscape by establishing a structured partnership between the state and the philanthropic community. This partnership is intended to identify, elevate, and support the work and visions already being pursued across the P20W continuum, and to create an official venue for aligning funding priorities, coordinating efforts, and fostering collaboration. Through this partnership, the state and the philanthropic community will work together to strengthen existing initiatives and communicate shared priorities in a clear and coordinated manner to the broader public.

3. The legislature further intends to review and compile the ongoing and historical work of state agencies, councils, and advisory boards to identify current goals, strategies, and plans. Building upon this foundation, the state, in collaboration with the philanthropic community, will determine where targeted partnerships can advance, expand, or better support policies and programs that align with shared commitments of equity and student success. The legislature intends that this process will strengthen and update Washington's P20W system to address the state's evolving needs, support long-term implementation of these shared priorities, and increase transparency and public understanding of the system's direction.

4. The legislature finds that improved alignment, coordination, and transparent communication, supported through strong state-philanthropic partnerships, will enhance student preparation for an increasingly global economy and ensure Washington continues to lead in providing a robust, inclusive P20W system from early learning through K-12 education, postsecondary pathways, and the workforce.

## Section 2
1. For the purposes of this section and section 3 of this act, "P20W" means prekindergarten to grade 20 to workforce and encompasses the transitions from early learning to K-12 education to postsecondary education and career pathways to workforce. Career pathways include, but are not limited to, apprenticeships, certification, and licensure programs.

2. The P20W public-private partnership account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. All receipts from gifts, grants, or endowments from public or private sources, federal funds, any appropriations made by the legislature, or other sources for the purposes specified in subsection (3) of this section and section 3 of this act must be deposited in the account.

3. Expenditures from the account may be used only for:

    a. The office of financial management to contract with a nonprofit organization with expertise in national and Washington state comparative education policy development to identify ongoing and historical work undertaken by state agencies, councils, advisory boards, and the philanthropic community related to the P20W system. The contracted nonprofit organization shall facilitate increased coordination and alignment between the state and the philanthropic community in support of implementing the state's P20W vision; and

    b. The office of financial management to contract with a nonprofit organization with relevant expertise related to Washington data systems to create a public-facing P20W data dashboard.
