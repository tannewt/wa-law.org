<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the agricultural economy in Washington state is struggling for viability. A recent study from the United States department of agriculture found that Washington state farmers come in last with regard to farm income; in fact, Washington agriculture had a negative income this year. Over the last four years, the income to Washington farmers has steadily decreased. Washington farmers raise over 300 different crops and Washington agriculture is one of the top industries in the state. In 2023, Washington's agricultural production was worth nearly $14,000,000,000. However, with an average of two farms a day closing since 2017, agriculture in Washington can hardly persist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that increasing costs of government regulation is a key component of the overwhelming stress faced by the industry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends that regulatory agencies whose actions most affect agriculture need to consider the effect of their rules and enforcement actions on agriculture. The viability of agriculture has not been a part of rule-making analysis before now, but in order to preserve this economy in Washington state, the legislature finds that it is crucial to ensure that the government is not causing more harm to the industry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The food policy forum has made several recommendations to protect agriculture and agricultural land. In the 2022 report &quot;Land Use Policy Solutions to Stem Agricultural Land Loss,&quot; the forum recommends a series of agricultural impact statements before actions that could lead to the loss of land in agriculture. According to the report, 640,000 acres of land in farms was lost between 2002 and 2017. This loss is devastating to the industry and to the ability of the next generation to continue farming. The legislature finds that a combination of impact statements and mitigation is an essential tool to preserve farmland, and thereby the continued viability of agriculture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The legislature declares that it is the continuing policy of the state of Washington, in cooperation with federal and local governments and other concerned public and private organizations, to use all practicable means and measures, including financial and technical assistance, in a manner calculated to:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Promote a stable food supply by maintaining a healthy agricultural economy in Washington state; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that the regulatory environment does not adversely affect the ability of Washington's farmers to continue to grow and sell their products to feed citizens of Washington state and the world.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to carry out the policy set forth in this act, it is the continuing responsibility of the state of Washington, particularly the state agencies that affect the use of natural resources, namely the department of natural resources, the department of fish and wildlife, the state conservation commission, the department of ecology, the forest practices board, the department of labor and industries, and the department of commerce, to use all practicable means, consistent with other essential considerations of state policy, to improve and coordinate plans, functions, programs, and resources in order to:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Promote agriculture while protecting public health and welfare and the environment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide opportunities for farmers and ranchers to utilize agricultural land to produce agricultural products;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aid farmers and landowners in utilizing the land for the best combination of production, habitat, carbon sequestration, and any combination of commercial and conservation activities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preserve historical, cultural, and natural aspects of our national heritage of agriculture;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Balance the requirements of chapters 36.70A and 43.21C RCW, and other environmental policies of the state with the future viability of agriculture.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature authorizes and directs that, to the fullest extent possible, the policies, regulations, and laws of the state of Washington shall be interpreted and administered in accordance with the policies set forth in this chapter and that the department of natural resources, the department of fish and wildlife, the department of ecology, the forest practices board, the department of labor and industries, or the department of commerce shall:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Utilize systematic, interdisciplinary approaches, methods, and procedures to ensure the integrated use of the natural and social sciences in planning and decision making with respect to issues that have an impact on the agricultural economy in Washington state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify and develop methods and procedures, in consultation with the department and the state conservation commission, which will ensure that the viability of agricultural activities will be given appropriate consideration in decision-making, along with regulatory requirements, economic, and technical considerations;</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Include in every recommendation or report on proposals for agency request legislation, legislative reports, rule-making actions, or policy development that significantly affect agriculture, an agricultural impact statement developed by the director or the director's designee regarding:</p>

<li>
<p>The economic impact of the proposed action on the conduct of agriculture in Washington;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any adverse effects that cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatives to the proposed action;</p>

<ol type="a" start="2">
<li>Before making any detailed statement, the responsible official or the official's designee shall request consultation with and obtain comments from an economist employed by a land grant university or the department; and</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Study, develop, and describe appropriate alternatives to recommended courses of action in any proposed action that involves unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources, including mitigation required in section 4 of this act for any loss of use of land or loss of commercial opportunities due to any agency action.</p>

<li>
<p>The director of financial management or the director's designee, in cooperation with appropriate legislative committees and legislative staff, must establish a mechanism for the determination of the fiscal impact of proposed legislation that, if enacted into law, would directly or indirectly increase or decrease regulatory costs incurred by entities engaged in agriculture. The office of financial management shall, when requested by a member of the state legislature, report in writing as to the fiscal impact and the report may be known as a fiscal note. The office of financial management must consult with an agricultural economist employed by the department for an accurate depiction of economic impacts to agriculture in Washington.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this subsection, &quot;entities engaged in agriculture&quot; includes entities registered with the office of the secretary of state as engaged in the manufacturing, production, or processing of agricultural products.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fiscal notes must indicate by fiscal year the total impact on the agricultural economy for the first two years the legislation would be in effect and also a cumulative six-year forecast of the fiscal impact. Where feasible and applicable, the fiscal note must also indicate the fiscal impact on each industry or a representative sampling of the industry broadly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A fiscal note must be provided only upon request of a member of the state legislature. A request for a fiscal note on legislation is considered to be a continuing request for a fiscal note on any formal alteration of the legislation in the form of an amendment to the legislation that is adopted by a committee or a chamber of the legislature or a substitute version of the legislation that is adopted by a committee and preparation of the fiscal note on the prior version of the legislation must stop, unless the legislator requesting the fiscal note specifies otherwise or the altered version is first adopted or enacted in the last week of a legislative session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fiscal notes must be completed within one week of the request unless an extended time period is authorized by the requesting legislator. In the event a fiscal note has not been completed within one week of a request, a daily report must be prepared for the requesting legislator by the director of financial management. The daily report must summarize the progress in preparing the fiscal note. If the request is referred to the director of agriculture, the daily report must also include the date and time such referral was made.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<p>If the department of natural resources, the department of fish and wildlife, the department of ecology, the forest practices board, or the department of commerce proposes an action that will result in the deprivation of the beneficial use of the real property to such an extent that the deprivation results in the loss of financial benefit from the current or future use of property engaged in agriculture or other natural resourced based commercial activities, the department proposing the action must propose mitigation measures in the following sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Avoidance of impacts through technical assistance or amendment of such proposal;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where avoidance of adverse impacts is not reasonably attainable, minimizing impacts by providing permanent access to replacement acreage either from state land controlled by that agency or in cooperation with other agencies that control access to state lands;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where avoidance and minimization are not reasonably attainable, compensating for adverse impacts by providing in-kind mitigation or financial compensation for lost property from the habitat conservation account established in RCW 79A.15.040.</p>

<li>
<p>Each county that is required or chooses to plan under RCW 36.70A.040 shall designate an urban growth area or areas within which urban growth shall be encouraged and outside of which growth can occur only if it is not urban in nature. Each city that is located in such a county shall be included within an urban growth area. An urban growth area may include more than a single city. An urban growth area may include territory that is located outside of a city only if such territory already is characterized by urban growth whether or not the urban growth area includes a city, or is adjacent to territory already characterized by urban growth, or is a designated new fully contained community as defined by RCW 36.70A.350. When a federally recognized Indian tribe whose reservation or ceded lands lie within the county or city has voluntarily chosen to participate in the planning process pursuant to RCW 36.70A.040, the county or city and the tribe shall coordinate their planning efforts for any areas planned for urban growth consistent with the terms outlined in the memorandum of agreement provided for in RCW 36.70A.040(8).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based upon the growth management population projection made for the county by the office of financial management, the county and each city within the county shall include areas and densities sufficient to permit the urban growth that is projected to occur in the county or city for the succeeding 20-year period, except for those urban growth areas contained totally within a national historical reserve. As part of this planning process, each city within the county must include areas sufficient to accommodate the broad range of needs and uses that will accompany the projected urban growth including, as appropriate, medical, governmental, institutional, commercial, service, retail, and other nonresidential uses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each urban growth area shall permit urban densities and shall include greenbelt and open space areas. In the case of urban growth areas contained totally within a national historical reserve, the city may restrict densities, intensities, and forms of urban growth as determined to be necessary and appropriate to protect the physical, cultural, or historic integrity of the reserve. An urban growth area determination may include a reasonable land market supply factor and shall permit a range of urban densities and uses. In determining this market factor, cities and counties may consider local circumstances. Cities and counties have discretion in their comprehensive plans to make many choices about accommodating growth.</p>
<p>Within one year of July 1, 1990, each county that as of June 1, 1991, was required or chose to plan under RCW 36.70A.040, shall begin consulting with each city located within its boundaries and each city shall propose the location of an urban growth area. Within 60 days of the date the county legislative authority of a county adopts its resolution of intention or of certification by the office of financial management, all other counties that are required or choose to plan under RCW 36.70A.040 shall begin this consultation with each city located within its boundaries. The county shall attempt to reach agreement with each city on the location of an urban growth area within which the city is located. If such an agreement is not reached with each city located within the urban growth area, the county shall justify in writing why it so designated the area an urban growth area. A city may object formally with the department over the designation of the urban growth area within which it is located. Where appropriate, the department shall attempt to resolve the conflicts, including the use of mediation services.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Urban growth should be located first in areas already characterized by urban growth that have adequate existing public facility and service capacities to serve such development, second in areas already characterized by urban growth that will be served adequately by a combination of both existing public facilities and services and any additional needed public facilities and services that are provided by either public or private sources, and third in the remaining portions of the urban growth areas. Urban growth may also be located in designated new fully contained communities as defined by RCW 36.70A.350.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In general, cities are the units of local government most appropriate to provide urban governmental services. In general, it is not appropriate that urban governmental services be extended to or expanded in rural areas except in those limited circumstances shown to be necessary to protect basic public health and safety and the environment and when such services are financially supportable at rural densities and do not permit urban development and as authorized in RCW 36.70A.830.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On or before October 1, 1993, each county that was initially required to plan under RCW 36.70A.040(1) shall adopt development regulations designating interim urban growth areas under this chapter. Within three years and three months of the date the county legislative authority of a county adopts its resolution of intention or of certification by the office of financial management, all other counties that are required or choose to plan under RCW 36.70A.040 shall adopt development regulations designating interim urban growth areas under this chapter. Adoption of the interim urban growth areas may only occur after public notice; public hearing; and compliance with the state environmental policy act, chapter 43.21C RCW, and under this section. Such action may be appealed to the growth management hearings board under RCW 36.70A.280. Final urban growth areas shall be adopted at the time of comprehensive plan adoption under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each county shall include designations of urban growth areas in its comprehensive plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An urban growth area designated in accordance with this section may include within its boundaries urban service areas or potential annexation areas designated for specific cities or towns within the county.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If, during the county's annual review under RCW 36.70A.130(2)(a), the county determines revision of the urban growth area is not required to accommodate the population projection for the county made by the office of financial management for the succeeding 20-year period, but does determine that patterns of development have created pressure for development in areas exceeding the amount of available developable lands within the urban growth area, then the county may revise the urban growth area or areas based on identified patterns of development and likely future development pressure if the following requirements are met:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The revised urban growth area would not result in a net increase in the total acreage or development capacity of the urban growth area or areas;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county completes an agricultural impact statement as described in section 2(3)(a) of this act if the revised urban growth area contains land that is currently zoned for agricultural use;</p>

<p>If the areas added to the urban growth area have previously been designated as agricultural, forest, or mineral resource lands of long-term commercial significance, either an equivalent amount of agricultural, forest, or mineral resource lands of long-term commercial significance must be added to the area outside of the urban growth area, or the county must wait a minimum of two years before another swap may occur;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Less than 15 percent of the areas added to the urban growth area are critical areas other than critical aquifer recharge areas. Critical aquifer recharge areas must have been previously designated by the county and be maintained per county development regulations within the expanded urban growth area and the revised urban growth area must not result in a net increase in critical aquifer recharge areas within the urban growth area;</p>

<p>(A) Public facilities already exist within the floodplain and the expansion of an existing public facility is only possible on the land to be included in the urban growth area and located within the floodplain; or</p>
<p>(B) Urban development already exists within a floodplain as of July 26, 2009, and is adjacent to, but outside of, the urban growth area, and the expansion of the urban growth area is necessary to include such urban development within the urban growth area; or</p>
<p>(C) The land is owned by a jurisdiction planning under this chapter or the rights to the development of the land have been permanently extinguished, and the following criteria are met:</p>
<p>(I) The permissible use of the land is limited to one of the following: Outdoor recreation; environmentally beneficial projects including, but not limited to, habitat enhancement or environmental restoration; stormwater facilities; flood control facilities; or underground conveyances; and</p>
<p>(II) The development and use of such facilities or projects will not decrease flood storage, increase stormwater runoff, discharge pollutants to fresh or salt waters during normal operations or floods, or increase hazards to people and property.</p>
<pre><code>c. For the purposes of this subsection (10), &quot;100-year floodplain&quot; means the same as &quot;special flood hazard area&quot; as set forth in WAC 173-158-040 as it exists on July 26, 2009.
