<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Memory care&quot; is not well-defined and has no standard definition in Washington. Memory care, however, is commonly understood to be a form of specialized care for people living with progressive memory loss or dementia. The term is most often applied to assisted living communities or other residential settings that offer specialized services and a specially designed environment that accommodates the needs of this population;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A growing number of assisted living facilities use memory care in their names or their service descriptions and advertise themselves as providing memory care, Alzheimer's care, or dementia care. An informal study performed by the dementia action collaborative in 2021 found that there are approximately 237 assisted living facilities in Washington that advertise themselves as offering memory care or specialized dementia care, and that exact terminology and related available services varied. The use of the term &quot;memory care&quot; may mean that the whole building is devoted to the care of people living with dementia or that they offer a special unit or wing devoted solely to memory care; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lack of a standard definition for memory care has resulted in differing physical environments and services from one facility to another. This situation makes it difficult for consumers and family members who are seeking or receiving care to understand the services and staffing currently offered and that can be expected as needs change over time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to create a memory care facility certification for licensed assisted living facilities, managed by the department of social and health services, to create a more standardized definition of memory care in Washington and help consumers make informed choices about receiving memory care services in assisted living facilities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>After July 1, 2026, a person may not operate or maintain a memory care facility or memory care unit within this state without becoming certified under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To become certified by the department as a memory care facility or memory care unit, a licensed assisted living facility must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Provide proof of valid contract with the department to provide dementia care services at an enhanced rate for medicaid clients; or</p>
</li>
<li>

<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Have a valid, current license to operate the assisted living facility, as required under RCW 18.20.030;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not have any of the following uncorrected significant enforcement actions in the 12 months prior to the date of application:</p>
</li>
</ol>

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) Citations issued in areas that adversely affect resident care;</p>
<p>(B) Civil fines based on the department's determination of moderate or serious severity;</p>
<p>(C) A stop placement, or any conditions on a license related to resident care; or</p>
<p>(D) Any license revocation or summary suspension actions;</p>
<pre><code>    iii. Not have an established pattern of repeated citations or significant enforcement actions that adversely affect resident care in the 24 months prior to the date of application;

    iv. Have permanent building structure that provides a separate wing, unit, or building for memory care where residents will reside and that meets the needs of residents with dementia, including elements intended to prevent elopement such as restricted egress;

v. Complete a full assessment of each resident receiving care in the memory care facility or memory care unit on at a minimum a semiannual basis that includes a generalized dementia care assessment;

vi. Maintain staffing levels in the memory care portions of the assisted living facility that are appropriate to meet the unique needs of residents with dementia, including:
</code></pre>
<p>(A) Maintaining awake staff 24 hours per day at a level that is adequate to respond to the assessed sleeping and waking patterns and needs of residents;</p>
<p>(B) Maintaining staffing levels adequate to routinely provide assistance with eating, drinking, and cueing of eating and drinking, and occasionally provide all necessary physical assistance with eating for residents who require feeding assistance, including cutting up food into appropriate-sized pieces and helping the resident get food and liquid into their mouth. Nothing in this subsection (2)(b)(vi)(B) shall be construed as requiring a memory care facility or memory care unit to provide total feeding assistance for an extended or indefinite period. Memory care facilities or memory care units are not required to provide or maintain feeding tubes or intravenous nutrition;</p>
<p>(C) Ensuring that each staff member who works directly with memory care residents has at least six hours of continuing education per year related to dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. The six hours of continuing education per year may be part of other required training established in this chapter and chapter 18.88B RCW. Appropriate topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>(I) Caregiving strategies and skills for agitation and de-escalation;</p>

<pre><code>vii. Provide programming that provides daily activities consistent with the functional abilities, interests, habits, and preferences of the individual residents. On a daily basis, except during the activation of the disaster preparedness plan, a memory care facility or memory care unit must:
</code></pre>
<p>(A) Provide residents access to:</p>
<p>(I) Opportunities for independent, self-directed activities;</p>
<p>(II) Individual activities in which a staff person or volunteer engages the resident in a planned or spontaneous activity of interest. Activities may include personal care activities that provide opportunities for purposeful and positive interactions; and</p>
<p>(III) Group activities;</p>
<p>(B) Offer opportunities for activities that accommodate variations in a resident's mood, energy, and preferences. The memory care facility or memory care unit must make appropriate activities available based upon the resident's individual schedule and interests, such as providing access to staff support, food, and appropriate activities to residents who are awake at night;</p>
<p>(C) Make available multiple common areas that could be shared with other residents within the assisted living facility, at least one of which is outdoors when possible, that vary by size and arrangement including, but not limited to: Various size furniture groupings that encourage social interaction; areas with environmental cues that may stimulate activity, such as a resident kitchen or workshop; areas with activity supplies and props to stimulate conversation; a garden area; and paths and walkways that encourage exploration and walking.

<pre><code>    ix. Ensure that areas used by residents have a residential atmosphere and residents have opportunities for privacy, socialization, and safe walking and wandering behaviors, including:
</code></pre>
<p>(A) Encouraging residents' individualized spaces to be furnished or decorated with personal items based on resident needs and preferences; and</p>
<p>(B) Ensuring residents have access to their own rooms at all times without staff assistance; and</p>
<pre><code>x. Have developed policies and procedures to:
</code></pre>
<p>(A) Plan for and respond appropriately to memory care facility or memory care unit residents who may wander;</p>
<p>(B) Outline actions to be taken when a memory care resident is missing; and</p>
<p>(C) Outline how consultative resources to address resident behavioral challenges for residents will be obtained when needed, outline the professional or professionals who will provide the consultation, and specify when and how the consultation will be utilized.

<li>
<p>The department shall maintain a register of assisted living facilities that are certified as memory care facilities or memory care units and shall make this register available to the public and consumers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An assisted living facility must apply to the department to become certified and pay any fees and provide any information as the department requires by rule to demonstrate the facility meets the requirements of subsection (2) of this section and any implementing rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the course of its regular licensing inspection activities, the department shall review whether a certified memory care facility or memory care unit continues to comply with requirements in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any assisted living facility that goes through a change of ownership shall submit an application for certification as a memory care facility at the same time that it applies for an assisted living facility license through a change of ownership proceeding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall provide a current registration document to the memory care facility or memory care unit and require that the document is posted in a public area for residents, their families, and visitors to view upon entering the main entrance of the memory care facility or memory care unit.</p>

<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the practices covered by section 2(1) of this act, the operation of a memory care facility without a certification, are matters vitally affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW. A violation of this chapter is not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business and is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce and an unfair method of competition for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This chapter may be enforced by the attorney general under the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW.</p>

An assisted living facility does not need to specifically use the terms &quot;memory care facility,&quot; &quot;specialized dementia care,&quot; or similar terms in its advertising or name to be considered a memory care facility under this chapter. If any part of an assisted living facility has restricted egress, it is sufficient to be considered as a memory care facility or memory care unit under this chapter.</p>

<p>The department of social and health services is authorized to take one or more of the actions listed in subsection (2) of this section in any case in which the department finds that an assisted living facility provider has:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Failed or refused to comply with the requirements of this chapter or the rules adopted under this chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operated an assisted living facility without a license or under a revoked license;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowingly, or with reason to know, made a false statement of material fact on his or her application for license or any data attached thereto, or in any matter under investigation by the department;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Willfully prevented or interfered with any inspection or investigation by the department;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continued to use terminology such as &quot;memory care facility&quot; or &quot;dementia care facility&quot; without having been issued a certificate under section 2 of this act; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continued to operate a facility or unit within a facility that has restricted egress without having been issued a certificate under section 2 of this act.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>When authorized by subsection (1) of this section, the department may take one or more of the following actions, using a tiered sanction grid that considers the extent of harm from the deficiency and the regularity of the occurrence of the deficiency when imposing civil fines:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Refuse to issue a license;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impose reasonable conditions on a license, such as correction within a specified time, training, and limits on the type of clients the provider may admit or serve;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impose civil penalties of at least one hundred dollars per day per violation. Until July 1, 2019, the civil penalties may not exceed one thousand dollars per day per violation. Beginning July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2020, the civil penalties may not exceed two thousand dollars per day per violation. Beginning July 1, 2020, the civil penalties may not exceed three thousand dollars per day per violation;</p>

<li>
<p>Suspend admissions to the assisted living facility, memory care facility, or memory care unit by imposing stop placement; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suspend admission of a specific category or categories of residents as related to the violation by imposing a limited stop placement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the department orders stop placement or a limited stop placement, the facility shall not admit any new resident until the stop placement or limited stop placement order is terminated. The department may approve readmission of a resident to the facility from a hospital or nursing home during the stop placement or limited stop placement. The department shall terminate the stop placement or limited stop placement when: (a) The violations necessitating the stop placement or limited stop placement have been corrected; and (b) the provider exhibits the capacity to maintain correction of the violations previously found deficient. However, if upon the revisit the department finds new violations that the department reasonably believes will result in a new stop placement or new limited stop placement, the previous stop placement or limited stop placement shall remain in effect until the new stop placement or new limited stop placement is imposed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a department finding of a violation for which a stop placement or limited stop placement has been imposed, the department shall make an on-site revisit of the provider within fifteen working days from the request for revisit, to ensure correction of the violation. For violations that are serious or recurring or uncorrected following a previous citation, and create actual or threatened harm to one or more residents' well-being, including violations of residents' rights, the department shall make an on-site revisit as soon as appropriate to ensure correction of the violation. Verification of correction of all other violations may be made by either a department on-site revisit or by written or photographic documentation found by the department to be credible. This subsection does not prevent the department from enforcing license suspensions or revocations. Nothing in this subsection shall interfere with or diminish the department's authority and duty to ensure that the provider adequately cares for residents, including to make departmental on-site revisits as needed to ensure that the provider protects residents, and to enforce compliance with this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RCW 43.20A.205 governs notice of a license denial, revocation, suspension, or modification. Chapter 34.05 RCW applies to department actions under this section, except that orders of the department imposing license suspension, stop placement, limited stop placement, or conditions for continuation of a license are effective immediately upon notice and shall continue pending any hearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All receipts from civil penalties imposed under this chapter must be deposited in the assisted living facility temporary management account created in RCW 18.20.430.</p>
