Compliance with this chapter by the operator of an addictive internet-based service or application does not serve as a defense to any claim that a minor, or an individual who was a minor at the time of using the internet-based service or application, might have against the operator of an addictive internet-based service or application regarding any harm to the mental health or well-being of the minor.

## Section 11
The legislature finds that the practices covered by this chapter are matters vitally affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW.

## Section 12
It is the intent of the legislature that if any provision of this chapter or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the chapter or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.
