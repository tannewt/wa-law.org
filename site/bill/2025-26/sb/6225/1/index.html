<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that it is necessary to provide a stable and dedicated source of funding for the preservation of the state's roads and transportation infrastructure to ensure the continued safety, functionality, and reliability of the transportation system.</p>
<p>The legislature intends that the proceeds of the sale of bonds in this act be used exclusively for the preservation of existing transportation facilities, including activities necessary to protect the state's investment in highway assets, extend the useful life of transportation structures, and maintain mobility for people and goods throughout the state of Washington.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>In order to provide funds necessary for the location, design, right-of-way, and construction of highway preservation projects or improvements and ferry vessel construction, there shall be issued and sold upon the request of the department of transportation a total of $3,400,000,000 of general obligation bonds of the state of Washington.</p>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<p>Upon the request of the department of transportation, as appropriate, the state finance committee shall supervise and provide for the issuance, sale, and retirement of the bonds in this act in accordance with chapter 39.42 RCW. Bonds authorized by this act shall be sold in the manner, at time or times, in amounts, and at the price as the state finance committee shall determine. No bonds may be offered for sale without prior legislative appropriation of the net proceeds of the sale of the bonds.</p>
<p>The state finance committee shall consider the issuance of short-term obligations in lieu of long-term obligations for the purposes of more favorable interest rates, lower total interest costs, and increased marketability and for the purpose of retiring the bonds during the life of the project for which they were issued.</p>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<p>The proceeds from the sale of bonds authorized by section 2 of this act shall be deposited in the preserve Washington account created in section 10 of this act.

The principal and interest on the bonds shall be first payable in the manner provided in this section and sections 2 through 4, 6, and 7 of this act from the proceeds of the state excise taxes on fuel imposed by chapter 82.38 RCW and vehicle-related fees imposed under Title 46 RCW that constitute license fees for motor vehicles required to be used for highway purposes. Proceeds of these excise taxes and vehicle-related fees are hereby pledged to the payment of any bonds and the interest thereon issued under the authority of this section and sections 2 through 4, 6, and 7 of this act, and the legislature agrees to continue to impose these excise taxes on fuel and vehicle-related fees in amounts from such sources sufficient to pay, when due, the principal and interest on all bonds issued under the authority of this section and sections 2 through 4, 6, and 7 of this act.</p>
