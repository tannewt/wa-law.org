<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Washington state legislature finds that because children are one of our state's most valuable resources and our future, it is of utmost importance to provide for their physical and emotional safety. In recent years, allegations of sexual abuse have soared, specifically against trusted adults. The legislature finds that there is a need to implement robust training, reporting, and background checks in addition to rigorous psychological screening processes before volunteers and employees interact with vulnerable populations. In its 2018 report, the Washington schools risk management pool reported unprecedented numbers of sexual abuse claims, but there is very little specific data. Therefore, the legislature recognizes there is a need for more data collection regarding sexual abuse of children in our state. The legislature intends to improve data collection by public institutions overseeing our school-age children, including educational service districts and the office of the superintendent of public instruction.</p>
<p>The legislature also intends that clergy be treated the same as other mandatory reporters, while acknowledging that religious practices and religious freedoms are protected by the Constitution of the United States. The legislature intends to respect church practices and sacred sacraments, including the sacrament of penance and reconciliation.</p>

<p>&quot;Family assessment&quot; means a comprehensive assessment of child safety, risk of subsequent child abuse or neglect, and family strengths and needs that is applied to a child abuse or neglect report.

</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Family assessment response&quot; means a way of responding to certain reports of child abuse or neglect made under this chapter using a differential response approach to child protective services. The family assessment response shall focus on the safety of the child, the integrity and preservation of the family, and shall assess the status of the child and the family in terms of risk of abuse and neglect including the parent's or guardian's or other caretaker's capacity and willingness to protect the child and, if necessary, plan and arrange the provision of services to reduce the risk and otherwise support the family.

When considering whether a clear and present danger exists, evidence of a parent's substance abuse as a contributing factor to negligent treatment or maltreatment shall be given great weight. The fact that siblings share a bedroom is not, in and of itself, negligent treatment or maltreatment. Poverty, experiencing homelessness, or exposure to domestic violence as defined in RCW 7.105.010 that is perpetrated against someone other than the child does not constitute negligent treatment or maltreatment in and of itself.</p>

<p>In conducting an investigation or family assessment of alleged abuse or neglect, the department or law enforcement agency:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>May interview children. If the department determines that the response to the allegation will be family assessment response, the preferred practice is to request a parent's, guardian's, or custodian's permission to interview the child before conducting the child interview unless doing so would compromise the safety of the child or the integrity of the assessment. The interviews may be conducted on school premises, at day-care facilities, at the child's home, or at other suitable locations outside of the presence of parents. If the allegation is investigated, parental notification of the interview must occur at the earliest possible point in the investigation that will not jeopardize the safety or protection of the child or the course of the investigation. Prior to commencing the interview the department or law enforcement agency shall determine whether the child wishes a third party to be present for the interview and, if so, shall make reasonable efforts to accommodate the child's wishes. Unless the child objects, the department or law enforcement agency shall make reasonable efforts to include a third party in any interview so long as the presence of the third party will not jeopardize the course of the investigation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shall have access to all relevant records of the child in the possession of mandated reporters and their employees.</p>

<li>
<p>If a report of alleged abuse or neglect is founded and constitutes the third founded report received by the department within the last twelve months involving the same child or family, the department shall promptly notify the office of the family and children's ombuds of the contents of the report. The department shall also notify the ombuds of the disposition of the report.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall use a risk assessment process when investigating alleged child abuse and neglect referrals. The department shall present the risk factors at all hearings in which the placement of a dependent child is an issue. Substance abuse must be a risk factor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon receipt of a report of alleged abuse or neglect the law enforcement agency may arrange to interview the person making the report and any collateral sources to determine if any malice is involved in the reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon receiving a report of alleged abuse or neglect involving a child under the court's jurisdiction under chapter 13.34 RCW, the department shall promptly notify the child's guardian ad litem of the report's contents.

</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall make efforts as soon as practicable to determine the military status of parents whose children are subject to abuse or neglect allegations. If the department determines that a parent or guardian is in the military, the department shall notify a department of defense family advocacy program that there is an allegation of abuse and neglect that is screened in and open for investigation that relates to that military parent or guardian.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall make available on its public website a downloadable and printable poster that includes the reporting requirements included in this section.
