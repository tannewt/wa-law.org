<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that grocery establishments are vital points of distribution for food and daily necessities across Washington. The closure of a grocery establishment can have widespread effects on a community's well-being by reducing access to food and creating food insecurity.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that food insecurity contributes to poor health and health disparities. Grocery establishment closures can have an especially dire impact on senior citizens, people with disabilities, and people who lack the means to travel by car or public transportation to grocery establishments located outside their neighborhood.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that in 2024 state law was amended to provide safeguards during the merger of certain grocery establishments until the employer provides written notice to the city council, county council, local health department, and attorney general 180 days before the closure.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes the value of advance knowledge of a closure in addition to mergers so a community can work with employers on alternatives to closure and sale to proprietors seeking to continue grocery service in a given location.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature resolves to create additional notice requirements and certain employer requirements to protect communities that rely on reasonable access to grocery establishments' products and services.</p>
