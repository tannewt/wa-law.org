<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the application of the business and occupation tax deduction provided in RCW 82.04.4281(1)(a) for investment income has once again become the subject of uncertainty as a result of the decision of the state supreme court in Antio, LLC v. Department of Revenue, which could lead to a restrictive, narrow interpretation of the deductibility of investment income for business and occupation tax purposes. The legislature intends, by adopting this revision to RCW 82.04.4281, to clarify and preserve the certainty and stability for taxpayers and the state that generally ensued following the adoption of chapter 250, Laws of 2002 in response to the decision of the state supreme court in Simpson Investment Co. v. Department of Revenue. The legislature intends, by adopting this clarifying revision of RCW 82.04.4281, to avoid uncertainty while continuing to treat similarly situated taxpayers fairly.</p>
