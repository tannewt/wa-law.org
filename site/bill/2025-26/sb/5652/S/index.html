<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Communities located near airports are uniquely and disproportionately exposed to aviation-related air pollution such as ultrafine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, volatile organic compounds, black carbon, and other pollutants. Those pollutants have been linked to breast cancer, heart disease, prostate cancer, and a variety of lung conditions, including asthma. Communities near airports are also disproportionately exposed to noise from aviation activity, which has been linked to increased levels of stress, sleep disruption, hypertension, and heart disease;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many building improvements, also known as port packages, such as double and triple-paned windows, insulation, and HVAC systems initially funded by the federal aviation administration and the Port of Seattle designed to mitigate the noise impacts of the airport activity have failed, resulting in unhealthy living conditions for nearby communities due to poor ventilation, leaking windows, moisture damage, mold growth, and structural rot; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A coordinated, evidence-based, community-informed approach is needed to comprehensively address air and noise impacts from aviation activity on these disproportionately affected communities. Moreover, community participation is essential to identifying effective mitigation strategies and developing an implementation framework to remediate past, and mitigate current, cumulative, and future, air and noise pollution impacts on these communities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Establish partnerships among local jurisdictions, state agencies, research institutions, and community members to develop scientifically sound, locally responsive strategies to mitigate the ongoing and cumulative impacts of aviation activity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish a grant program to:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Support the ongoing implementation of identified mitigation strategies to address the cumulative impacts of aviation activity on human and environmental health; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Address deficiencies in port packages funded by the federal aviation administration and the Port of Seattle; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Direct the office of the state auditor to complete an assessment of the steps the Port of Seattle has taken to evaluate the success of the port packages, identify related expenditures, evaluate homeowner satisfaction, and make recommendations for future action.</p>
</li>
