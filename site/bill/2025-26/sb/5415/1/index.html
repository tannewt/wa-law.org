<p>If the department contracts with any individual providers for personal care services, funding will be determined in accordance with the following process:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Upon meeting the requirements of subsection (2) of this section, the governor must submit, as a part of the proposed biennial or supplemental operating budget submitted to the legislature under RCW 43.88.030, a request for funds necessary to administer in-home care programs under this chapter and to implement the compensation and fringe benefits provisions of a collective bargaining agreement entered into under RCW 74.39A.270 or for legislation necessary to implement such agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A request for funds necessary to implement the compensation and fringe benefits provisions of a collective bargaining agreement entered into under RCW 74.39A.270 shall not be submitted by the governor to the legislature unless such request:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Has been submitted to the director of financial management by October 1st prior to the legislative session at which the request is to be considered; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has been certified by the director of financial management as being feasible financially for the state or reflects the binding decision of an arbitrator reached under RCW 74.39A.270(2)(c).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The director of the office of financial management shall not certify as financially feasible any collective bargaining agreement under subsection (2)(b) of this section if the governor's budget document or any appendix to a budget or budget document submitted under RCW 43.88.030 and 43.88.060 proposes to:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Fund expenditures by raising taxes; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Withdraw and appropriate funds from the budget stabilization account that requires a favorable vote of at least three-fifths of the members of each house of the legislature.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this subsection, &quot;raising taxes&quot; means any action or combination of actions by the state legislature that increases state tax revenue deposited in any fund, budget, or account, regardless of whether the revenues are deposited into the general fund.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature must approve or reject the submission of the request for funds as a whole. If the legislature rejects or fails to act on the submission, any such agreement will be reopened solely for the purpose of renegotiating the funds necessary to implement the agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When any increase in individual provider wages or benefits is negotiated or agreed to, no increase in wages or benefits negotiated or agreed to under this chapter will take effect unless and until, before its implementation, the department has determined that the increase is consistent with federal law and federal financial participation in the provision of services under Title XIX of the federal social security act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The governor shall periodically consult with the joint committee on employment relations established by RCW 41.80.010 regarding appropriations necessary to implement the compensation and fringe benefits provisions of any collective bargaining agreement and, upon completion of negotiations, advise the committee on the elements of the agreement and on any legislation necessary to implement such agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the expiration date of any collective bargaining agreement entered into under RCW 74.39A.270, all of the terms and conditions specified in any such agreement remain in effect until the effective date of a subsequent agreement, not to exceed one year from the expiration date stated in the agreement, except as provided in RCW 74.39A.270.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If, after the compensation and benefit provisions of an agreement are approved by the legislature, a significant revenue shortfall occurs resulting in reduced appropriations, as declared by proclamation of the governor or by resolution of the legislature, both parties shall immediately enter into collective bargaining for a mutually agreed upon modification of the agreement.</p>

<p>If the department contracts with a consumer directed employer:</p>

<li>
<p>In addition to overtime and compensable travel time set forth in RCW 74.39A.525, the initial labor rates shall be paid as described in the most recent collective bargaining agreement between the governor and the service employees international union 775, plus the hourly roll-up costs of any additional legally required benefits or labor costs, until subsequent rates can be established in accordance with this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A rate-setting board is established which is comprised of the voting members and nonvoting members to evaluate and propose changes in the rates paid to the consumer directed employer.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning in the year following the establishment of the initial rate under subsection (1) of this section, and in every even-numbered year thereafter, the rate-setting board shall attempt to determine a proposed labor rate, including a specific amount for health benefits by considering the factors listed in RCW 41.56.465 (1) and (5). In addition, the rate-setting board shall attempt to determine an administrative rate for the consumer directed employer.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the board's rate-setting activities, the voting members must first attempt to select an additional voting member, who will chair the rate-setting board and will cast a tie-breaking vote if the voting members identified in subsection (2) of this section are unable to pass by majority vote on the labor rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the first occasion that the voting members identified in subsection (2)(a) of this section fail to select a tie-breaking member by a majority vote, the chair member will be selected as follows:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The voting member representing the governor's office shall request a list of five qualified arbitrators, or six if there are two consumer directed employers, from the federal mediation and conciliation service.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The name of the arbitrator remaining after the final strike shall be the chair member of the board.</p>

<p>On each successive occasion that the voting members identified in subsection (2)(a) of this section fail to select a chair member by a majority vote, the order of voting members striking names from the list will continue to alternate between the order described in (b)(ii) and (c) of this subsection.</p>

<p>If an agreement on a proposed labor rate, an administrative rate, or both, is not reached by a majority of the voting members of the rate-setting board prior to July 1st, then:</p>
