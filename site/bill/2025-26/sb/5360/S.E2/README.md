# SB 5360 - Environmental crimes

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5360-S.E2.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. Washington is a state of great beauty and natural resources. It is vital to preserve these resources to ensure that future generations can benefit and enjoy the state's abundance. Washington has long been a national and international leader in environmental stewardship, including air and water quality protection and natural resource conservation. It is the objective of the legislature to maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the state's water, air, and other natural resources to protect human health and the environment for all Washingtonians.

    b. Washington is home to a rich and diverse economy including aerospace, construction, farming, fishing, logging, manufacturing, mining, ranching, technology, and many other industries. These industries drive Washington's vibrant economy and have helped improve the quality of life for many in Washington. Washingtonians and our businesses care deeply about the state's environment and work hard to comply with environmental regulations to ensure a safe and sustainable environment. It is vital to the future of Washington to continue to have robust agricultural and industrial sectors to promote prosperity for all Washingtonians.

    c. Environmental violations can cause significant harm to human health and the environment that can last for generations. Effective enforcement of environmental laws includes criminal enforcement for the most egregious violations of environmental statutes and regulations. The availability of criminal enforcement of environmental laws deters bad actors because environmental crimes are often deliberately committed to enhance profit, avoid cost, or achieve a competitive advantage against businesses that follow environmental laws and regulations.

2. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to prohibit acts that are completed knowingly or represent a gross deviation from a reasonable standard of care and not to penalize accidents or mistakes that occur in the normal course of business through no fault of an operator.

## Section 2

Every notice of violation shall offer to the alleged violator an opportunity to meet with the local air authority prior to the commencement of enforcement action.

## Section 20

2. Permits for energy facilities subject to chapter 80.50 RCW shall be issued by the energy facility site evaluation council.
