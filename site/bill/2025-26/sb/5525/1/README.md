    b. An employer who has previously announced and carried out a short-term mass layoff of three months or less that is extended beyond three months due to business circumstances not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the initial mass layoff is required to give notice when it becomes reasonably foreseeable that the extension is required. A mass layoff extending beyond three months from the date the mass layoff commenced for any other reason must be treated as an employment loss from the date of commencement of the initial mass layoff.

    c. In the case of the sale of part or all of a business, the seller is responsible for providing notice of any business closing or mass layoff which will take place up to and on the effective date of the sale.

        ii. The capital or business sought, if obtained, would have enabled the employer to avoid or postpone the business closing or mass layoff; and

        iii. The employer reasonably and in good faith believed that giving the notice required by section 2 of this act would have precluded the employer from obtaining the needed capital or business;

    b. The mass layoff or business closing is caused by business circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable at the time the notice would have been required. The unforeseeable business circumstances must be caused by a sudden, dramatic, and unexpected action or condition outside of the employer's control; or

        i. The average regular rate of compensation received by the employee during the last three years of the employee's employment; or

        ii. The employee's final rate of compensation; and

    b. The value of the cost of any benefits to which the employee would have been entitled had their employment not been lost, including the cost of any medical expenses incurred by the employee that would have been covered under an employee benefit plan.

    a. The department, an aggrieved employee, or the bargaining representative of the aggrieved employee may bring a civil action on behalf of the person, other persons similarly situated, or both, in any court of competent jurisdiction within three years of the alleged violation. The court may award reasonable attorneys' fees as part of costs to any plaintiff who prevails in a civil action brought under this chapter.

    b. If the court determines that an employer conducted a reasonable investigation in good faith and had reasonable grounds to believe that its conduct was not a violation of this chapter, the court may reduce the amount of any penalty it would otherwise impose against the employer under this chapter.

However, the employer is not subject to a civil penalty under this section if the employer pays to all applicable employees the amounts for which the employer is liable under section 4 of this act within three weeks from the date the employer orders the mass layoff, relocation, or termination.

2. Any civil penalty paid by the employer under the federal worker adjustment and retraining notification act, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2101 et seq., must be considered a payment of the civil penalty under this section.

3. All penalties recovered under this section must be paid into the state treasury and credited to the general fund.

## Section 6
1. When a mass layoff or business closing occurs, the employer must pay in full for the continuation of existing group health insurance, no matter where the group policy was written, issued, or delivered, for each employee experiencing employment loss as a result of the business closing or mass layoff and their dependents, if covered under the group policy, from the date of the business closing or employee's layoff for a period of 120 days or until the employee becomes eligible for other group coverage, whichever is less.

2. The department may investigate alleged violations of this section and may, upon a finding that an employer has violated this section, issue a notice of violation and order a payment to the employee equal to the value of the cost of any benefits to which the employee would have been entitled, including the cost of any medical expenses incurred by the employee that would have been covered under an employee benefit plan. However, the department may not investigate an alleged violation occurring more than three years prior.

The commissioner shall conduct an administrative review in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW.

    d. The commissioner shall issue all final orders after appeal of the initial order. The final order of the commissioner is subject to judicial review in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW.
