<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>At the time the notice would have been required, the employer was actively seeking capital or business;</p>

<li>
<p>The mass layoff or business closing is caused by business circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable at the time the notice would have been required. The unforeseeable business circumstances must be caused by a sudden, dramatic, and unexpected action or condition outside of the employer's control;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mass layoff or business closing is due to a natural disaster, such as a flood, earthquake, drought, storm, tornado, or similar effects of nature; or</p>

</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The department, an aggrieved employee, or the bargaining representative of the aggrieved employee may bring a civil action on behalf of the person, other persons similarly situated, or both, in any court of competent jurisdiction within three years of the alleged violation.

</li>
<li>
<p>Any civil penalty paid by the employer under the federal worker adjustment and retraining notification act, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2101 et seq., must be considered a payment of the civil penalty under this section.</p>
