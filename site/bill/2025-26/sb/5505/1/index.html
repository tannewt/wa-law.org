<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A state universal communications services program is established. The program is established  under the authority of the state to regulate telecommunications under Article XII, section 19 of the state Constitution. The program is established to advance the development of statewide telecommunications infrastructure that is capable of supporting applications such as public safety, telemedicine, services for persons with special needs, distance learning, public library services, access to internet providers, and voice services to ensure access to 911 services. The purpose of the program is to support continued provision of basic telecommunications services under rates, terms, and conditions established by the commission and the provision, enhancement, and maintenance of broadband services, recognizing that, historically, the incumbent public network functions to provide all communications services including, but not limited to, voice and broadband services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the program, eligible communications providers may receive distributions from the universal communications services account created in RCW 80.36.690 in exchange for the affirmative agreement to provide continued telecommunications services under the rates, terms, and conditions established by the commission under this chapter, and broadband services, for the period covered by the distribution. The commission must implement and administer the program under terms and conditions established in RCW 80.36.630 through 80.36.690. Expenditures for the program may not exceed five million dollars per fiscal year; provided, however, that if less than five million dollars is expended in any fiscal year, the unexpended portion must be carried over to subsequent fiscal years and, unless fully expended, must be available for program expenditures in such subsequent fiscal years in addition to the five million dollars allotted for each of those subsequent fiscal years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Funds from the universal communications services account may be used for the following purposes:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>To provide and upgrade services in areas that do not meet the state's speed goals as defined in RCW 43.330.536;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>For the maintenance of existing telecommunications infrastructure; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For other purposes defined by the commission.</p>
</li>
</ol>
