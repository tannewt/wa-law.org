<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature with this act to expand consumer access to zero emissions vehicles by allowing direct sales from qualified zero emissions vehicle manufacturers, while ensuring that traditional auto dealers are supported in transitioning to a zero emissions vehicle-focused market, and to balance innovation with consumer protection and incentivize traditional auto dealers to increase zero emissions vehicle sales.</p>
<p>The legislature also intends to ensure fair protections and practices for motor vehicle dealers, recognizing their vital role in serving the needs of communities across the state. By establishing fair reimbursement terms for warranty work; restricting manufacturers' actions related to pricing, preorders, and subscription services; and ensuring that incentive programs have reasonable conditions, the legislature seeks to promote equitable and transparent relationships between manufacturers and dealers.</p>

<h2 id="section-10">Section 10 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-10">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds and declares that the distribution and sale of motor vehicles in this state vitally affect the general economy of the state and the public interest and public welfare, that provision for warranty service to motor vehicles is of substantial concern to the people of this state, that the maintenance of fair competition among dealers and others is in the public interest, and that the maintenance of strong and sound dealerships is essential to provide continuing and necessary reliable services to the consuming public in this state and to provide stable employment to the citizens of this state. The legislature further finds that there is a substantial disparity in bargaining power between automobile manufacturers and their dealers, and that in order to promote the public interest and the public welfare, and in the exercise of its police power, it is necessary to regulate the relationship between motor vehicle dealers and motor vehicle manufacturers, importers, distributors, and their representatives doing business in this state, not only for the protection of dealers but also for the benefit of the public in assuring the continued availability and servicing of automobiles sold to the public.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes it is in the best interest for manufacturers and dealers of motor vehicles to conduct business with each other in a fair, efficient, and competitive manner. The legislature declares the public interest is best served by dealers being assured of the ability to manage their business enterprises under a contractual obligation with manufacturers where dealers do not experience unreasonable interference and are assured of the ability to transfer ownership of their business without undue constraints. It is the intent of the legislature to impose a regulatory scheme and to regulate competition in the motor vehicle industry to the extent necessary to balance fairness and efficiency. These actions will permit motor vehicle dealers to better serve consumers , devote their best competitive efforts and resources to the sale and service of the manufacturer's products to consumers, and provide fair compensation for work performed in all departments of the business.</p>
<h2 id="section-11">Section 11 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-11">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Each manufacturer shall specify in its franchise agreement, or in a separate written agreement, with each of its dealers licensed in this state, the dealer's obligation to perform warranty work or service on the manufacturer's products. Each manufacturer shall provide each of its dealers with a schedule of compensation to be paid to the dealer for any warranty work or service, including parts, labor, and diagnostic work, required of the dealer by the manufacturer in connection with the manufacturer's products. The schedule of compensation must not be less than the rates charged by the dealer for similar service to retail customers for nonwarranty service and repairs, and must not be less than the schedule of compensation for an existing dealer as of June 10, 2010.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The rates charged by the dealer for nonwarranty service or work for parts means the price paid by the dealer for those parts, including all shipping and other charges, increased by the franchisee's average percentage markup. If a manufacturer or distributor furnishes or arranges the order or distribution of a part or component to a new motor vehicle dealer at no or reduced cost to use in performing repairs, the manufacturer or distributor shall compensate the dealer for the part or component in the same manner as warranty parts compensation under this section by compensating the dealer the retail parts rate on the wholesale cost for the part or component as listed in the manufacturer's or distributor's price schedule, minus the wholesale cost for the part or component. A manufacturer shall not establish or implement a special part or component number for parts used in predelivery, dealer preparation, warranty, service contract, certified preowned warranty, recall, campaign service, authorized goodwill, or maintenance-only applications if it results in lower compensation to the dealer than as calculated in this section. A dealer must establish and declare the dealer's average percentage markup by submitting to the manufacturer 100 sequential customer-paid service repair orders or ninety days of customer-paid service repair orders, whichever is less, covering repairs made no more than 180 days before the submission. A change in a dealer's established average percentage markup takes effect 30 days following the submission. A manufacturer may not require a dealer to establish average percentage markup by another methodology. A manufacturer may not require information that the dealer believes is unduly burdensome or time-consuming to provide, including, but not limited to, part-by-part or transaction-by-transaction calculations. In calculating the retail rate customarily charged by the dealer for parts and labor, the following work must not be included in the calculation:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Repairs for manufacturer or distributor special events, specials, or promotional discounts for retail customer repairs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parts sold at wholesale or at reduced or specially negotiated rates for insurance repairs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Routine maintenance not covered under warranty, such as fluids, filters, and belts not provided in the course of repairs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nuts, bolts, fasteners, and similar items that do not have an individual part number;</p>

</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a" start="2">
<li>
<p>A manufacturer shall compensate a dealer for labor and diagnostic work at a rate determined by dividing the total customer labor charges for qualifying nonwarranty repairs in the repair orders submitted under this section by the total number of hours that would be allowed for the repairs if the repairs were made under the manufacturer's, importer's, or distributor's time allowances used in compensating the dealer for warranty work and for any documentation work required by the manufacturer to authorize or verify the work including, but not limited to, photographs, paperwork, and electronic data entry. However, a manufacturer is not required to compensate a dealer more than once for the same documentation work. If a manufacturer can demonstrate that the rates unreasonably exceed those of all other franchised motor vehicle dealers in the same relevant market area offering the same or a competitive motor vehicle line, the manufacturer is not required to honor the rate increase proposed by the dealer. If the manufacturer is not required to honor the rate increase proposed by the dealer, the dealer is entitled to resubmit a new proposed rate for labor and diagnostic work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A dealer may not be granted an increase in the average percentage markup or labor and diagnostic work rate more than once in one calendar year.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>All claims for warranty work for parts and labor made by dealers under this section must be submitted to the manufacturer within 90 days of the date the work was performed. All claims submitted must be paid by the manufacturer within 30 days following receipt, provided the claim has been approved by the manufacturer. The manufacturer has the right to audit claims for warranty work and to charge the dealer for any unsubstantiated, incorrect, or false claims for a period of nine months following payment. However, the manufacturer may audit and charge the dealer for any fraudulent claims during any period for which an action for fraud may be commenced under applicable state law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All claims submitted by dealers on the forms and in the manner specified by the manufacturer shall be either approved or disapproved within 30 days following their receipt. The manufacturer shall notify the dealer in writing of any disapproved claim, and shall set forth the reasons why the claim was not approved. Any claim not specifically disapproved in writing within 30 days following receipt is approved, and the manufacturer is required to pay that claim within 30 days of receipt of the claim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A manufacturer may not otherwise recover all or any portion of its costs for compensating its dealers licensed in this state for warranty parts and service either by reduction in the amount due to the dealer or by separate charge, surcharge, or other imposition.</p>

Coerce or attempt to coerce a motor vehicle dealer to refrain from, or prohibit or attempt to prohibit a new motor vehicle dealer from acquiring, owning, having an investment in, participating in the management of, or holding a franchise agreement for the sale or service of another make or line of new motor vehicles or related products, or establishing another make or line of new motor vehicles or service in the same dealership facilities, if the prohibition against acquiring, owning, investing, managing, or holding a franchise for such additional make or line of vehicles or products, or establishing another make or line of new motor vehicles or service in the same dealership facilities, is not supported by reasonable business considerations. The burden of proving that reasonable business considerations support or justify the prohibition against the additional make or line of new motor vehicles or products or nonexclusive facilities is on the manufacturer;

l. Require, by contract or otherwise, a new motor vehicle dealer to make a material alteration, expansion, or addition to any dealership facility, unless the required alteration, expansion, or addition is uniformly required of other similarly situated new motor vehicle dealers of the same make or line of vehicles and is reasonable in light of all existing circumstances, including economic conditions. In any proceeding in which a required facility alteration, expansion, or addition is an issue, the manufacturer or distributor has the burden of proof. Except for a program or any renewal or modification of a program that is in effect with one or more new motor vehicle dealers in this state on June 12, 2014, a manufacturer shall not require, coerce, or attempt to coerce any new motor vehicle dealer by program, policy, standard, or otherwise to change the location of the dealership or construct, replace, renovate, or make any substantial changes, alterations, or remodeling to a new motor vehicle dealer's sales or service facilities, except as necessary to comply with health or safety laws or to comply with technology requirements without which a dealer would be unable to service a vehicle the dealer has elected to sell, before the 10th anniversary of the date of issuance of the certificate of occupancy or the manufacturer's approval, whichever is later, from:

    i. The date construction of the dealership at that location was completed if the construction was in substantial compliance with standards or plans provided by a manufacturer, distributor, or representative or through a subsidiary or agent of the manufacturer, distributor, or representative; or

    ii. The date a prior change, alteration, or remodel of the dealership at that location was completed if the construction was in substantial compliance with standards or plans provided by a manufacturer, distributor, or representative or through a subsidiary or agent of the manufacturer, distributor, or representative;

m. Prevent or attempt to prevent by contract or otherwise any new motor vehicle dealer from changing the executive management of a new motor vehicle dealer unless the manufacturer or distributor, having the burden of proof, can show that a proposed change of executive management will result in executive management by a person or persons who are not of good moral character or who do not meet reasonable, preexisting, and equitably applied standards of the manufacturer or distributor. If a manufacturer or distributor rejects a proposed change in the executive management, the manufacturer or distributor shall give written notice of its reasons to the dealer within 60 days after receiving written notice from the dealer of the proposed change and all related information reasonably requested by the manufacturer or distributor, or the change in executive management must be considered approved;

n. Condition the sale, transfer, relocation, or renewal of a franchise agreement or condition manufacturer, distributor, factory branch, or factory representative sales, services, or parts incentives upon the manufacturer obtaining site control, including rights to purchase or lease the dealer's facility, or an agreement to make improvements or substantial renovations to a facility. For purposes of this section, a substantial renovation has a gross cost to the dealer in excess of $5,000;

o. Fail to provide to a new motor vehicle dealer purchasing or leasing building materials or other facility improvements the right to purchase or lease franchisor image elements of like kind and quality from an alternative vendor selected by the dealer if the goods or services are to be supplied by a vendor selected, identified, or designated by the manufacturer or distributor. If the vendor selected by the manufacturer or distributor is the only available vendor of like kind and quality materials, the new motor vehicle dealer must be given the opportunity to purchase the franchisor image elements at a price substantially similar to the capitalized lease costs of the elements. This subsection (1)(o) must not be construed to allow a new motor vehicle dealer or vendor to gain additional intellectual property rights they are not otherwise entitled to or to impair or eliminate the intellectual property rights of the manufacturer or distributor or to permit a new motor vehicle dealer to erect or maintain signs that do not conform to the reasonable intellectual property usage guidelines of the manufacturer or distributor;

p. Take any adverse action against a new motor vehicle dealer including, but not limited to, charge backs or reducing vehicle allocations, for sales and service performance within a designated area of primary responsibility unless that area is reasonable in light of proximity to relevant census tracts to the dealership and competing dealerships, highways and road networks, any natural or man-made barriers, demographics, including economic factors, buyer behavior information, and contains only areas inside the state of Washington unless specifically approved by the new motor vehicle dealer;

q. Require, coerce, or attempt to coerce any new motor vehicle dealer by program, policy, facility guide, standard, or otherwise to order or accept delivery of any service or repair appliances, equipment, parts, or accessories, or any other commodity not required by law, which the dealer has not voluntarily ordered or which the dealer does not have the right to return unused for a full refund within 90 days or a longer period as mutually agreed upon by the dealer and manufacturer;

r. Modify the franchise agreement for any new motor vehicle dealer unless the manufacturer notifies the dealer in writing of its intention to modify the agreement at least 90 days before the effective date thereof, stating the specific grounds for the modification, and undertakes the modification in good faith, for good cause, and in a manner that would not adversely and substantially alter the rights, obligations, investment, or return on investment of the franchised new motor vehicle dealer under the existing agreement; or

s. Implement a program or policy that encourages or requires the franchisee to install direct current fast charging stations, unless all of the following are satisfied:

    i. If the program or policy requires public access to the direct current fast charging stations, the franchisor shall reimburse the dealer for one-half of the cost to install and maintain the stations if the dealer pays the franchisor half of the net income generated from the ongoing use of the stations;

    ii. The program or policy may not encourage or require the franchisee to install direct current fast charging stations at its dealership location if the franchisee can obtain access to direct current fast charging stations that satisfy the program or policy within a reasonable distance, with a minimum of five miles, of the franchisee's dealership location;

    iii. The program or policy must be reasonable in light of all existing circumstances including, but not limited to, local conditions, supply constraints, time constraints, advancements in vehicular technology, and electric grid integration; and

    iv. The program or policy must allow a new motor vehicle dealer the right to purchase or lease goods or services of like kind and quality from an alternative vendor selected by the dealer if the goods or services are to be supplied by a vendor selected, identified, or designated by the manufacturer or distributor.
