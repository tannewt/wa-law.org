# SB 5296 - Juvenile offenses

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5296-S2.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The standard range disposition for a juvenile adjudicated of an offense is determined according to RCW 13.40.0357 and this section.

    a. When the court sentences an offender to a local sanction as provided in RCW 13.40.0357 option A, the court shall impose a determinate disposition within the standard ranges, except as provided in subsections (2)through (5) of this section. The disposition may be comprised of one or more local sanctions.

    b. When the court sentences an offender to a standard range as provided in RCW 13.40.0357 option A that includes a term of confinement exceeding 30 days, commitment shall be to the department for the standard range of confinement, except as provided in subsections (2)through (5) of this section for offenses listed in RCW 13.04.030(1)(e)(v).

    c. Except for offenses listed in RCW 13.04.030(1)(e)(v), before the court sentences an offender to a standard range as provided in RCW 13.40.0357 option A that includes a term of confinement exceeding 30 days, the court shall make an independent finding, supported by clear and convincing evidence, that commitment to the department is needed because a community-based placement would not adequately protect the community. A stipulation by the parties alone is not sufficient to support an independent finding that commitment to the department is needed under this subsection. Commitment of a juvenile to confinement over 30 days must be to the department for the standard range of confinement, except as provided in this subsection and subsections (2) through (5) of this section.

    d. In making a finding under (c) of this subsection, the court shall consider the following factors:

        i. The severity of the offense or offenses for which the juvenile has most recently been adjudicated, including the juvenile's role in the offense, the juvenile's behavior, and harm done to victims;

        ii. The juvenile's criminal history, including the adequacy and success of previous attempts by the juvenile court to rehabilitate the juvenile;

        iii. Whether the programming, treatment, and education offered and provided in a juvenile rehabilitation facility is appropriate to meet the treatment and security needs of the juvenile;

        iv. Whether the goals of rehabilitation and community safety can be met by assigning the juvenile to a less restrictive disposition that is available to the court; and

    v. The juvenile's age, developmental maturity, mental and emotional health, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and any disabilities or special needs impacting the safety or suitability of committing the juvenile to a term of confinement in juvenile court.

    e. If the court does not make a finding under (c) of this subsection that commitment to the department is needed, the court may impose one or more local sanctions, in addition to a determinate sentence of electronic monitoring for up to the minimum of the juvenile's standard range while on community supervision. The court may also impose a suspended disposition.

    f. If the court does make a finding under (c) of this subsection, the court must maintain concurrent jurisdiction with the department over the juvenile, except the court's concurrent jurisdiction may be only for the purposes of conducting the review hearings described under RCW 13.40.185(3), and any community supervision that is ordered if a juvenile is released at the review hearing.

    g. If a juvenile is sentenced to a determinate sentence of electronic monitoring for up to the minimum of the juvenile's standard range under (e) of this subsection, and is found by the court to have violated any terms of an electronic monitoring agreement, the court may impose a sanction pursuant to RCW 13.40.200, or if the court makes a finding under RCW 13.40.160(1)(c), revoke the electronic monitoring and order confinement for up to the remainder of the determinate electronic monitoring sentence previously imposed. Upon completion of a sanction, the juvenile may resume electronic monitoring. Any time served in detention due to a violation of the terms of an electronic monitoring agreement shall be applied as credit for time served for the remaining time on electronic monitoring, or if revoked, confinement.

2. If the court concludes, and enters reasons for its conclusion, that disposition within the standard range would effectuate a manifest injustice the court shall impose a disposition outside the standard range, as indicated in option D of RCW 13.40.0357. The court's finding of manifest injustice shall be supported by clear and convincing evidence.

A disposition outside the standard range shall be determinate, subject to RCW 13.40.185(3), and shall be comprised of confinement or community supervision, or a combination thereof. When a judge finds a manifest injustice and imposes a sentence of confinement exceeding 30 days, the court shall sentence the juvenile to a maximum term, and the provisions of RCW 13.40.030(2) shall be used to determine the range. A disposition outside the standard range is appealable under RCW 13.40.230 by the state or the respondent. A disposition with a term of confinement that is 30 days or less is not appealable under RCW 13.40.230. A disposition within the standard range for the offenses in subsection (1)(b) of this section is not appealable under RCW 13.40.230, but other dispositions, including revocations of suspended dispositions, with a term of confinement of more than 30 days are appealable under RCW 13.40.230.

3. If a juvenile offender is found to have committed a sex offense, other than a sex offense that is also a serious violent offense as defined by RCW 9.94A.030, and has no history of a prior sex offense, the court may impose the special sex offender disposition alternative under RCW 13.40.162.

4. The court may impose the disposition alternative under RCW 13.40.165 unless a juvenile has been adjudicated of an offense listed in RCW 13.04.030(1)(e)(v).

5.

RCW 13.40.193 shall govern the disposition of any juvenile adjudicated of possessing a firearm in violation of RCW 9.41.040(2)(a)(v) or any crime in which a special finding is entered that the juvenile was armed with a firearm.

6. RCW 13.40.308 shall govern the disposition of any juvenile adjudicated of theft of a motor vehicle as defined under RCW 9A.56.065, possession of a stolen motor vehicle as defined under RCW 9A.56.068, taking a motor vehicle without permission in the first degree under RCW 9A.56.070, and taking a motor vehicle without permission in the second degree under RCW 9A.56.075.

7. Whenever a juvenile offender is entitled to credit for time spent in detention prior to a dispositional order, the dispositional order shall specifically state the number of days of credit for time served.

8. Except as provided under subsections (3)through (5) of this section, or option B of RCW 13.40.0357, or RCW 13.40.127, the court shall not suspend or defer the imposition or the execution of the disposition.

9. In no case shall the term of confinement imposed by the court at disposition exceed that to which an adult could be subjected for the same offense.

## Section 2
1. The purpose of this disposition alternative is to ensure that successful treatment options to reduce recidivism are available to eligible youth, pursuant to RCW 71.24.615. It is also the purpose of the disposition alternative to assure that minors in need of substance use disorder, mental health, and/or co-occurring disorder treatment receive an appropriate continuum of culturally relevant care and treatment, including prevention and early intervention, self-directed care, parent-directed care, and residential treatment. To facilitate the continuum of care and treatment to minors in out-of-home placements, all divisions of the department that provide these services to minors shall jointly plan and deliver these services. It is also the purpose of the disposition alternative to protect the rights of minors against needless hospitalization and deprivations of liberty and to enable treatment decisions to be made in response to clinical needs and in accordance with sound professional judgment. The mental health, substance abuse, and co-occurring disorder treatment providers shall, to the extent possible, offer services that involve minors' parents, guardians, and family.

2. The court must consider eligibility for the substance use disorder or mental health disposition alternative when a juvenile offender is subject to a standard range disposition  and has not committed an offense under RCW 13.04.030(1)(e)(v). The court, on its own motion or the motion of the state or the respondent if the evidence shows that the offender may be chemically dependent, substance abusing, or has significant mental health or co-occurring disorders may order an examination by a substance use disorder counselor from a substance use disorder treatment facility approved under chapter 70.96A RCW or a mental health professional as defined in chapter 71.34 RCW to determine if the youth is chemically dependent, substance abusing, or suffers from significant mental health or co-occurring disorders. The state shall pay the cost of any examination ordered under this subsection unless third-party insurance coverage is available.

3. The report of the examination shall include at a minimum the following: The respondent's version of the facts and the official version of the facts, the respondent's offense history, an assessment of drug-alcohol problems, mental health diagnoses, previous treatment attempts, the respondent's social, educational, and employment situation, and other evaluation measures used. The report shall set forth the sources of the examiner's information.

4. The examiner shall assess and report regarding the respondent's relative risk to the community. A proposed treatment plan shall be provided and shall include, at a minimum:

    a. Whether inpatient and/or outpatient treatment is recommended;

    b. Availability of appropriate treatment;

    c. Monitoring plans, including any requirements regarding living conditions, lifestyle requirements, and monitoring by family members, legal guardians, or others;

    d. Anticipated length of treatment; and

    e. Recommended crime-related prohibitions.

5. The court on its own motion may order, or on a motion by the state or the respondent shall order, a second examination. The evaluator shall be selected by the party making the motion. The requesting party shall pay the cost of any examination ordered under this subsection unless the requesting party is the offender, in which case the state shall pay the cost if no third-party insurance coverage is available.

6. [Empty]

    a. After receipt of reports of the examination, the court shall then consider whether the offender and the community will benefit from use of this disposition alternative and consider the victim's opinion whether the offender should receive a treatment disposition under this section.

    b. If the court determines that this disposition alternative is appropriate, then the court shall impose the standard range for the offense, or if the court concludes, and enters reasons for its conclusion, that such disposition would effectuate a manifest injustice, the court shall impose a disposition above the standard range as indicated in option D of RCW 13.40.0357 if the disposition is an increase from the standard range and the confinement of the offender does not exceed a maximum of 52 weeks, suspend execution of the disposition, and place the offender on community supervision for up to one year. As a condition of the suspended disposition, the court shall require the offender to undergo available outpatient drug/alcohol, mental health, or co-occurring disorder treatment and/or inpatient mental health or drug/alcohol treatment. The court shall only order inpatient treatment under this section if a funded bed is available. If the inpatient treatment is longer than 90 days, the court shall hold a review hearing every 30 days beyond the initial 90 days. The respondent may appear telephonically at these review hearings if in compliance with treatment. As a condition of the suspended disposition, the court may impose conditions of community supervision and other sanctions, including up to 30 days of confinement, 150 hours of community restitution, and payment of restitution.

7. The mental health/co-occurring disorder/drug/alcohol treatment provider shall submit monthly reports on the respondent's progress in treatment to the court and the parties. The reports shall reference the treatment plan and include at a minimum the following: Dates of attendance, respondent's compliance with requirements, treatment activities, the respondent's relative progress in treatment, and any other material specified by the court at the time of the disposition.

At the time of the disposition, the court may set treatment review hearings as the court considers appropriate.

If the offender violates any condition of the disposition or the court finds that the respondent is failing to make satisfactory progress in treatment, the court may impose sanctions pursuant to RCW 13.40.200 or, if the court makes a finding under RCW 13.40.160(1)(c), revoke the suspension and order execution of the disposition. The court shall give credit for any confinement time previously served if that confinement was for the offense for which the suspension is being revoked.

8. For purposes of this section, "victim" means any person who has sustained emotional, psychological, physical, or financial injury to person or property as a direct result of the offense charged. "Victim" may also include a known parent or guardian of a victim who is a minor child or is not a minor child but is incapacitated, incompetent, disabled, or deceased.

9. Whenever a juvenile offender is entitled to credit for time spent in detention prior to a dispositional order, the dispositional order shall specifically state the number of days of credit for time served.

10. In no case shall the term of confinement imposed by the court at disposition exceed that to which an adult could be subjected for the same offense.

11. A disposition under this section is not appealable under RCW 13.40.230, unless the court revokes the suspended disposition and makes a finding under RCW 13.40.160(1)(c).

12. Subject to funds appropriated for this specific purpose, the costs incurred by the juvenile courts for the mental health, substance use disorder, and/or co-occurring disorder evaluations, treatment, and costs of supervision required under this section shall be paid by the health care authority.

13. A juvenile, or the parent, guardian, or other person having custody of the juvenile shall not be required to pay the cost of any evaluation or treatment ordered under this section.

## Section 3
1. Except as provided under RCW 13.40.160(1)(e), any term of confinement imposed for an offense which exceeds 30 days shall be served under the supervision of the department, although the juvenile court maintains concurrent jurisdiction with the department over the juvenile, only for the purposes of conducting review hearings described under this section and any community supervision that is ordered if a juvenile is released at the review hearing. If the period of confinement imposed for more than one offense exceeds 30 days but the term imposed for each offense is less than 30 days or if the court orders electronic monitoring up to the minimum of the standard range under RCW 13.40.160(1)(e), the confinement may, in the discretion of the court, be served in a juvenile facility operated by or pursuant to a contract with the state or a county.

    a. The juvenile court administrator and the secretary of the department, or the secretary's designee, in alignment with the definition of confinement in RCW 13.40.020(7), shall prioritize capacity-related concerns related to the physical custody of the juvenile when establishing contractual agreements in efforts to provide a humane, safe, and rehabilitative environment.

    b. Subject to the availability of funds appropriated for this specific purpose, the department shall establish contractual agreements with at least four juvenile court administrators, including at least one that is located east of the Cascade mountains, for the confinement of youth in a juvenile facility with terms of confinement that are less than 90 days, as determined by RCW 13.40.210(1), and shall include costs associated with physical custody, treatment or relevant programming, medical costs, and any other costs associated with the confinement of the juvenile. Any existing contractual agreements as of January 1, 2025, created by the department and a juvenile court administrator to confine a juvenile locally pending transport of the youth to a juvenile rehabilitation facility after sentencing do not apply to this subsection (1)(b).

2. Whenever a juvenile is confined in a detention facility or is committed to the department, the court may not directly order a juvenile into a particular county or state facility. The juvenile court administrator and the secretary or the secretary's designee, as appropriate, has the sole discretion to determine in which facility a juvenile should be confined or committed. The counties may operate a variety of detention facilities as determined by the county legislative authority subject to available funds.

3. Excluding the offenses listed in RCW 13.04.030(1)(e)(v), the juvenile court maintains concurrent jurisdiction with the department over a juvenile who is committed to the department, except the court's concurrent jurisdiction may be only for the purposes of scheduling and conducting a review hearing at the mid-point of the minimum range, provided the review does not occur until after the juvenile has served at least four months in the custody of the department, and imposing any community supervision that is ordered if a juvenile is released at the review hearing. The court may schedule additional review hearings at its discretion.

    a. The department shall provide a report to the juvenile court at least 14 days before each review hearing detailing:

        i. The services received by the juvenile;

        ii. Any infractions committed by the juvenile;

        iii. How often the juvenile and the juvenile's family have had in-person visitation and video visits since the disposition hearing or the last review hearing, whichever is later; and

        iv. How often the juvenile has been under room confinement due to staffing issues or overpopulation and whether there have been any major disruptions to programming in the three months preceding the review hearing.

    b. During each review hearing the court shall consider the juvenile's progress and, unless the court makes a finding under RCW 13.40.160(1)(c), shall release the juvenile from the custody of the department and place the juvenile on up to a year of community supervision administered by the county, unless the juvenile will be placed on mandatory parole, in which case the juvenile shall be released to parole rather than community supervision.

    c. The prosecutor shall provide notice to the victim at least two weeks before each review hearing described under subsection (3) of this section, if the victim requests such notice be provided.

    d. The respondent shall appear remotely for the hearing described under subsection (3) of this section, unless ordered by the court to appear in person.

ADJUDICATIONS

NOTE: References in the grid to days or weeks mean periods of confinement. "LS" means "local sanctions" as defined in RCW 13.40.020.

1. The vertical axis of the grid is the current offense category. The current offense category is determined by the offense of adjudication.

2. The horizontal axis of the grid is the number of prior adjudications included in the juvenile's criminal history. Each prior felony adjudication shall count as one point. Each prior violation, misdemeanor, and gross misdemeanor adjudication shall count as 1/4 point. Fractional points shall be rounded down.

3. The standard range disposition for each offense is determined by the intersection of the column defined by the prior adjudications and the row defined by the current offense category.

4. RCW 13.40.180 applies if the offender is being sentenced for more than one offense.

5. A current offense that is a violation is equivalent to an offense category of E. However, a disposition for a violation shall not include confinement.

1. If the offender is subject to a standard range disposition involving confinement by the department, the court may impose the standard range and suspend the disposition on condition that the offender comply with one or more local sanctions and any educational or treatment requirement. The treatment programs provided to the offender must be either research-based best practice programs as identified by the Washington state institute for public policy or the joint legislative audit and review committee, or for chemical dependency treatment programs or services, they must be evidence-based or research-based best practice programs. For the purposes of this subsection:

    a. "Evidence-based" means a program or practice that has had multiple site random controlled trials across heterogeneous populations demonstrating that the program or practice is effective for the population; and

    b. "Research-based" means a program or practice that has some research demonstrating effectiveness, but that does not yet meet the standard of evidence-based practices.

2. If the offender fails to comply with the suspended disposition, the court may impose sanctions pursuant to RCW 13.40.200 or may revoke the suspended disposition and order the disposition's execution.

3. An offender is ineligible for the suspended disposition option under this section if the offender is adjudicated of

an offense under RCW 13.04.030(1)(e)(v) or a sex offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030

.

4. The court may revoke a suspended disposition only if the court makes a finding under RCW 13.40.160(1)(c). A revocation of a suspended disposition is appealable under RCW 13.40.230.

Unless a juvenile has been adjudicated of an offense under RCW 13.04.030(1)(e)(v), the court may impose a disposition under RCW 13.40.160(4) and 13.40.165. The court may revoke this disposition alternative only if the court makes a finding under RCW 13.40.160(1)(c).

If the court determines that a disposition under option A, B, or C would effectuate a manifest injustice, the court shall impose a disposition outside the standard range under RCW 13.40.160(2).

## Section 5
1. The department shall not initially place an offender in a community facility unless

the department has conducted a risk assessment, including a determination of drug and alcohol abuse, and the results indicate the juvenile will pose not more than a minimum risk to public safety

.

The risk assessment must include consideration of all prior convictions and all available nonconviction data released upon request under RCW 10.97.050, and any serious infractions or serious violations while under the jurisdiction of the secretary or the courts.

2.

A juvenile offender shall not be placed in a community facility until the department's risk assessment and security classification is complete .

## Section 6
1. The secretary shall set a release date for each juvenile committed to its custody and prioritize setting the release date as soon as possible for juveniles who would serve less than 90 days under the supervision of the department. The release date shall be within the prescribed range to which a juvenile has been committed under RCW 13.40.0357 or 13.40.030 except as provided in RCW 13.40.320 concerning offenders the department determines are eligible for the juvenile offender basic training camp program. Such dates shall be determined prior to the expiration of sixty percent of a juvenile's minimum term of confinement included within the prescribed range to which the juvenile has been committed. The secretary shall release any juvenile committed to the custody of the department within four calendar days prior to the juvenile's release date or on the release date set under this chapter. Days spent in the custody of the department shall be tolled by any period of time during which a juvenile has absented himself or herself from the department's supervision without the prior approval of the secretary or the secretary's designee.

2. The secretary shall monitor the average daily population of the state's juvenile residential facilities. When the secretary concludes that in-residence population of residential facilities exceeds one hundred five percent of the rated bed capacity specified in statute, or in absence of such specification, as specified by the department in rule, the secretary may recommend reductions to the governor. On certification by the governor that the recommended reductions are necessary, the secretary has authority to administratively release a sufficient number of offenders to reduce in-residence population to one hundred percent of rated bed capacity. The secretary shall release those offenders who have served the greatest proportion of their sentence. However, the secretary may deny release in a particular case at the request of an offender, or if the secretary finds that there is no responsible custodian, as determined by the department, to whom to release the offender, or if the release of the offender would pose a clear danger to society. The department shall notify the committing court of the release at the time of release if any such early releases have occurred as a result of excessive in-residence population. In no event shall an offender adjudicated of a violent offense be granted release under the provisions of this subsection.

3. [Empty]

    a. Following the release of any juvenile under subsection (1) of this section, the secretary may require the juvenile to comply with a program of parole to be administered by the department in his or her community which shall last no longer than eighteen months, except that in the case of a juvenile sentenced for a sex offense as defined under RCW 9.94A.030 the period of parole shall be twenty-four months and, in the discretion of the secretary, may be up to thirty-six months when the secretary finds that an additional period of parole is necessary and appropriate in the interests of public safety or to meet the ongoing needs of the juvenile. A parole program is mandatory for offenders released under subsection (2) of this section and for offenders who receive a juvenile residential commitment sentence for theft of a motor vehicle, possession of a stolen motor vehicle, or taking a motor vehicle without permission 1. A juvenile adjudicated for unlawful possession of a firearm, possession of a stolen firearm, theft of a firearm, or drive-by shooting may participate in aggression replacement training, functional family therapy, or functional family parole aftercare if the juvenile meets eligibility requirements for these services. The decision to place an offender in an evidence-based parole program shall be based on an assessment by the department of the offender's risk for reoffending upon release and an assessment of the ongoing treatment needs of the juvenile. The department shall prioritize available parole resources to provide supervision and services to offenders at moderate to high risk for reoffending.

    b. The secretary shall, for the period of parole, facilitate the juvenile's reintegration into his or her community and to further this goal shall require the juvenile to refrain from possessing a firearm or using a deadly weapon, and refrain from committing new offenses or violating any orders issued by the juvenile court pursuant to chapter 7.105 RCW, and may require the juvenile to: (i) Undergo available medical, psychiatric, drug and alcohol, sex offender, mental health, and other offense-related treatment services; (ii) report as directed to a parole officer and/or designee; (iii) pursue a course of study, vocational training, or employment; (iv) notify the parole officer of the current address where he or she resides; (v) be present at a particular address during specified hours; (vi) remain within prescribed geographical boundaries; (vii) submit to electronic monitoring; (viii) refrain from using illegal drugs and alcohol, and submit to random urinalysis when requested by the assigned parole officer; (ix) refrain from contact with specific individuals or a specified class of individuals; (x) meet other conditions determined by the parole officer to further enhance the juvenile's reintegration into the community; (xi) pay any court-ordered fines or restitution; and (xii) perform community restitution. Community restitution for the purpose of this section means compulsory service, without compensation, performed for the benefit of the community by the offender. Community restitution may be performed through public or private organizations or through work crews.

    c. The secretary may further require up to twenty-five percent of the highest risk juvenile offenders who are placed on parole to participate in an intensive supervision program. Offenders participating in an intensive supervision program shall be required to comply with all terms and conditions listed in (b) of this subsection and shall also be required to comply with the following additional terms and conditions: (i) Obey all laws and refrain from any conduct that threatens public safety; (ii) report at least once a week to an assigned community case manager; and (iii) meet all other requirements imposed by the community case manager related to participating in the intensive supervision program. As a part of the intensive supervision program, the secretary may require day reporting.

    d. After termination of the parole period, the juvenile shall be discharged from the department's supervision.

4. [Empty]

    a. The department may also modify parole for violation thereof. If, after affording a juvenile all of the due process rights to which he or she would be entitled if the juvenile were an adult, the secretary finds that a juvenile has violated a condition of his or her parole, the secretary shall order one of the following which is reasonably likely to effectuate the purpose of the parole and to protect the public: (i) Continued supervision under the same conditions previously imposed; (ii) intensified supervision with increased reporting requirements; (iii) additional conditions of supervision authorized by this chapter; (iv) except as provided in (a)(v) and (vi) of this subsection, imposition of a period of confinement not to exceed thirty days in a facility operated by or pursuant to a contract with the state of Washington or any city or county for a portion of each day or for a certain number of days each week with the balance of the days or weeks spent under supervision; (v) the secretary may order any of the conditions or may return the offender to confinement for the remainder of the sentence range if the offense for which the offender was sentenced is rape in the first or second degree, rape of a child in the first or second degree, child molestation in the first degree, indecent liberties with forcible compulsion, or a sex offense that is also a serious violent offense as defined by RCW 9.94A.030; and (vi) the secretary may order any of the conditions or may return the offender to confinement for the remainder of the sentence range if the youth has completed the basic training camp program as described in RCW 13.40.320.

    b. The secretary may modify parole and order any of the conditions or may return the offender to confinement for up to twenty-four weeks if the offender was sentenced for a sex offense as defined under RCW 9A.44.128 and is known to have violated the terms of parole. Confinement beyond thirty days is intended to only be used for a small and limited number of sex offenders. It shall only be used when other graduated sanctions or interventions have not been effective or the behavior is so egregious it warrants the use of the higher level intervention and the violation: (i) Is a known pattern of behavior consistent with a previous sex offense that puts the youth at high risk for reoffending sexually; (ii) consists of sexual behavior that is determined to be predatory as defined in RCW 71.09.020; or (iii) requires a review under chapter 71.09 RCW, due to a recent overt act. The total number of days of confinement for violations of parole conditions during the parole period shall not exceed the number of days provided by the maximum sentence imposed by the disposition for the underlying offense pursuant to RCW 13.40.0357. The department shall not aggregate multiple parole violations that occur prior to the parole revocation hearing and impose consecutive twenty-four week periods of confinement for each parole violation. The department is authorized to engage in rule making pursuant to chapter 34.05 RCW, to implement this subsection, including narrowly defining the behaviors that could lead to this higher level intervention.

    c. If the department finds that any juvenile in a program of parole has possessed a firearm or used a deadly weapon during the program of parole, the department shall modify the parole under (a) of this subsection and confine the juvenile for at least thirty days. Confinement shall be in a facility operated by or pursuant to a contract with the state or any county.

5. A parole officer of the department of children, youth, and families shall have the power to arrest a juvenile under his or her supervision on the same grounds as a law enforcement officer would be authorized to arrest the person.

6. If so requested and approved under chapter 13.06 RCW, the secretary shall permit a county or group of counties to perform functions under subsections (3) through (5) of this section.
