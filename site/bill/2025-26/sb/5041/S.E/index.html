<p>The individual is not participating in or financing or directly interested in the strike  that caused the individual's unemployment; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The individual does not belong to a grade or class of workers of which, immediately before the commencement of the strike , there were members employed at the premises at which the strike  occurs, any of whom are participating in or financing or directly interested in the strike : PROVIDED, That if in any case separate branches of work which are commonly conducted as separate businesses in separate premises are conducted in separate departments of the same premises, each such department shall, for the purpose of this subsection, be deemed to be a separate factory, establishment, or other premises.</p>

<p>Any disqualification imposed under this section shall end on the earlier of:</p>
