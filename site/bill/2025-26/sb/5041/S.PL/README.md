## Section 1
1. An individual shall be disqualified for benefits for any week with respect to which the commissioner finds that the individual's unemployment is

due to a strike at the factory, establishment, or other premises at which the individual is or was last employed

.

2. Subsection (1) of this section shall not apply if it is shown to the satisfaction of the commissioner that:

    a. The individual is not participating in or financing or directly interested in the strike  that caused the individual's unemployment; and

    b. The individual does not belong to a grade or class of workers of which, immediately before the commencement of the strike , there were members employed at the premises at which the strike  occurs, any of whom are participating in or financing or directly interested in the strike : PROVIDED, That if in any case separate branches of work which are commonly conducted as separate businesses in separate premises are conducted in separate departments of the same premises, each such department shall, for the purpose of this subsection, be deemed to be a separate factory, establishment, or other premises.

    a. Any disqualification imposed under this section shall end on the earlier of:

        i. The second Sunday following the first date of the strike, provided that the strike is not found to be prohibited by federal or state law in a final judgment. If a final judgment finds that a strike is prohibited by state or federal law, any benefits paid are liable for repayment as set forth in RCW 50.20.190; or

        ii. The date the strike  is terminated.

    b. When the disqualification ends, the individual is subject to the one week waiting period as provided in RCW 50.20.010 and any benefits must be calculated in accordance with this chapter. However, if an individual is unemployed due to a strike at the separating employer's factory, establishment, or other premises at which the individual is or was last employed, the individual may receive weekly benefits for no more than six calendar weeks, subject to other limitations provided in this title. Any weekly benefits received unrelated to the individual's unemployment due to a strike may not be counted toward the six calendar weeks.

4. If benefits are issued as a result of a strike under this section, the department shall notify the separating employer of the mediation services available through the public employment relations commission.

## Section 2
1. A determination of amount of benefits potentially payable issued pursuant to the provisions of RCW 50.20.120 and 50.20.140 shall not serve as a basis for appeal but shall be subject to request by the claimant for reconsideration and/or for redetermination by the commissioner at any time within one year from the date of delivery or mailing of such determination, or any redetermination thereof: PROVIDED, That in the absence of fraud or misrepresentation on the part of the claimant, any benefits paid prior to the date of any redetermination which reduces the amount of benefits payable shall not be subject to recovery under the provisions of RCW 50.20.190. A denial of a request to reconsider or a redetermination shall be furnished the claimant in writing and provide the basis for appeal under the provisions of RCW 50.32.020.

2.

3. A determination of allowance of benefits shall become final, in absence of a timely appeal therefrom: PROVIDED, That the commissioner may redetermine such allowance at any time within two years following the benefit year in which such allowance was made in order to recover any benefits improperly paid and for which recovery is provided under the provisions of RCW 50.20.190: AND PROVIDED FURTHER, That in the absence of fraud, misrepresentation, or nondisclosure, this provision or the provisions of RCW 50.20.190 shall not be construed so as to permit redetermination or recovery of an allowance of benefits which having been made after consideration of the provisions of RCW 50.20.010(1)(c), or the provisions of RCW 50.20.050, 50.20.060, or 50.20.080 has become final.

Written notice of any such redetermination shall be promptly given by mail or delivered to such interested parties as were notified of the initial determination or determination of denial or allowance of benefits and any new interested party or parties who, pursuant to such regulation as the commissioner may prescribe, would be an interested party.

    a. A contribution paying base year employer, except employers as provided in subsection (5) of this section, not otherwise eligible for relief of charges for benefits under this section, may receive such relief if the benefit charges result from payment to an individual who:

        i. Last left the employ of such employer voluntarily for reasons not attributable to the employer. In addition to other circumstances identified by the department by rule, an individual who leaves the employ of such employer under the circumstances described in RCW 50.20.050(1)(b) (iv) or (xi), (2)(b) (iv), (xi), or (xii), or (3) must be deemed to have left their employ for reasons not attributable to the employer;

This closure must be for reasons directly attributable to a catastrophic occurrence such as fire, flood, or other natural disaster, or to the presence of any dangerous, contagious, or infectious disease that is the subject of a public health emergency at the employer's plant, building, worksite, or other facility;

        iv. Continues to be employed by the employer seeking relief and: (A) The employer furnished part-time work to the individual during the base year; (B) the individual has become eligible for benefits because of loss of employment with one or more other employers; and (C) the employer has continued to furnish or make available part-time work to the individual in substantially the same amount as during the individual's base year. This subsection does not apply to shared work employers under chapter 50.60 RCW;

    v. Was hired to replace an employee who is a member of the military reserves or National Guard and was called to federal active military service by the president of the United States and is subsequently laid off when that employee is reemployed by their employer upon release from active duty within the time provided for reemployment in RCW 73.16.035;

    vi. Worked for an employer for 20 weeks or less, and was laid off at the end of temporary employment when that employee temporarily replaced a permanent employee receiving family or medical leave benefits under Title 50A RCW, and the layoff is due to the return of that permanent employee.

    vii. Was discharged because the individual was unable to satisfy a job prerequisite required by law or administrative rule.

    b. The employer requesting relief of charges under this subsection must request relief in writing within 30 days following mailing to the last known address of the notification of the valid initial determination of such claim, stating the date and reason for the separation or the circumstances of continued employment. The department may waive this time limitation for good cause. The commissioner, upon investigation of the request, shall determine whether relief should be granted.

4. When a benefit claim becomes invalid due to an amendment or adjustment of a report where the employer failed to report or inaccurately reported hours worked or remuneration paid, or both, all benefits paid will be charged to the experience rating account of the contribution paying employer or employers that originally filed the incomplete or inaccurate report or reports. An employer who reimburses the trust fund for benefits paid to workers and who fails to report or inaccurately reported hours worked or remuneration paid, or both, shall reimburse the trust fund for all benefits paid that are based on the originally filed incomplete or inaccurate report or reports.

5. An employer's experience rating account may not be relieved of charges for a benefit payment and an employer who reimburses the trust fund for benefit payments may not be credited for a benefit payment if a benefit payment was made because the employer or employer's agent failed to respond timely or adequately to a written request of the department for information relating to the claim or claims without establishing good cause for the failure and the employer or employer's agent has a pattern of such failures. The commissioner has the authority to determine whether the employer has good cause under this subsection.

    a. For the purposes of this subsection, "adequately" means providing accurate information of sufficient quantity and quality that would allow a reasonable person to determine whether an individual is eligible for or qualified to receive benefits.

    b. [Empty]

(A) At least three times in the previous two years; or

(B) Twenty percent of the total current claims against the employer.

        ii. If an employer's agent is utilized, a pattern is established based on each individual client employer that the employer's agent represents.

## Section 4
1. A qualified employer's contribution rate or array calculation factor rate determined under RCW 50.29.025 may be modified as follows:

    a. Subject to the limitations of this subsection, an employer may make a voluntary contribution of an amount equal to part or all of the benefits charged to the employer's account during the two years most recently ended on June 30th that were used for the purpose of computing the employer's contribution rate or array calculation factor rate. On receiving timely payment of a voluntary contribution, the commissioner shall cancel the benefits equal to the amount of the voluntary contribution and compute a new benefit ratio for the employer. The employer shall then be assigned the contribution rate or array calculation factor rate applicable for rate years beginning on or after January 1, 2005, applicable to the rate class within which the recomputed benefit ratio is included. The minimum amount of a voluntary contribution must be an amount that will result in a recomputed benefit ratio that is in a rate class at least two rate classes lower than the rate class that included the employer's original benefit ratio.

    b. Payment of a voluntary contribution is considered timely if received by the department during the period beginning on the date of mailing to the employer the notice of contribution rate required under this title for the rate year for which the employer is seeking a modification of the employer's rate and ending on March 1st of that rate year.

    c. A benefit ratio may not be recomputed nor a rate be reduced under this section as a result of a voluntary contribution received after the payment period prescribed in (b) of this subsection.

2. This section does not apply to any employer who has not had an increase of at least eight rate classes from the previous tax rate year.

3. If a contribution paying employer is charged benefits due to a strike under RCW 50.29.021, the department may:

    a. Evaluate whether the employer is eligible to make a voluntary contribution under this section; and

    b. Provide notice to eligible employers of the department's determination of the employer's eligibility to make a voluntary contribution.

## Section 5
1. If an individual receives benefits under this title while being unemployed due to a strike at the separating employer's factory, establishment, or other premises and the individual subsequently receives retroactive wages from the separating employer for any week for which he or she received benefits under this title, the department shall issue an overpayment assessment to recover the corresponding benefits as provided under RCW 50.20.190.

2. This section expires December 31, 2035.

## Section 6
If any part of this act is found to be in conflict with federal requirements that are a prescribed condition to the allocation of federal funds to the state or the eligibility of employers in this state for federal unemployment tax credits, the conflicting part of this act is inoperative solely to the extent of the conflict, and the finding or determination does not affect the operation of the remainder of this act. Rules adopted under this act must meet federal requirements that are a necessary condition to the receipt of federal funds by the state or the granting of federal unemployment tax credits to employers in this state.

    c. The sum totals of the information required in (a) of this subsection for each year in the 10 years prior to the effective date of this section as well as the sum of those 10 years.

2. This section expires January 1, 2036.

## Section 8
1. Where referral to publicly supported dispute resolution services through the federal mediation and conciliation service or other applicable federal agency is impracticable or where those services are unavailable due to federal staffing or funding reductions, the public employment relations commission may charge private sector employers and labor organizations a fee for covering the costs of services provided under this chapter.

2. Fees collected under this section must be deposited into the private sector labor dispute resolution account created in section 9 of this act.

## Section 9
The private sector labor dispute resolution account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. All fees collected under section 8 of this act must be deposited into the account. The executive director of the public employment relations commission may authorize expenditures from the account solely for the administration, staffing, and other related expenses of private sector labor dispute resolution services under this chapter. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures.
