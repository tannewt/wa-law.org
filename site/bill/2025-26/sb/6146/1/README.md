# SB 6146 - Preventive dental care

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6146.pdf)

## Section 1
1. It is the intent of the legislature to advance oral health equity, expand care availability, and ensure that children and families in Washington have meaningful access to basic preventive dental services. Washington families, especially children, continue to face barriers to timely oral health care, even though preventive care is essential to healthy development and long-term well-being.

2. The legislature finds that as federal policies continue to restrict pathways for internationally trained health professionals, Washington is embracing a more welcoming and pragmatic approach, recognizing that qualified providers strengthen our communities, and that Washington should not be held back by federal barriers that limit access to care.

3. The legislature recognizes that Washington faces a significant shortage of preventive care dental professionals, which limits access to basic preventive services in many communities. Oral preventive assistants and dentists trained internationally can play a crucial role in addressing these gaps. Creating clear pathways for these practitioners will help stabilize the workforce, expand service capacity across the state, and offer meaningful relief to families who currently struggle to secure timely oral health care.

## Section 2
The commission shall issue a license to practice as an oral preventive assistant to any applicant who:

1. Pays any applicable fees as established by the secretary in accordance with RCW 43.70.110 and 43.70.250;
