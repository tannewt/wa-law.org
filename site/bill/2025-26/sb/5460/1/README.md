## Section 3
1. It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to provide funding pursuant to section 1 of this act to the community preservation and development authorities, as created in this chapter, to promote and enhance the health, safety, and economic well-being of communities adversely impacted by the construction of, or on-going operation of, multiple major public facilities, public works, and capital projects. It is the intent of the legislature for the joint legislative audit and review committee to conduct a review of the funding and provide its findings to the legislature by December 1, 2034.

    b. Enhances the livability of the community by assisting in addressing the litter and debris in streets and alleys and provide remediation to address the impacts of homelessness; and

    c. Addresses housing needs, including funding new low-income and workforce housing units, as well as funding locally based street outreach to support interventions for unhoused residents.

3. In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (2) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may refer to any data collected by the state.

## Section 4
Any community preservation and development authority organized pursuant to this chapter must submit a biennial report to the appropriate committees of the legislature on their strategic plan, use of funding, and impacts on the community by November 1st of each odd-numbered year.
