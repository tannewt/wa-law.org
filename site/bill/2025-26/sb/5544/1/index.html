</li>
<li>
<p>The board may, within the constraints of available county local road trust account funds, consider additional projects for authorization upon a clear and conclusive showing by the submitting county that the proposed project is of an emergent nature and that its need was unable to be anticipated at the time the six-year program of the county was developed.
