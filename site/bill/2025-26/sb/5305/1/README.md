## Section 1
1. An environmental accelerator is established within the office to provide regulatory flexibility for salmon recovery and ecological resiliency projects and programs funded with climate commitment act revenue.

3. Any entity receiving funding for the primary purpose of salmon recovery and ecological resiliency from the climate investment account created in RCW 70A.65.250, the climate commitment account created in RCW 70A.65.260, the natural climate solutions account created in RCW 70A.65.270, or the air quality and health disparities improvement account created in RCW 70A.65.280 is automatically enrolled in the environmental accelerator.

4. The administrator must assist every entity in the environmental accelerator by:

    a. Assisting the entity with identifying any regulatory barriers to successfully and efficiently implementing the project or program for which the entity received funding;

    b. [Empty]

        i. Working with the relevant regulatory agency to see what, if any, regulatory relief may be granted to the entity by the regulatory agency;

        ii. Regulatory relief may be in the form of a waiver of state law or a waiver of a state rule for a trial period. The initial trial period may occur for up to five years and may be extended for the entity by a regulatory agency until the conclusion of the climate commitment act's compliance obligations for covered entities, as defined in RCW 70A.65.010; and

    c. When regulatory relief is granted to an entity, providing notice to all entities in the environmental accelerator of this relief. The office shall maintain a registry of enrollees so that those who wish to be notified for request of relief by other entities can update their contact information.

5. Entities enrolled in the environmental accelerator may request regulatory relief, on a form to be prescribed by the administrator of the environmental accelerator, and the relevant agency shall consider and respond to the request within 60 days.

6. [Empty]

    a. The administrator or the relevant regulatory agency may rescind a grant of regulatory relief if:

        i. The administrator or relevant regulatory agency determines the relief is no longer in the public interest; or

        ii. The program, project, or other qualifying grant has been terminated.

    b. When rescinding regulatory relief, the administrator or the relevant regulatory agency must provide the entity that received the relief with a detailed explanation of the reason for the rescission.

7. The office must provide a progress report on the environmental accelerator to the appropriate committees of the legislature by January 1st annually. The report must include:

    a. The number and type of entities requesting regulatory relief;

    b. A review and summary of the types of regulatory relief requested;

    c. The details of all regulatory relief granted by regulatory agencies;

    d. Recommendations or considerations for amending state law or rules to provide permanent regulatory relief; and

    e. Any other information that the department of commerce deems relevant and useful.

8. This section does not limit the authority of any regulatory agency to take any enforcement action, other than a civil penalty, authorized by law. This section does not limit a regulatory agency's authority to issue a civil penalty as authorized by law based upon a person's failure to comply with specific terms and conditions of any permit or license issued by the agency to that person.

9. If a regulatory agency determines that any part of this section is in conflict with federal law or program requirements, in conflict with federal requirements that are a prescribed condition to the allocation of federal funds to the state, or in conflict with the requirements for eligibility of employers in this state for federal unemployment tax credits, the conflicting part of this section is inoperative solely to the extent of the conflict. Any rules under this section must meet federal requirements that are a necessary condition to the receipt of federal funds by the state or the granting of federal unemployment tax credits to employers in this state.
