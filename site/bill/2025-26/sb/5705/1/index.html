<li>
<p>The driver of a motor vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard for the speed of such vehicles and the traffic upon and the condition of the highway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any second or subsequent violation of this subsection within a two-year period must be assessed a fine equal to double the base penalty assessed under RCW 46.63.110(3). The court may waive or remit such assessment, but for not less than the base penalty amount for a first violation.</p>
