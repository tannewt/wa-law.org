<ol>
<li>
<p>In 1987, as directed by the state health planning and resources development act, the state health coordinating council released the state health plan, which set forth objectives for the improvement of health status and development of health services in the state. The plan included recommendations on improving the health status of Washingtonians, improving access and quality of care, containing health care cost growth, and planning for long-term care needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2006, the legislature created the blue ribbon commission on health care costs and access. The commission was tasked with developing a five-year plan for substantially improving access to affordable health care for all Washington residents. In 2007, the legislature enacted several recommendations from the commission including directing the office of financial management to develop a statewide health resources strategy to establish statewide health planning policies and goals related to the availability of health care facilities and services, quality of care, and cost of care. Certificate of need determinations must be consistent with that strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2024, the legislature directed the department of health to conduct an analysis of the certificate of need program and report its findings and recommendations for statutory updates by June 30, 2025. Under this determination, the department must, at a minimum, consider other state approaches to certificates of need, impacts on access to care, cost control of health services, and equity, and approaches to identifying health care service needs at the statewide and community levels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to renew efforts to develop a sustainable state health plan and resource strategy by updating duties assigned to the office of financial management in chapter 43.370 RCW.</p>
