[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Passed%20Legislature/5568-S.PL.pdf)

## Section 1
1. In 1987, as directed by the state health planning and resources development act, the state health coordinating council released the state health plan, which set forth objectives for the improvement of health status and development of health services in the state. The plan included recommendations on improving the health status of Washingtonians, improving access and quality of care, containing health care cost growth, and planning for long-term care needs.

2. In 2006, the legislature created the blue ribbon commission on health care costs and access. The commission was tasked with developing a five-year plan for substantially improving access to affordable health care for all Washington residents. In 2007, the legislature enacted several recommendations from the commission including directing the office of financial management to develop a statewide health resources strategy to establish statewide health planning policies and goals related to the availability of health care facilities and services, quality of care, and cost of care. Certificate of need determinations must be consistent with that strategy.

3. In 2024, the legislature directed the department of health to conduct an analysis of the certificate of need program and report its findings and recommendations for statutory updates by June 30, 2025. Under this determination, the department must, at a minimum, consider other state approaches to certificates of need, impacts on access to care, cost control of health services, and equity, and approaches to identifying health care service needs at the statewide and community levels.

4. The legislature intends to renew efforts to develop a sustainable state health plan and resource strategy by updating duties assigned to the office of financial management in chapter 43.370 RCW.

## Section 4
1. The office , in coordination with relevant public and private stakeholders, shall update the state health plan by developing a statewide health resources strategy.

The strategy shall identify needs according to geographic regions suitable for comprehensive health planning as designated by the office.

    c. That a statewide health resources strategy should take into consideration the principles of health equity.

3. The strategy, with public input by health service areas, shall include:

    a. A health system assessment and objectives component that:

        i. Describes state and regional population demographics, health status indicators, and trends in health status and health care needs; and

    c. A health care data resource plan that identifies data elements necessary to properly conduct planning activities and to review certificate of need applications, including data related to inpatient and outpatient utilization and outcomes information, and financial and utilization information related to charity care, quality, and cost. The plan shall inventory existing data resources, both public and private, that store and disclose information relevant to the health planning process, including information necessary to conduct certificate of need activities pursuant to chapter 70.38 RCW. The plan shall identify any deficiencies in the inventory of existing data resources and the data necessary to conduct comprehensive health planning activities. The plan may recommend that the office be authorized to access existing data sources and conduct appropriate analyses of such data or that other agencies expand their data collection activities as statutory authority permits. The plan may identify any computing infrastructure deficiencies that impede the proper storage, transmission, and analysis of health planning data. The plan shall provide recommendations for increasing the availability of data related to health planning to provide greater community involvement in the health planning process and consistency in data used for certificate of need applications and determinations;

    d. An assessment of emerging trends in health care delivery and technology as they relate to access to health care facilities and services, quality of care, and costs of care. The assessment shall recommend any changes to the scope of health care facilities and services covered by the certificate of need program that may be warranted by these emerging trends. In addition, the assessment may recommend any changes to criteria used by the department to review certificate of need applications, as necessary;

    e. A rural health resource plan to assess the availability of health resources in rural areas of the state, assess the unmet needs of these communities, and evaluate how federal and state reimbursement policies can be modified, if necessary, to more efficiently and effectively meet the health care needs of rural communities. The plan shall consider the unique health care needs of rural communities, the adequacy of the rural health workforce, and transportation needs for accessing appropriate care.

4. The office shall submit a preliminary report outlining its work in developing a state health resources strategy by July 1, 2026. The office shall submit the completed health resources strategy report to the governor and the appropriate committees of the senate and house of representatives by December 31, 2027. The report must include projections and policy recommendations through 2032. Beginning January 1, 2033, the office shall report on strategy updates and implementation every four years .

The office shall hold at least one virtual or hybrid public hearing and allow opportunity to submit written comments prior to the issuance of the preliminary report outlining its work in developing the state health resources strategy and at least one virtual or hybrid public meeting before issuance of the completed health resources strategy report and any updated strategy reports.

## Section 5
The office shall submit the strategy to the department of health to direct its activities related to the certificate of need review program under chapter 70.38 RCW. As the health care facilities and services plan is updated for any specific geographic planning region, the office shall submit that plan to the department of health to direct its activities related to the certificate of need review program under chapter 70.38 RCW. The office shall not issue determinations of the merits of specific project proposals submitted by applicants for certificates of need. The department of health may not adopt rules in response to the strategy issued in 2027.
