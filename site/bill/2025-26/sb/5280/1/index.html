<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that there is burgeoning financial fraud involving victims who are induced to purchase virtual currency and then are persuaded to open themselves to the theft of this purchase by sophisticated fraud rings.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that the federal trade commission has reported that in 2023 it received more reports of imposter scams per million in population from Washington than from any other state, that scammers are increasingly convincing people to pay with virtual currency, and that virtual currency payments are difficult to trace and typically not reversible.</p>
<p>The legislature intends for this act, which protects consumers of virtual currency kiosks, to constitute an exercise of the state's police power to protect and promote the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the state in general. Accordingly, while this act is intended to protect the public generally, it is not intended to create a duty owed to any individual or entity on the part of the state.</p>
