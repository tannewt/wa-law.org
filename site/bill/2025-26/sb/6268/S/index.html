<li>
<p>Maintain an online record of all final decisions issued in response to special education community complaints. Each final decision must be available in an online format and accessible to the public at no charge for 20 years after the complaint is finalized. If, at the effective date of this section, the office of the superintendent of public instruction does not have a historical record of community complaint decisions from the prior 20 years, it must provide an online record of all final decisions for the longest period of time available; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promulgate such rules as are necessary to implement part B of the federal individuals with disabilities education improvement act or other federal law providing for special education services for children with disabilities and the several provisions of RCW 28A.150.390, 28A.160.030, and 28A.155.010 through 28A.155.160 and to ensure appropriate access to and participation in the general education curriculum and participation in statewide assessments for all students with disabilities.</p>
