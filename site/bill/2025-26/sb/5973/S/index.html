<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that the people have reserved for themselves the power to enact or reject legislation through the initiative and referendum process, as provided in Article II, section 1 of the state Constitution. The legislature determines that this constitutional right must be guarded against fraud and mistake and that reasonable procedural safeguards are necessary to promote the integrity and proper functioning of the initiative and referendum process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>As stated in RCW 29A.84.280, &quot;paying a worker, whose task it is to secure the signatures of voters on initiative or referendum petitions, on the basis of the number of signatures the worker secures on the petitions encourages the introduction of fraud in the signature gathering process. Such a form of payment may act as an incentive for the worker to encourage a person to sign a petition which the person is not qualified to sign or to sign a petition for a ballot measure even if the person has already signed a petition for the measure.&quot; Nevertheless, paying a worker based on the number of signatures that worker secures has proliferated in Washington state and is routinely used by ballot measure proponents to qualify initiatives and referenda.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currently, the law does not effectively deter initiative or referendum sponsors or signature-gathering entities from providing or receiving compensation or gratuity based directly or indirectly on the number of signatures obtained on an initiative or referendum petition. The legislature finds that compensation structures based on signature counts encourage fraud and mistake by incentivizing signature forgery, duplicate signing, or misrepresentation or concealment of the petition's contents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington's record shows a recurring pattern of signature fraud associated with per-signature compensation. For example, state investigators uncovered forged petition sheets submitted in support of Initiative Measure No. 985 in 2008, resulting in a criminal conviction. Elections staff reviewing Initiative Measure No. 1163 in 2011 found hundreds of fabricated signatures, including entire sheets written in a single hand. During the 2012 reviews of Referendum Measure No. 74 and Initiative Measure No. 1185, the secretary of state identified more than 1,000 forged signatures submitted by a circulator paid per signature, who later pleaded guilty. That same year, Initiative Measure No. 1240 petitions were flagged for fabricated names and forged entries, later memorialized in legislative findings. And in 2013, the random sample checks for Initiative Measure No. 517 and Initiative Measure No. 522 revealed what the secretary of state described as some of the most extensive irregularities the office had seen, including thousands of suspect signatures tied to paid circulators who were paid per signature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ninth circuit upheld Oregon's restriction on per signature compensation based on evidence from the late 1990s through 2002 which showed a direct relationship between volume-based pay and fraud and a pattern of forged signatures, clipboard stacking, and false circulator certifications. Montana's record showed a similar pattern of abuse. In 2006, a state court removed two initiatives from the ballot after investigators documented forged signatures, falsified circulator affidavits, and misrepresentations by out-of-state paid circulators. The legislature responded by prohibiting per signature compensation, and the ninth circuit later upheld that prohibition as constitutionally permissible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More recently, the secretary of state's review of a three percent sample of petition signatures submitted in support of Washington initiatives and referenda has failed to detect additional instances of fraud. However, multistate contractors that operate in Washington have been implicated in petition fraud occurring in other states. In 2023, a professional firm that previously worked in Washington state had six circulators in Colorado charged with felonies for submitting forged congressional candidate petitions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington's increasingly active initiative environment also compounds this concern. In recent years, multiple ballot measures have circulated at the same time, including in 2023, when one sponsor sought to qualify six initiatives. To qualify for the ballot, each initiative measure must currently submit at least 308,911 valid signatures within a few months, which in practice means collecting closer to 400,000. These requirements create intense pressure on paid circulators to prioritize speed and volume. Combined with per-signature compensation, this environment rewards high-output tactics and raises the risk of fraud, error, and misrepresentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To adequately guard the people's initiative and referendum right against fraud and mistake, the legislature determines that prohibiting compensation or gratuity based directly or indirectly on the number of signatures gathered is necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other states, including Oregon, Montana, and Arizona, have adopted comparable restrictions on per-signature compensation to protect the integrity of the initiative and referendum process and continued to see initiatives and referenda qualify for the ballot at stable levels. Restricting per-signature compensation has not reduced access to the ballot.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, the legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>In recent years, numerous proposed initiatives with minimal or no public support have been repeatedly filed with the secretary of state, including dozens of near-identical versions of the same measure. For example, in 2024, there were 18 versions of the same measure filed as initiatives to the people or legislature, resulting in different ballot titles for substantively identical proposals and increasing the risk of voter confusion and error. And in 2023, one filer submitted 64 measures to the people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These duplicative and low-support versions of proposed measures are often filed in an attempt to obtain a favorable ballot title or to channel judicial review of the ballot title to a specific judge. These tactics undermine the integrity and fairness of the initiative process by encouraging strategic manipulation of filing procedures, increasing the risk of inconsistent ballot titles for substantively identical measures, and increasing the likelihood that voters will be misled or confused about the substance and legal effect of the measures they are asked to sign or vote upon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that the filing of multiple proposed measures with minimal public support imposes a substantial burden and cost on the secretary of state, the attorney general, and the office of the code reviser. In recent filing cycles, these offices have expended significant staff resources reviewing and processing duplicative proposed measures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on these findings, the legislature determines that requiring a legal voter of the state proposing an initiative to gather at least 1,000 signatures prior to filing the proposed measure with the secretary of state will alleviate these burdens by ensuring that only proposals with a minimal threshold of public support proceed through the drafting and ballot title process, reducing the opportunity for bad faith or duplicative filings that create a risk of fraud, voter confusion, and mistake, and facilitate the initiative process by limiting ballot title- and judge-shopping. The legislature notes that other states, including Oregon and Ohio, require preliminary sponsorship signatures before a measure may be filed, demonstrating that such requirements facilitate the initiative process.</p>
