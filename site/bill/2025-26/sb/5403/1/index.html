<ol>
<li>
<p>As of 2024, Washington's cannabis industry generated $3,770,000,000 in excise taxes, providing vital funds for health care, education, human services, and to local governments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Due to the federal legal landscape, all cannabis produced within Washington must stay within the state's borders, which can cause downward pressure on prices that threaten the ability for small and independent producers to stay in business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to ensure a sustainable business ecosystem in the cannabis industry by allowing limited opportunities for the suppliers of cannabis retail licensees to better support themselves. The legislature does not intend to supplant or replace cannabis retail licensees by providing these limited opportunities.</p>

<pre><code>    iii. The board has discretion in adopting rules under this subsection (3)(c).

    iv. This subsection (3)(c) applies to cannabis retailer's licenses issued before and after July 23, 2017.

</code></pre>
<p>(A) The adoption of a ban or moratorium that prohibits the opening of a retail cannabis business; or</p>
<p>(B) The adoption of an ordinance or regulation related to zoning, business licensing, land use, or other regulatory measure that has the effect of preventing a licensee from receiving an occupancy permit from the jurisdiction or which otherwise prevents a licensed cannabis retailer from becoming operational.</p>

<li>
<p>There is levied and collected a cannabis excise tax equal to 37 percent of the selling price on each retail sale in this state of cannabis concentrates, useable cannabis, and cannabis-infused products. This tax is separate and in addition to general state and local sales and use taxes that apply to retail sales of tangible personal property, and is not part of the total retail price to which general state and local sales and use taxes apply. The tax must be separately itemized from the state and local retail sales tax on the sales receipt provided to the buyer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tax levied in this section must be reflected in the price list or quoted shelf price in the licensed cannabis retail store and in any advertising that includes prices for all useable cannabis, cannabis concentrates, or cannabis-infused products.</p>

<p>The tax imposed in this section must be paid by the buyer to the seller. Each seller must collect from the buyer the full amount of the tax payable on each taxable sale. The tax collected as required by this section is deemed to be held in trust by the seller until paid to the board. If any seller fails to collect the tax imposed in this section or, having collected the tax, fails to pay it as prescribed by the board, whether such failure is the result of the seller's own acts or the result of acts or conditions beyond the seller's control, the seller is, nevertheless, personally liable to the state for the amount of the tax.</p>

<p>&quot;True value&quot; means market value based on sales at comparable locations in this state of the same or similar product of like quality and character sold under comparable conditions of sale to comparable purchasers.
