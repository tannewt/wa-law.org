## Section 401
The legislature finds that providing additional services at the local level to get ahead of challenges that many individuals face, particularly children, in order to thrive is important for the success of the citizens of Washington.

The legislature further finds that there are many services that are not addressed through current funding options, including medicaid and county behavioral health programs. Existing service gaps include crisis stabilization, children mental health therapies, prevention and early interventions, behavioral health modalities, and culturally appropriate models for smaller community-based organizations. Reaching children and their families early is one of the best ways to reduce long-term needs and make a difference in overall mental health status as well as reducing youth violence, drug use, and suicides.

1. Subject to any otherwise applicable statutory dollar rate limitations, regular property taxes may be levied by or for a taxing district in an amount exceeding the limitations provided for in this chapter if such levy is authorized by a proposition approved by a majority of the voters of the taxing district voting on the proposition at a general election held within the district or at a special election within the taxing district called by the district for the purpose of submitting such proposition to the voters. Any election held pursuant to this section shall be held not more than 12 months prior to the date on which the proposed levy, or the first of the two consecutive levies, is to be made, except as provided in subsection (2) of this section. The ballot of the proposition shall state the dollar rate or rates, proposed for each year, up to two consecutive years, and shall clearly state the conditions, if any, which are applicable under subsection (4) of this section.

2. Subject to statutory dollar limitations, a proposition placed before the voters under this section may authorize annual increases in levies for multiple consecutive years, up to 10 consecutive years, during which period each year's authorized maximum legal levy shall be used as the base upon which an increased levy limit for the succeeding year is computed, but the ballot proposition must state the dollar rate proposed only for the first year of the consecutive years and must state the limit factor, or a specified index to be used for determining a limit factor, such as the consumer price index, which need not be the same for all years, by which the regular tax levy for the district may be increased in each of the subsequent consecutive years. Elections for this purpose must be held at a primary or general election. The title of each ballot measure must state the limited purposes for which the proposed annual increases during the specified period of up to 10 consecutive years shall be used.

3. After a levy authorized pursuant to this section is made, the dollar amount of such levy may not be used for the purpose of computing the limitations for subsequent levies provided for in this chapter, unless the ballot proposition expressly states that the levy made under this section will be used for this purpose.

4. If expressly stated, a proposition placed before the voters under subsection (1) or (2) of this section may:

    a. Use the dollar amount of the final levy under subsection (1) of this section, or the dollar amount of the final levy under subsection (2) of this section, for the purpose of computing the limitations for subsequent levies provided for in this chapter;

    b. Limit the period for which the increased levy is to be made under (a) of this subsection;

    f. Include any combination of the conditions in this subsection.

5. Except as otherwise expressly stated in an approved ballot measure under this section, subsequent levies shall be computed as if:

    a. The proposition under this section had not been approved; and

    b. The taxing district had made levies at the maximum rates which would otherwise have been allowed under this chapter during the years levies were made under the proposition.
