# SB 5180 - Securing the rights of students to have a safe, civil, and respectful learning community.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5180.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that Washington state has long been at the forefront of recognizing that student success is dependent on providing every student with a safe, inclusive learning environment, free of harassment and discrimination in all forms.

2. In 2010, the legislature created expansive provisions specific to public schools clearly stating that all students have the right to exist free from discrimination based on race, creed, color, national origin, honorably discharged veteran or military status, sexual orientation including gender expression or identity, the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability, or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal by a person with a disability.

3. The legislature directed the office of the superintendent of public instruction to monitor and enforce compliance with this law. To this end, in 2012, the office of the superintendent of public instruction adopted guidelines for school districts related to prohibiting discrimination in public schools that specifically addressed gender identity and gender expression and established protections for transgender students.

4. In 2019, the legislature again took action to protect students at risk of discriminatory treatment by directing the Washington state school directors' association to collaborate with the office of the superintendent of public instruction to develop and update a model transgender student policy and procedure that recognized the importance of an inclusive approach toward transgender and gender-expansive students.

5. In 2020, each school district was required to adopt a policy and procedure that incorporated all the elements of the model policy. The legislature finds, unfortunately, that some school districts are not necessarily implementing the model policy and are reading ambiguity into the laws related to the specific requirements of this model policy.

6. The legislature therefore intends to clearly state the required components of the model policy and procedure, so no ambiguity remains in the legislative intent to protect all students from discriminatory treatment in our schools. The legislature further intends to provide protections for personnel employed by or contracted with school districts, charter schools, and state-tribal education compact schools who support students in the exercise of their rights and perform work activities in a manner consistent with state law.
