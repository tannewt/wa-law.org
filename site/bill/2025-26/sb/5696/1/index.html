<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the operation or delivery of chemical dependency or mental health treatment programs and services and the operation or delivery of therapeutic court programs and services are part of local government public safety programs. New construction of facilities as well as modification of existing structures is part of that provision. The legislature finds a need to be clear that both strategies are acceptable within this chapter.</p>
