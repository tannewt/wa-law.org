<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that providing those applying for credentials with better information about credential decisions will assist their planning and decision makingand promote economic development. Making credential performance data readily accessible to applicants helps them hold government accountable to a high level of customer service and timeliness. Finally, requiring agencies to track the time it takes to issue credentials equips agency leaders with key information that can assist them in improving overall project schedules, better allocating resources, and identifying additional opportunities to better serve the public.</p>
