<p>Any suitable adult person , or any parent under the age of 21 years or, if the petition is for appointment of a professional guardian or conservator, any individual or guardianship or conservatorship service that meets any certification requirements established by the administrator for the courts, may, if not otherwise disqualified, be appointed guardian or conservator of a person subject to guardianship, conservatorship, or both. A financial institution subject to the jurisdiction of the department of financial institutions and authorized to exercise trust powers, and a federally chartered financial institution when authorized to do so, may be appointed to act as a guardian or conservator of a person subject to guardianship, conservatorship, or both without having to meet the certification requirements established by the administrator for the courts. No person is qualified to serve as a guardian or conservator who is:</p>

<p>A court may, upon consideration of the facts, find that a relative convicted of a crime is qualified to serve as a guardian or conservator;</p>

<p>A nonresident of this state who has not appointed a resident agent to accept service of process in all actions or proceedings with respect to the estate and caused such appointment to be filed with the court;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>A person whom the court finds unsuitable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a guardian, or conservator is not a certified professional guardian, conservator, or financial institution authorized under this section, the guardian or conservator must complete any standardized training video or web cast for lay guardians or conservators made available by the administrative office of the courts and the superior court where the petition is filed unless granted a waiver by the court. The training video or web cast must be provided at no cost to the guardian, or conservator.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If a petitioner requests the appointment of a specific individual to act as a guardian or conservator, the petition for guardianship or conservatorship must include evidence of the successful completion of the required training video or web cast by the proposed guardian or conservator. The superior court may defer the completion of the training requirement to a date no later than 90 days after appointment if the petitioner requests expedited appointment due to emergent circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If no person is identified to be appointed guardian or conservator at the time the petition is filed, then the court must require that the petitioner identify within 30 days from the filing of the petition a specific individual to act as guardian or conservator subject to the training requirements set forth herein. If the petitioner fails to identify a guardian or conservator within 30 days of filing, the court shall dismiss the guardianship or conservatorship.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Recommended by a guardian ad litem; or</p>

<p>The court determines the minor needs representation. The court may appoint an attorney for a minor, including in modification and termination actions, or when a minor is under age 12, as the court determines necessary.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court must appoint an attorney for a minor 12 years of age or older if the parent of the minor objects to guardianship and has an attorney, pursuant to subsection (5) or (6) of this section. If the sole petitioner is the minor, the court must provide an attorney for the minor upon receipt of the petition.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>The petitioner is indigent as defined in RCW 10.101.010 and one or more parties contest the guardianship and have either secured or been appointed legal counsel;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>In appointing a guardian under subsection (1) of this section, the following rules apply:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The court shall appoint a person nominated as guardian by a parent of the minor in a probated will or other record unless the court finds the appointment is contrary to the best interest of the minor. Any &quot;other record&quot; must be a declaration or other sworn document and may include a power of attorney or other sworn statement as to the care, custody, or control of the minor child.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If multiple parents have nominated different persons to serve as guardian, the court shall appoint the nominee whose appointment is in the best interest of the minor, unless the court finds that appointment of none of the nominees is in the best interest of the minor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a guardian is not appointed under (a) or (b) of this subsection, the court shall appoint the person nominated by the minor if the minor is 12 years of age or older unless the court finds that appointment is contrary to the best interest of the minor. In that case, the court shall appoint as guardian a person whose appointment is in the best interest of the minor.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the interest of maintaining or encouraging involvement by a minor's parent in the minor's life, developing self-reliance of the minor, or for other good cause, the court, at the time of appointment of a guardian for the minor or later, on its own or on motion of the minor or other interested person, may create a limited guardianship by limiting the powers otherwise granted by this article to the guardian. Following the same procedure, the court may grant additional powers or withdraw powers previously granted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court, as part of an order appointing a guardian for a minor, shall state rights retained by any parent of the minor, which shall preserve the parent-child relationship through an order for parent-child visitation and other contact, unless the court finds the relationship should be limited or restricted under RCW 26.09.191 or 26.09.192; and which may include decision making regarding the minor's health care, education, or other matter, or access to a record regarding the minor. In the absence of court-ordered restrictions, parents may participate in the care of the child, receive the child's records, be notified of the child's hospital care, and attend conferences and events at the child's school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An order granting a guardianship for a minor must state that each parent of the minor is entitled to notice that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The guardian has delegated custody of the minor subject to guardianship;</p>

<li>
<p>The respondent shall have the right to be represented by a willing attorney of their choosing at any stage in protective arrangement proceedings. Any attorney purporting to represent a respondent or person subject to a protective arrangement shall petition the court to be appointed to represent the respondent or person subject to a protective arrangement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless the respondent in a proceeding under this article is represented by an attorney, the court must appoint an attorney to represent the respondent, regardless of the respondent's ability to pay, when the respondent objects to the petition or requests appointment of an attorney to the court visitor.</p>
</li>

<li>If an attorney is appointed for the respondent pursuant to (b) or (c)(ii) of this subsection, the attorney shall be appointed at public expense when:</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) The respondent is unable to afford an attorney;</p>
<p>(B) The expense of an attorney would result in substantial hardship to the respondent; or</p>
<p>(C) The respondent does not have practical access to funds with which to pay an attorney. If the respondent can afford an attorney but lacks practical access to funds, the court must provide an attorney and may impose a reimbursement requirement as part of a final order.</p>
<pre><code>    ii. When, in the opinion of the court, the rights and interests of the respondent cannot otherwise be adequately protected and represented, the court on its own motion must appoint an attorney at any time to represent the respondent.

    iii. The court visitor, under the requirements of RCW 11.130.280(5), will advise the court of the need for appointment of counsel for the respondent within five court days after the meeting with the respondent.

    iv. An attorney must be provided under this subsection (1)(c) as soon as practicable after a petition is filed and long enough before any final hearing to allow adequate time for consultation and preparation. Absent a convincing showing in the record to the contrary, a period of less than three weeks is presumed by a reviewing court to be inadequate time for consultation and preparation.
