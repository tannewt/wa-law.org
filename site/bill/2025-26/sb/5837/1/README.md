A financial institution subject to the jurisdiction of the department of financial institutions and authorized to exercise trust powers, and a federally chartered financial institution when authorized to do so, may be appointed to act as a guardian or conservator of a person subject to guardianship, conservatorship, or both without having to meet the certification requirements established by the administrator for the courts. No person is qualified to serve as a guardian or conservator who is:

    a. Under 18 years of age except as otherwise provided herein;

    b. [Empty]

        i. Except as provided otherwise in (b)(ii) of this subsection, convicted of a crime involving dishonesty, neglect, or use of physical force or other crime relevant to the functions the individual would assume as guardian;

    d. A corporation not authorized to act as a fiduciary, guardian, or conservator in the state;

    e. A person whom the court finds unsuitable.

2. If a guardian, or conservator is not a certified professional guardian, conservator, or financial institution authorized under this section, the guardian or conservator must complete any standardized training video or web cast for lay guardians or conservators made available by the administrative office of the courts and the superior court where the petition is filed unless granted a waiver by the court. The training video or web cast must be provided at no cost to the guardian, or conservator.

    a. If a petitioner requests the appointment of a specific individual to act as a guardian or conservator, the petition for guardianship or conservatorship must include evidence of the successful completion of the required training video or web cast by the proposed guardian or conservator. The superior court may defer the completion of the training requirement to a date no later than 90 days after appointment if the petitioner requests expedited appointment due to emergent circumstances.

    b. If no person is identified to be appointed guardian or conservator at the time the petition is filed, then the court must require that the petitioner identify within 30 days from the filing of the petition a specific individual to act as guardian or conservator subject to the training requirements set forth herein. If the petitioner fails to identify a guardian or conservator within 30 days of filing, the court shall dismiss the guardianship or conservatorship.

2. In appointing a guardian under subsection (1) of this section, the following rules apply:

Any "other record" must be a declaration or other sworn document and may include a power of attorney or other sworn statement as to the care, custody, or control of the minor child.

    b. If multiple parents have nominated different persons to serve as guardian, the court shall appoint the nominee whose appointment is in the best interest of the minor, unless the court finds that appointment of none of the nominees is in the best interest of the minor.

    c. If a guardian is not appointed under (a) or (b) of this subsection, the court shall appoint the person nominated by the minor if the minor is 12 years of age or older unless the court finds that appointment is contrary to the best interest of the minor. In that case, the court shall appoint as guardian a person whose appointment is in the best interest of the minor.

3. In the interest of maintaining or encouraging involvement by a minor's parent in the minor's life, developing self-reliance of the minor, or for other good cause, the court, at the time of appointment of a guardian for the minor or later, on its own or on motion of the minor or other interested person, may create a limited guardianship by limiting the powers otherwise granted by this article to the guardian. Following the same procedure, the court may grant additional powers or withdraw powers previously granted.

4. The court, as part of an order appointing a guardian for a minor, shall state rights retained by any parent of the minor, which shall preserve the parent-child relationship through an order for parent-child visitation and other contact, unless the court finds the relationship should be limited or restricted under RCW 26.09.191 or 26.09.192; and which may include decision making regarding the minor's health care, education, or other matter, or access to a record regarding the minor.

5. An order granting a guardianship for a minor must state that each parent of the minor is entitled to notice that:

    a. The guardian has delegated custody of the minor subject to guardianship;

    b. The court has modified or limited the powers of the guardian; or

    c. The court has removed the guardian.

## Section 8
1. A standby guardian appointed under this section may act as guardian, with all duties and powers of a guardian under RCW 11.130.230 and 11.130.235, when no parent of the minor is willing or able to exercise the duties and powers granted to the guardian.

6. The court may, upon a showing of good cause, order that the information concerning the reasons for the standby guardianship contained in the petition and all subsequently filed pleadings and evidence by any party not be served on the minor if the minor is unrepresented. A minor entitled to service under this subsection may request access to the court pleadings and evidence filed in the court record.

7. A person entitled to notice under subsection (5) of this section, not later than 60 days after service of the petition and statement, may object to appointment of the standby guardian by filing an objection with the court and giving notice of the objection to each other person entitled to notice under subsection (5) of this section.

8. If an objection is filed under subsection (7) of this section, the court shall hold a hearing to determine whether a standby guardian should be appointed and, if so, the person that should be appointed. If no objection is filed, the court may make the appointment.

    a. The standby guardian assumes the duties and powers of the guardian;

## Section 9
1. On its own, on motion when a guardianship petition is filed under RCW 11.130.190, or on petition by a person interested in a minor's welfare, including the minor, the court may appoint an emergency guardian for the minor if the court finds:

    a. Appointment of an emergency guardian is likely to prevent substantial harm to the minor's health, safety, or welfare; and

    b. No other person appears to have authority, ability, and the willingness to act to prevent substantial harm to the minor's health, safety, or welfare.

2. The duration of authority of an emergency guardian for a minor may not exceed 60 days and the emergency guardian may exercise only the powers specified in the order of appointment. The emergency guardian's authority may be extended once for not more than 60 days if the court finds that the conditions for appointment of an emergency guardian in subsection (1) of this section continue.

3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4) of this section, reasonable notice, including by methods described in RCW 11.130.195(2)(b) (ii) and (iii), of the date, time, and place of a hearing on a motion for or a petition for appointment of an emergency guardian for a minor must be given to:

If the court appoints an immediate emergency guardian without notice to an unrepresented minor or the attorney for a represented minor, notice of the appointment must be given not later than four days after the appointment to the individuals listed in subsection (3) of this section. Not later than 14 days after the appointment, the court shall hold a hearing on the appropriateness of the appointment; provided, however, that the 14-day period may be extended by agreement or for good cause at the court's discretion.

5. Appointment of an emergency guardian under this section, with or without notice, is not a determination that a basis exists for appointment of a guardian under RCW 11.130.185.

6. The court may remove an emergency guardian appointed under this section at any time. The emergency guardian shall make any report the court requires.

7. Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, the court may extend an emergency guardianship pending the outcome of a full hearing under RCW 11.130.190 or 11.130.220.

4. The court shall follow the priorities in RCW 11.130.215(2) when selecting a successor guardian for a minor.

5. Not later than 30 days after appointment of a successor guardian for a minor, the court shall give notice of the appointment to the minor subject to guardianship, if the minor is 12 years of age or older, each parent of the minor, and any other person the court determines.

6. When terminating a guardianship for a minor under this section, the court may issue an order providing for transitional arrangements that will assist the minor with a transition of custody and is in the best interest of the minor.

7. A guardian for a minor that is removed shall cooperate with a successor guardian to facilitate transition of the guardian's responsibilities and protect the best interest of the minor.
