## Section 3
(1) The workforce education investment account is created in the state treasury. All revenues from the workforce investment surcharge created in RCW 82.04.299 and those revenues as specified under RCW 82.04.290(2)(c) must be deposited directly into the account. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Expenditures from the account may be used only for higher education programs, higher education operations, higher education compensation, state-funded student aid programs, and workforce development including career connected learning as defined by RCW 28C.30.020. Beginning in fiscal year 2025, and each year thereafter, an amount equal to all the revenues derived from the surcharge imposed under RCW 82.04.299 must be used exclusively for higher education programs that lead to a credential in advanced computing, as defined in RCW 82.04.299, and related science, technology, engineering, and math computing fields to increase access and equity, especially for students from traditionally underserved communities.

Allen school of computer science by 100, then additional enrollments must be automatically added and funded from the surcharge imposed under RCW 82.04.299 to accommodate the additional demand. The University of Washington shall submit a report, in accordance with RCW 43.01.036, to the appropriate committees of the legislature annually, beginning June 30, 2026, on program graduation rates, waitlist for entry into the program, time to degree completion, and degrees awarded.
