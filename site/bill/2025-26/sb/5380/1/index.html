<p>The obligations applicable to lead agencies under sections 2 and 3 of this act are in addition to and do not limit or amend the obligations of covered agencies under chapter 70A.02 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A covered agency under chapter 70A.02 RCW may adopt any environmental justice assessment prepared under that chapter or apply other analyses or processes under that chapter to satisfy the requirements of sections 2 or 3 of this act, to the extent that such an environmental justice assessment and other analyses or processes under that chapter are sufficient to satisfy the requirements of sections 2 or 3 of this act.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>A lead agency may require a proponent of a proposed action to reimburse the agency for demonstrated costs to carry out an environmental justice impact statement carried out under section 3 of this act.</p>

<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The department of ecology or board of any authority may require notice of the establishment of any proposed new sources except single-family and duplex dwellings or de minimis new sources as defined in rules adopted under subsection (11) of this section. The department of ecology or board may require such notice to be accompanied by a fee and determine the amount of such fee: PROVIDED, That the amount of the fee may not exceed the cost of reviewing the plans, specifications, and other information and administering such notice: PROVIDED FURTHER, That any such notice given or notice of construction application submitted to either the board or to the department of ecology shall preclude a further submittal of a duplicate application to any board or to the department of ecology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall, after opportunity for public review and comment, adopt rules that establish a workload-driven process for determination and review of the fee covering the direct and indirect costs of processing a notice of construction application and a methodology for tracking revenues and expenditures. All new source fees collected by the delegated local air authorities from sources shall be deposited in the dedicated accounts of their respective treasuries. All new source fees collected by the department from sources shall be deposited in the air pollution control account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within thirty days of receipt of a notice of construction application, the department of ecology or board may require, as a condition precedent to the establishment of the new source or sources covered thereby, the submission of plans, specifications, and such other information as it deems necessary to determine whether the proposed new source will be in accord with applicable rules and regulations in force under this chapter. If on the basis of plans, specifications, or other information required under this section the department of ecology or board determines that the proposed new source will not be in accord with this chapter or the applicable ordinances, resolutions, rules, and regulations adopted under this chapter, it shall issue an order denying permission to establish the new source. If on the basis of plans, specifications, or other information required under this section, the department of ecology or board determines that the proposed new source will be in accord with this chapter, and the applicable rules and regulations adopted under this chapter, it shall issue an order of approval for the establishment of the new source or sources, which order may provide such conditions as are reasonably necessary to assure the maintenance of compliance with this chapter and the applicable rules and regulations adopted under this chapter. Every order of approval under this chapter must be reviewed prior to issuance by a professional engineer or staff under the supervision of a professional engineer in the employ of the department of ecology or board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The determination required under subsection (3) of this section shall include a determination of whether the operation of the new air contaminant source at the location proposed will cause any ambient air quality standard to be exceeded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New source review of a modification shall be limited to the emission unit or units proposed to be modified and the air contaminants whose emissions would increase as a result of the modification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the department of ecology or board to require the use of emission control equipment or other equipment, machinery, or devices of any particular type, from any particular supplier, or produced by any particular manufacturer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any features, machines, and devices constituting parts of or called for by plans, specifications, or other information submitted pursuant to subsection (1) or (3) of this section shall be maintained and operate in good working order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The absence of an ordinance, resolution, rule, or regulation, or the failure to issue an order pursuant to this section shall not relieve any person from his or her obligation to comply with applicable emission control requirements or with any other provision of law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within thirty days of receipt of a notice of construction application the department of ecology or board shall either notify the applicant in writing that the application is complete or notify the applicant in writing of all additional information necessary to complete the application. Within sixty days of receipt of a complete application the department or board shall either (a) issue a final decision on the application, or (b) for those projects subject to public notice, initiate notice and comment on a proposed decision, followed as promptly as possible by a final decision. A person seeking approval to construct or modify a source that requires an operating permit may elect to integrate review of the operating permit application or amendment required by RCW 70A.15.2260 and the notice of construction application required by this section. A notice of construction application designated for integrated review shall be processed in accordance with operating permit program procedures and deadlines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A notice of construction approval required under subsection (3) of this section shall include a determination that the new source will achieve best available control technology. If more stringent controls are required under federal law, the notice of construction shall include a determination that the new source will achieve the more stringent federal requirements. Nothing in this subsection is intended to diminish other state authorities under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No person is required to submit a notice of construction or receive approval for a new source that is deemed by the department of ecology or board to have de minimis impact on air quality. The department of ecology shall adopt and periodically update rules identifying categories of de minimis new sources. The department of ecology may identify de minimis new sources by category, size, or emission thresholds.</p>

<li>
<p>Except as provided in (c) of this subsection, the department of ecology or board may not issue a notice of construction order of approval to any of the following types of new air contaminant sources that are located in a census tract that is ranked as a nine or a 10 for environmental exposures in the environmental health disparities map maintained by the department of health under RCW 43.70.815, as the methodology for ranking environmental exposures existed as of the effective date of this section:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>A major source of air pollution regulated and required to obtain a permit under this chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A source regulated and required to obtain a prevention of significant deterioration permit under this chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An incinerator, as defined in RCW 70A.216.010; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A medical waste incinerator.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>By rule, the department may adopt an alternative methodology for identifying the census tracts specified in (a) of this subsection in the event that the department of health substantively amends the methodology used to identify or rank environmental exposures under RCW 43.70.815.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provisions of this subsection (12) do not apply to:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>

<p>For purposes of this section, &quot;de minimis new sources&quot; means new sources with trivial levels of emissions that do not pose a threat to human health or the environment.</p>
