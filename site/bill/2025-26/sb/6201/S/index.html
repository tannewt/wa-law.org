<p>As used in this chapter, the term &quot;sale&quot; has its ordinary meaning and includes any conveyance, grant, assignment, quitclaim, or transfer of the ownership of or title to real property, including standing timber, or any estate or interest therein for a valuable consideration, and any contract for such conveyance, grant, assignment, quitclaim, or transfer, and any lease with an option to purchase real property, including standing timber, or any estate or interest therein or other contract under which possession of the property is given to the purchaser, or any other person at the purchaser's direction, and title to the property is retained by the vendor as security for the payment of the purchase price. The term also includes the grant, assignment, quitclaim, sale, or transfer of improvements constructed upon leased land.</p>
</li>
<li>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The term &quot;sale&quot; also includes the transfer or acquisition within any 36 month period of a controlling interest in any entity with an interest in real property located in this state for a valuable consideration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the sole purpose of determining whether, pursuant to the exercise of an option, a controlling interest was transferred or acquired within a 36 month period, the date that the option agreement was executed is the date on which the transfer or acquisition of the controlling interest is deemed to occur. For all other purposes under this chapter, the date upon which the option is exercised is the date of the transfer or acquisition of the controlling interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this subsection, all acquisitions of persons acting in concert must be aggregated for purposes of determining whether a transfer or acquisition of a controlling interest has taken place. The department must adopt standards by rule to determine when persons are acting in concert. In adopting a rule for this purpose, the department must consider the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Persons must be treated as acting in concert when they have a relationship with each other such that one person influences or controls the actions of another through common ownership; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When persons are not commonly owned or controlled, they must be treated as acting in concert only when the unity with which the purchasers have negotiated and will consummate the transfer of ownership interests supports a finding that they are acting as a single entity. If the acquisitions are completely independent, with each purchaser buying without regard to the identity of the other purchasers, then the acquisitions are considered separate acquisitions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The term &quot;sale&quot; does not include:</p>
<ol type="a">

<p>A transfer by gift, devise, or inheritance.</p>

<p>A transfer of real property, however effected, if it consists of a mere change in identity or form of ownership of an entity where there is no change in the beneficial ownership. These include transfers to a corporation or partnership which is wholly owned by the transferor and/or the transferor's spouse or domestic partner or children of the transferor or the transferor's spouse or domestic partner. However, if thereafter such transferee corporation or partnership voluntarily transfers such real property, or such transferor, spouse or domestic partner, or children of the transferor or the transferor's spouse or domestic partner voluntarily transfer stock in the transferee corporation or interest in the transferee partnership capital, as the case may be, to other than (i) the transferor and/or the transferor's spouse or domestic partner or children of the transferor or the transferor's spouse or domestic partner, (ii) a trust having the transferor and/or the transferor's spouse or domestic partner or children of the transferor or the transferor's spouse or domestic partner as the only beneficiaries at the time of the transfer to the trust, or (iii) a corporation or partnership wholly owned by the original transferor and/or the transferor's spouse or domestic partner or children of the transferor or the transferor's spouse or domestic partner, within three years of the original transfer to which this exemption applies, and the tax on the subsequent transfer has not been paid within 60 days of becoming due, excise taxes become due and payable on the original transfer as otherwise provided by law.</p>

<p>The Washington state housing finance commission, in consultation with the department, must gather data on: (A) The fiscal savings, if any, accruing to transferees as a result of the exemption provided in this subsection (3)(s); (B) the extent to which transferors of qualified low-income housing developments receive consideration, including any assumption of debt, as part of a transfer subject to the exemption provided in this subsection (3)(s); and (C) the continued use of the property for low-income housing.

<li>
<p>If less than 50 percent of the occupied dwelling units within the rental housing are occupied by qualifying households, the rental housing is eligible for a partial exemption on the real property and a total exemption of the housing's personal property as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A partial exemption is allowed for each dwelling unit in the rental housing occupied by a qualifying household.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amount of exemption must be calculated by multiplying the assessed value of the property reasonably necessary to provide the rental housing by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the number of dwelling units occupied by qualifying households as of December 31st of the first assessment year in which the rental housing becomes operational or on January 1st of each subsequent assessment year for which the exemption is claimed. The denominator of the fraction is the total number of dwelling units occupied as of December 31st of the first assessment year the rental housing becomes operational and January 1st of each subsequent assessment year for which the exemption is claimed.</p>

<p>If a currently exempt rental housing unit was occupied by a qualifying household at the time the exemption was granted and the income of the household subsequently rises above the threshold set in subsection (7)(f) of this section but remains at or below 115 percent of the median income, the exemption will continue as long as the housing continues to meet the certification requirements listed in subsection (1) of this section. For purposes of this section, median income, as most recently determined by the federal department of housing and urban development for the county in which the rental housing or mobile home park is located, must be adjusted for family size. However, if a dwelling unit or a lot becomes vacant and is subsequently rerented, the income of the new household must be at or below the threshold set in subsection (7)(f) of this section to remain exempt from property tax.</p>

<li>
<p>If at the time of initial application the property is unoccupied, or subsequent to the initial application the property is unoccupied because of renovations, and the property is not currently being used for the exempt purpose authorized by this section but will be used for the exempt purpose within three assessment years, the property is eligible for a property tax exemption for the assessment year in which the claim for exemption is submitted under the following conditions:</p>
<ol type="a">

<p>The social housing agency has manifested its intent in writing to construct, remodel, or otherwise convert the property to housing for qualifying households; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only the portion of property that will be used to provide housing or lots for qualifying households is exempt under this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be exempt under this section, the property must be used exclusively for the purposes for which the exemption is granted, except as provided in RCW 84.36.805.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The social housing agency qualifying for a property tax exemption under this section may agree to make payments to the city, county, or other political subdivision for improvements, services, and facilities furnished by the city, county, or political subdivision for the benefit of the rental housing. However, these payments may not exceed the amount last levied as the annual tax of the city, county, or political subdivision upon the property prior to exemption.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Low-income&quot; means household income as defined by the department, provided that the definition may not exceed 80 percent of median household income, adjusted for household size, for the county in which the dwelling is located;</p>

The fifty and fifteen-day limitations provided in this subsection (8)(a) do not include days during which setup and takedown activities take place immediately preceding or following a meeting or other event by an individual, group, or entity using the property as provided in this subsection (8)(a).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If uses of the exempt property exceed the fifty and fifteen-day limitations provided in (a) of this subsection (8) during an assessment year, the exemption is removed for the affected portion of the property for that assessment year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 15-day and 50-day limitations provided in (a) of this subsection (8) do not apply to property exempt under RCW 84.36.037 if the property is used for activities related to a qualifying farmers market, as defined in RCW 66.24.170, and all income received from rental or use of the exempt property is used for capital improvements to the exempt property, maintenance and operation of the exempt property, or exempt purposes. Exempt property under RCW 84.36.037 may be used for up to 53 days for the purposes of a qualifying farmers market.</p>
