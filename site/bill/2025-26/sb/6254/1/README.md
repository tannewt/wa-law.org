## Section 1
The legislature finds that affordability is an increasing concern of both residents and businesses in Washington. The legislature intends with this act to take advantage of the capabilities of agentic artificial intelligence to streamline and simplify state regulations, identifying areas with disconnects from statutory authority, redundancies, contradictions, or overly complex and unnecessary language. It is the goal of this regulatory reform to make state government more efficient and accountable to residents, ease the affordability crisis facing many in our state, and help unleash our economy in a way that benefits all citizens.

## Section 4
1. By December 31, 2026, the office shall produce a third-party, artificial intelligence-generated analysis of all rules and guidance documents issued by state agencies in the form of a regulatory reduction report. This report shall identify unnecessary regulatory requirements and highlight language in rules and guidance documents that can be streamlined.

2. Each agency shall report to the office on its intended actions no later than four weeks from the day it receives the regulatory reduction report.

Each agency shall then initiate the regulatory actions supported by the regulatory report's findings and provide the office with its future review schedule as required by section 6 of this act within four weeks from the date it communicates its intended actions to the office under subsection (2) of this section.

## Section 5
1. By December 31, 2026, and every four years thereafter, each agency shall seek to leverage artificial intelligence for analysis of each rule to determine the following:

    a. The extent to which each requirement in the rule is mandated by state statute, federal statute, or regulation, or another source of binding law;

    b. The extent to which each requirement in the rule may be redundant of or in conflict with other provisions of state or federal law;

    d. The extent to which the text of the rule might be streamlined to eliminate excess verbiage while accomplishing the same purpose and goals.

2. Upon final legal review of the analysis, but no later than June 30, 2027, each agency shall:

    a. Eliminate any rules or requirements that conflict with binding law or that duplicate existing regulations or statutes. When possible, each agency shall use the expedited rule-making process in RCW 34.05.353 to eliminate any such duplicative or conflicting rules or requirements;

    a. Requirements exceeding those in state or federal statute, regulations, or other binding authority;

    b. Consistency with state and federal statutes, regulations, and other binding authority; and

    c. Opportunities to streamline text while preserving the required information accomplishing the same purpose and goals.

    a. Remove provisions creating new binding legal requirements not already established in existing statutes or regulations; and

    b. Ensure each guidance document accurately reflects all relevant legal provisions and minimizes word count while maintaining clarity and completeness.
