## Section 1
The legislature finds that Washington faces a housing shortage, with the greatest challenges affecting low-income households. The imbalance between housing supply and demand has driven up costs, making it increasingly difficult for households to secure housing near jobs and essential services.

The legislature also finds that expanding development opportunities on underutilized commercial properties can help Washington in meeting its housing goals of over 1,000,000 new housing units by 2044. Higher density, mixed-use development along underutilized commercial arterials—particularly near jobs, transit, and essential services—can help provide much needed housing.

The legislature further finds that updating land use policies, easing parking requirements, and increasing flexibility in permitting, may help to facilitate more housing development. The legislature intends to incentivize the development of underutilized commercial properties for mixed-income and affordable housing through public and private partnerships.

## Section 2
1. The department shall solicit letters of interest from the owners or developers of retail or commercial properties with substantial potential for redevelopment as residential or mixed-use properties providing market rate and affordable housing supply. Letters of interest must be received no later than October 1, 2025. The department's instructions for the letters of interest shall request, at a minimum, the following information about the housing redevelopment project concept:

    a. Information on the location of the property, and its proximity to employment centers, public schools, transit, and local amenities or services;

    b. A description of the existing land uses at the property, and any available information about future operations of existing businesses at the property;

    c. A description of any concepts or plans to convert the property into primarily residential uses, along with any associated commercial or retail uses that would serve residents of the area;

    d. A description of the proposed phasing plan for the development, if necessary. If phased, the applicant may provide a description of how housing development may be expedited through increased predictability in the applicable development regulations, fees, and other construction-related regulations through vesting or other mechanisms;

    e. An assessment of infrastructure improvements needed to convert the primary use of the property from retail or commercial use to residential or mixed-use purpose;

    f. A description of any regulatory fees, taxes, or incentives that could delay or prevent the redevelopment of the property for housing, and any incentives that if applied to the property, would expedite redevelopment for housing purposes including affordable housing;

    g. The status of any environmental review or permitting activity to date, including the status of any development agreements with local governments; and

    h. The degree of funding that has already been committed to the project by nonstate entities.

2. The department must review the information provided in the letter of interest to determine eligibility by October 31, 2025. Eligible properties:

Permit applications under this section must be informed of inconsistencies with all qualifying criteria within 90 days, and projects must be processed and reviewed for all local objective standards within 180 days. If the jurisdiction misses the 90 day deadline, the project is deemed to be compliant with the relevant zoning rules and other land use standards;

    b. Be given priority for funding awarded by the department under the connecting housing to infrastructure program, early learning facilities program, and energy efficiency retrofits grants if that funding is necessary for an applicant to move forward with the project;

8. This section expires June 30, 2027.

## Section 3
1. The value of new housing construction, conversion, and rehabilitation improvements qualifying under this chapter is exempt from ad valorem property taxation for 20 successive years beginning January 1st of the year immediately following the calendar year of issuance of the certificate, if the property otherwise qualifies for the exemption under this chapter and meets the conditions in this section.

2. The exemption in this section does not include the value of land or nonhousing-related improvements not qualifying under this chapter. The exemption in this section includes the value of the newly created housing determined by multiplying the overall value by the percentage of square footage of affordable newly created housing in comparison to the total square footage of housing for a qualifying project.

The audit or review program must be adopted in consultation with local governments and other stakeholders and may be based on auditing a percentage of income-restricted units or properties annually. A private owner or operator of a property for which a certificate of tax exemption has been issued under this chapter, must be audited at least once every five years.

    b. If the review or audit required under (a) of this subsection for a given property finds that the owner or operator is not offering the number of units at rents as committed to in the approved application or is not properly screening tenants for income-restricted units, the department of commerce must notify the city or county and the city or county must impose and collect a sliding scale penalty not to exceed an amount calculated by subtracting the amount of rents that would have been collected had the owner or operator complied with their commitment from the amount of rents collected by the owner or operator for the income-restricted units, with consideration of the severity of the noncompliance. If a subsequent review or audit required under (a) of this subsection for a given property finds continued substantial noncompliance with the program requirements, the exemption certificate must be canceled pursuant to RCW 84.14.110.

    c. The department of commerce may impose and collect a fee, not to exceed the costs of the audit or review, from the owner or operator of any property subject to an audit or review required under (a) of this subsection.

4. The department of commerce must provide guidance to cities and counties, which issue certificates of tax exemption for multiunit housing that conform to the requirements of this chapter, on best practices in managing and reporting for the exemption programs authorized under this chapter, including guidance for cities and counties to collect and report demographic information for tenants of units receiving a tax exemption under this chapter.

5. This section expires January 1, 2058.

## Section 10
1. If improvements have been exempted under this chapter, the improvements continue to be exempted for the applicable period under this chapter, so long as they are not converted to another use and continue to satisfy all applicable conditions. If the owner intends to convert the multifamily development to another use, or if applicable, if the owner intends to discontinue compliance with the affordable housing requirements as described in this chapter or any other condition to exemption, the owner must notify the assessor within 60 days of the change in use or intended discontinuance. If, after a certificate of tax exemption has been filed with the county assessor, the authorized representative of the governing authority discovers that a portion of the property is changed or will be changed to a use that is other than residential or that housing or amenities no longer meet the requirements, including, if applicable, affordable housing requirements, as previously approved or agreed upon by contract between the city or county and the owner and that the multifamily housing, or a portion of the housing, no longer qualifies for the exemption, the tax exemption must be canceled and the following must occur:

    a. Additional real property tax must be imposed upon the value of the nonqualifying improvements in the amount that would normally be imposed, plus a penalty must be imposed amounting to 20 percent. This additional tax is calculated based upon the difference between the property tax paid and the property tax that would have been paid if it had included the value of the nonqualifying improvements dated back to the date that the improvements were converted to a nonmultifamily use;

    b. The tax must include interest upon the amounts of the additional tax at the same statutory rate charged on delinquent property taxes from the dates on which the additional tax could have been paid without penalty if the improvements had been assessed at a value without regard to this chapter; and

    c. The additional tax owed together with interest and penalty must become a lien on the land and attach at the time the property or portion of the property is removed from multifamily use or the amenities no longer meet applicable requirements, and has priority to and must be fully paid and satisfied before a recognizance, mortgage, judgment, debt, obligation, or responsibility to or with which the land may become charged or liable. The lien may be foreclosed upon expiration of the same period after delinquency and in the same manner provided by law for foreclosure of liens for delinquent real property taxes. An additional tax unpaid on its due date is delinquent. From the date of delinquency until paid, interest must be charged at the same rate applied by law to delinquent ad valorem property taxes.

2. Upon a determination that a tax exemption is to be canceled for a reason stated in this section, the governing authority or authorized representative must notify the record owner of the property as shown by the tax rolls by mail, return receipt requested, of the determination to cancel the exemption. The owner may appeal the determination to the governing authority or authorized representative, within 30 days by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the governing authority, which notice must specify the factual and legal basis on which the determination of cancellation is alleged to be erroneous. The governing authority or a hearing examiner or other official authorized by the governing authority may hear the appeal. At the hearing, all affected parties may be heard and all competent evidence received. After the hearing, the deciding body or officer must either affirm, modify, or repeal the decision of cancellation of exemption based on the evidence received. An aggrieved party may appeal the decision of the deciding body or officer to the superior court under RCW 34.05.510 through 34.05.598.

3. Upon determination by the governing authority or authorized representative to terminate an exemption, the county officials having possession of the assessment and tax rolls must correct the rolls in the manner provided for omitted property under RCW 84.40.080. The county assessor must make such a valuation of the property and improvements as is necessary to permit the correction of the rolls. The value of the new housing construction, conversion, and rehabilitation improvements added to the rolls is considered as new construction for the purposes of chapter 84.55 RCW. The owner may appeal the valuation to the county board of equalization under chapter 84.48 RCW and according to the provisions of RCW 84.40.038. If there has been a failure to comply with this chapter, the property must be listed as an omitted assessment for assessment years beginning January 1st of the calendar year in which the noncompliance first occurred, but the listing as an omitted assessment may not be for a period more than three calendar years preceding the year in which the failure to comply was discovered.
