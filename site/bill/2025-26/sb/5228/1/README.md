# SB 5228 - Updating the governor's interagency coordinating council on health disparities.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5228.pdf)

## Section 1
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

## Section 2
The legislature finds that women and people of color experience significant disparities from men and the general population in education, employment, healthful living conditions, access to health care, and other social determinants of health. The legislature finds that these circumstances coupled with lower, slower, and less culturally appropriate and gender appropriate access to needed medical care result in higher rates of morbidity and mortality for women and persons of color than observed in the general population. Health disparities are defined by the national institutes of health as the differences in incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of disease and other adverse health conditions that exist among specific population groups in the United States.

It is the intent of the Washington state legislature to create the healthiest state in the nation by striving to eliminate health disparities in people of color and between men and women. In meeting the intent of this chapter, the legislature creates the governor's council for health justice and equity. This council shall create an action plan and statewide policy to include health impact reviews that measure and address other social determinants of health that lead to disparities as well as the contributing factors of health that can have broad impacts on improving status, health literacy, physical activity, and nutrition.

## Section 3

Following completion of the initial community health needs assessment, each hospital in accordance with the internal revenue service shall complete and make widely available to the public and submit to the department an assessment once every three years. The department must post the information submitted to it pursuant to this subsection on its website.

2. [Empty]

    a. Unless contained in the community health needs assessment under subsection (1) of this section, a hospital subject to the requirements under subsection (1) of this section shall make public and submit to the department a description of the community served by the hospital, including both a geographic description and a description of the general population served by the hospital; and demographic information such as leading causes of death, levels of chronic illness, and descriptions of the medically underserved, low‑income, and minority, or chronically ill populations in the community.

    b. [Empty]

        i. Beginning July 1, 2022, a hospital, other than a hospital designated by medicare as a critical access hospital or sole community hospital, that is subject to the requirements under subsection (1) of this section must annually submit to the department an addendum which details information about activities identified as community health improvement services with a cost of $5,000 or more. The addendum must include the type of activity, the method in which the activity was delivered, how the activity relates to an identified community need in the community health needs assessment, the target population for the activity, strategies to reach the target population, identified outcome metrics, the cost to the hospital to provide the activity, the methodology used to calculate the hospital's costs, and the number of people served by the activity. If a community health improvement service is administered by an entity other than the hospital, the other entity must be identified in the addendum.

        ii. Beginning July 1, 2022, a hospital designated by medicare as a critical access hospital or sole community hospital that is subject to the requirements under subsection (1) of this section must annually submit to the department an addendum which details information about the 10 highest cost activities identified as community health improvement services. The addendum must include the type of activity, the method in which the activity was delivered, how the activity relates to an identified community need in the community health needs assessment, the target population for the activity, strategies to reach the target population, identified outcome metrics, the cost to the hospital to provide the activity, the methodology used to calculate the hospital's costs, and the number of people served by the activity. If a community health improvement service is administered by an entity other than the hospital, the other entity must be identified in the addendum.

        iii. The department shall require the reporting of demographic information about participant race, ethnicity, any disability, gender identity, preferred language, and zip code of primary residency. The department, in consultation with interested entities, may revise the required demographic information according to an established six-year review cycle about participant race, ethnicity, disabilities, gender identity, preferred language, and zip code of primary residence that must be reported under (b)(i) and (ii) of this subsection (2). At a minimum, the department's consultation process shall include community organizations that provide community health improvement services, communities impacted by health inequities, health care workers, hospitals, and the governor's  council for health justice and equity. The department shall establish a six-year cycle for the review of the information requested under this subsection (2)(b)(iii).

        iv. The department shall provide guidance on participant data collection and the reporting requirements under this subsection (2)(b). The guidance shall include a standard form for the reporting of information under this subsection (2)(b). The standard form must allow for the reporting of community health improvement services that are repeated within a reporting period to be combined within the addendum as a single project with the number of instances of the services listed. The department must develop the guidelines in consultation with interested entities, including an association representing hospitals in Washington, labor unions representing workers who work in hospital settings, and community health board associations. The department must post the information submitted to it pursuant to this subsection (2)(b) on its website.

3. [Empty]

    a. Each hospital subject to the requirements of subsection (1) of this section shall make widely available to the public a community benefit implementation strategy within one year of completing its community health needs assessment.

Unless contained in the implementation strategy under this subsection (3)(a), the hospital must provide a brief explanation for not accepting recommendations for community benefit proposals identified in the assessment through the stakeholder consultation process, such as excessive expense to implement or infeasibility of implementation of the proposal.

    b. Implementation strategies must be evidence‑based, when available; or development and implementation of innovative programs and practices should be supported by evaluation measures.

4. When requesting demographic information under subsection (2)(b) of this section, a hospital must inform participants that providing the information is voluntary. If a hospital fails to report demographic information under subsection (2)(b) of this section because a participant refused to provide the information, the department may not take any action against the hospital for failure to comply with reporting requirements or other licensing standards on that basis.

5. For the purposes of this section, the term "widely available to the public" has the same meaning as in the internal revenue service guidelines.
