<p>Any individual or plumbing contractor who is determined by final order to have committed three infractions involving residential service plumbing or construction performed on a residential structure within a 36-month period may have his or her certificate, license, endorsement, or registration suspended for a period of up to two years upon recommendation of the advisory board of plumbers. For purposes of this subsection, multiple infractions or violations created by a single inspection or audit are counted as one infraction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an individual or plumbing contractor is determined by final order to have committed five or more infractions within a five-year period, the department may issue an order suspending the individual's or contractor's certificate, license, endorsement, or registration for up to two years. The order must set forth each of the infractions that form the basis of the suspension. The suspension must be measured from the date of the department's final order. The department may issue other appropriate remedies, such as requiring an individual or plumbing contractor to submit a corrective action plan addressing the deficiencies that led to the infractions before the certificate, license, endorsement, or registration may be reinstated. For purposes of this subsection, multiple infractions or violations created by a single inspection or audit are counted as one infraction. This subsection (4)(b) does not apply to infractions involving residential service plumbing or construction performed on a residential structure.</p>
