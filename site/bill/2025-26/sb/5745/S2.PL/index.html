</li>
<li>
<p>Reimbursement for judicial services shall be provided per civil commitment case at a rate to be determined based on an independent assessment of the county's or tribe's actual direct costs.

In the event that a baseline cannot be established because there is no significant history of similar cases within the county or tribe, the reimbursement rate shall be equal to 80 percent of the median reimbursement rate of counties or tribes, if applicable included in the independent assessment.</p>

</li>
<li>
