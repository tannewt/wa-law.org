The model policy must be consistent with federal and state law and ensure that early learning provider settings and facilities remain safe and accessible to all Washington residents, regardless of immigration status or citizenship status. The attorney general may elect to publish more than one model policy to address the needs of different early learning providers, taking into account differences in facilities, settings, available resources, and other relevant factors.
