    b. Allow an officer or employee of an agency conducting immigration enforcement to enter a nonpublic area of an early learning or child care site for any purpose without being presented with a valid judicial warrant, judicial subpoena, or a court order. An early learning provider shall, to the extent practicable, request a valid form of identification from an officer or employee of an agency conducting immigration enforcement seeking to enter a nonpublic area of an early learning or child care site. This subsection may not be construed to limit an early learning provider's right to consult with counsel or challenge the validity of a judicial warrant, judicial subpoena, or court order in a court of competent jurisdiction.

2. The early learning provider shall, in a timely manner, report to the department any request for information or access to an early learning or child care site by any officer or employee of a law enforcement agency for the purpose of enforcing immigration laws. Any report made under this subsection must be provided in a manner that ensures the confidentiality and privacy of any potential identifying information.

If an early learning provider is aware that a child's parent or legal guardian is not available to care for the student, the early learning provider shall first exhaust any parental instruction relating to the child's care in the emergency contact information it has for the child to arrange for the child's care. An early learning provider is encouraged to work with parents or legal guardians to update the emergency contact information and not contact the department to arrange for the child's care unless the early learning provider is unable to arrange for care through the use of emergency contact information or other information or instructions provided by the parent or legal guardian.

4. The early learning provider shall provide information to parents and guardians, as appropriate, regarding their children's eligibility for certain early learning programs regardless of immigration or citizenship status or religious beliefs. This information must include "know your rights" immigration enforcement information established by the attorney general and may be provided in an annual notification to parents and legal guardians or any other cost-effective means determined by the early learning provider.

This section does not prohibit or restrict any governmental entity or official from sending to, or receiving from, federal immigration authorities, information regarding the immigration or citizenship status, lawful or unlawful, of an individual, or from requesting from federal immigration authorities immigration status information, lawful or unlawful, or any individual, or maintaining or exchanging that information with any other federal, state, or local governmental entity, pursuant to 8 U.S.C.
