<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that in 2021 the legislature created the habitat recovery pilot program to streamline project permitting for habitat restoration projects that have been determined to contribute to the recovery of watersheds throughout the state. The legislature also finds that the pilot project's intent to advance projects to construction as quickly and efficiently as possible has been realized, with projects experiencing time and cost savings by utilizing the streamlined process. It is the intent of the legislature to make this permit pathway an option and not to replace or supplant current permit requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to make the pilot program permanent and to improve the streamlined process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The habitat restoration permit pathway program is created. The habitat restoration permit pathway as outlined in this section does not replace or supplant the permit requirements under this chapter, but rather may be used as an optional permit pathway.</p>

<p>The department may not review a project under the expedited process created in this section if a cultural resource site is identified at the project site or if an affected federally recognized tribe withholds its consent that the project should be expedited according to the process set forth in this section. Such consent may be withheld upon a determination that the project may adversely impact cultural resources. Notice of such a determination must be provided to the department by the affected federally recognized tribe in a timely manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the event of an inadvertent discovery of cultural resources or human remains, the project applicant shall immediately notify the department, the department of archaeology and historic preservation, and affected federally recognized tribes. In the event of an inadvertent discovery of cultural resources or human remains, existing requirements applicable to inadvertent discoveries of cultural resources and human remains, including those set forth in chapters 27.53, 27.44, and 68.60 RCW, apply.</p>
