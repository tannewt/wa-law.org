# SB 5724 - Dual credit programs

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5724.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that students who participate in dual credit programs have higher rates of college enrollment, persistence, and completion. Dual credit programs are an important element of economic development for Washington because they equip students with the skills needed for high-skill, high-wage employment and continued education in high-demand sectors.

2. Strengthening dual credit programs and transitions from secondary to postsecondary education requires a coordinated statewide approach. This effort requires collaboration and leadership from the state board for community and technical colleges and the office of the superintendent of public instruction to ensure students can engage in all forms of dual credit opportunities that align with their career and academic interests.

3. Career and technical education dual credit is the most commonly accessed form of dual credit in Washington and has significant potential to improve equitable access to postsecondary pathways for students from all backgrounds. However, it lags behind other course-based dual credit programs in ensuring that students receive credit on their transcript while in high school, and that the credit they earn will transfer into the postsecondary institution of their choice.

4. Therefore, the legislature intends to streamline statewide and regional efforts that support students' dual credit access and attainment by increasing the collaboration between state and local partners, studying the feasibility of improving the state's dual credit administrative data management system, creating and encouraging the use of statewide articulation agreements for career and technical education dual credit courses, and receiving recommendations on future amendments to state dual credit policies.

## Section 2
1. The state board for community and technical colleges and the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall collaborate with the following entities to streamline statewide and regional efforts that support students' dual credit access and attainment: Educational services districts, participating institutions of higher education, skill centers established under chapter 28A.245 RCW, registered apprenticeship programs approved under chapter 49.04 RCW, public high schools, and school districts operating within the educational service district.

2. Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the statewide and regional efforts required by subsection (1) of this section must include the following activities:

    a. Developing, and updating annually, a comprehensive catalog of dual credit courses and programs offered to students enrolled in public high schools;

    b. Aligning career and technical education dual credit programs with postsecondary credential pathways and apprenticeships leading to in-demand career fields;

    c. Providing technical assistance to public high schools and institutions of higher education to improve the accuracy and speed of awarding dual credits and updating transcripts;

    d. Providing professional development for staff of public high schools and institutions of higher education to develop, align, and articulate dual credit courses; and

    e. Supporting public high school staff in the following activities:

        i. Outreach to prospective students and students who have completed career and technical education dual credit courses and are eligible for postsecondary credit about how to receive and where to apply the credit;

        ii. Providing technical assistance in course curriculum alignment for career and technical education dual credit courses;

        iii. Partnering with institutions of higher education to develop articulation agreements for career and technical education dual credit courses; and

        iv. Awarding equipment and supplies grants for career and technical education dual credit courses that meet emerging needs in high-demand, high-paying industries.

3. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:

    a. "Institution of higher education" has the same meaning as in RCW 28A.600.287.

    b. "Public high school" means a public school as defined in RCW 28A.150.010 with any of grades nine through 12.
