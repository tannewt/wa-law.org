<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that students who participate in dual credit programs have higher rates of college enrollment, persistence, and completion. Dual credit programs are an important element of economic development for Washington because they equip students with the skills needed for high-skill, high-wage employment and continued education in high-demand sectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strengthening dual credit programs and transitions from secondary to postsecondary education requires a coordinated statewide approach. This effort requires collaboration and leadership from the state board for community and technical colleges and the office of the superintendent of public instruction to ensure students can engage in all forms of dual credit opportunities that align with their career and academic interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Career and technical education dual credit is the most commonly accessed form of dual credit in Washington and has significant potential to improve equitable access to postsecondary pathways for students from all backgrounds. However, it lags behind other course-based dual credit programs in ensuring that students receive credit on their transcript while in high school, and that the credit they earn will transfer into the postsecondary institution of their choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to streamline statewide and regional efforts that support students' dual credit access and attainment by increasing the collaboration between state and local partners, studying the feasibility of improving the state's dual credit administrative data management system, creating and encouraging the use of statewide articulation agreements for career and technical education dual credit courses, and receiving recommendations on future amendments to state dual credit policies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
