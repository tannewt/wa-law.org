<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>There is a substantial underground economy in the construction industry in the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Underground economy practices, such as misclassifying employees as independent contractors, cost workers an estimated $142.6 million on average per year in wages and benefits between 2011 and 2021, according to a 2023 report by the Washington state institute for public policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State law establishes protections for employees to ensure they are paid wages fully and on time. However, current law does not include a mechanism for a worker employed by a subcontractor to seek payment of unpaid wages and benefits from upper-tier contractors.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to create additional mechanisms for workers to seek payment of wages and benefits owed to them when those wages and benefits are illegally withheld.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>An owner that enters into a construction contract with a direct contractor is jointly and severally liable with the direct contractor for any unpaid wages, including fringe benefit contributions, meal and rest periods, reimbursements, and damages, owed to any employee of the direct contractor and any employee of a subcontractor at any tier for labor performed on a project within the scope of the construction contract.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>An owner or direct contractor may not avoid liability under this section by claiming that a person performing labor on a project within the scope of a construction contract is an independent contractor rather than an employee of a direct contractor or subcontractor, unless the person qualifies as an independent contractor under chapter 49.46 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In any action brought under this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that a person performing labor on a project within the scope of a construction contract is an employee. The party claiming otherwise may rebut the presumption by establishing that the person qualifies as an independent contractor under chapter 49.46 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section impairs:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The right of an owner or direct contractor to bring an action against a subcontractor to seek recovery of actual and liquidated damages for the amounts paid by the owner or direct contractor for unpaid wages, including fringe benefit contributions, meal and rest periods, reimbursements, interest, double damages, noneconomic damages, attorney fees, expert witness fees, and incurred costs associated with an action brought under this section;</p>

</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>Any effort to use a person's immigration status to negatively impact a worker's wage and hour rights, responsibilities, or participation in proceedings under this section constitutes intimidation, coercion, discrimination, or retaliation in violation of subsection (11) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any violation of subsection (11) of this section entitles the employee, a third party acting on the employee's behalf, the attorney general, or the prosecuting attorney of any county to seek reinstatement, back pay, damages, attorney fees, and any other equitable relief deemed appropriate by the court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a direct contractor or subcontractor is found liable in a final judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction for a violation of this section, the department of labor and industries shall deny, suspend, or revoke the contractor's registration under chapter 18.27 RCW.</p>
