    d. Records regarding the infrastructure of a private entity submitted to elections officials are exempt from disclosure for a period of 25 years after the creation of the record when accompanied by an express statement that the record contains information about the private entity's infrastructure and public disclosure may increase risk to the integrity of election operations or infrastructure; and
