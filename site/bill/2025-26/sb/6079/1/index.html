<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the business of insurance is one affected by the public interest and that wildfire losses devastate Washington communities and infrastructure, contribute to increases and unpredictability in homeowner insurance rates, inhibit insurers from offering products in Washington's insurance market, cause extensive harm to the state economy, and necessitate unpredictable public expenditures that undermine state and local government operations and fiscal management.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that fire losses and the extent of devastating economic and community effects from wildfires can be significantly reduced through mitigation actions for insurable dwellings in accordance with wildfire prepared home and wildfire prepared neighborhood designation standards published by the insurance institute for business and home safety or a successor entity.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature concludes it is in the public interest to establish the strengthen Washington homes program, a grant program intended to assist and promote wildfire risk mitigation.</p>

<li>
<p>The commissioner must annually, on or before July 1st, calculate and bill each organization for the amount of the regulatory and insurance fraud surcharges. The surcharges are due and payable no later than July 15th of each year. However, if the necessary financial records are not available or if the amount of the legislative appropriation is not determined in time to carry out such calculations and bill the surcharges within the time specified, the commissioner may use the surcharge factors for the prior year as the basis for the surcharges and, if necessary, the commissioner may impose supplemental fees to fully and properly charge the organizations. Any organization failing to pay the surcharges by July 31st must pay the same penalties as the penalties for failure to pay taxes when due under RCW 48.14.060. The surcharges required by this section are in addition to all other taxes and fees now imposed or that may be subsequently imposed.</p>

<p>Each insurer may annually collect regulatory and insurance fraud surcharges remitted in preceding years by means of a policyholder surcharge on premiums charged for all kinds of insurance. The recoupment is at a uniform rate reasonably calculated to collect the regulatory and insurance fraud surcharges remitted by the insurer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an insurer fails to collect the entire amount of the recoupment in the first year under this section, it may repeat the recoupment procedure provided for in this subsection (7) in succeeding years until the regulatory and insurance fraud surcharges are fully collected or a de minimis amount remains uncollected. Any such de minimis amount may be collected as provided in (d) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amount and nature of any recoupment must be separately stated on either a billing or policy declaration sent to an insured. The amount of the recoupment must not be considered a premium for any purpose, including the premium tax or agents' commissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An insurer may elect not to collect the regulatory and insurance fraud surcharges from its insured. In such a case, the insurer may recoup the regulatory and insurance fraud surcharges through its rates, if the following requirements are met:</p>
<ol type="i">
