# SB 6079 - Wildfire mitigation grants

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6079-S.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that the business of insurance is one affected by the public interest and that wildfire losses devastate Washington communities and infrastructure, contribute to increases and unpredictability in homeowner insurance rates, inhibit insurers from offering products in Washington's insurance market, cause extensive harm to the state economy, and necessitate unpredictable public expenditures that undermine state and local government operations and fiscal management.

The legislature further finds that fire losses and the extent of devastating economic and community effects from wildfires can be significantly reduced through mitigation actions for insurable dwellings in accordance with wildfire prepared home and wildfire prepared neighborhood designation standards published by the insurance institute for business and home safety or a successor entity.

Therefore, the legislature concludes it is in the public interest to establish the strengthen Washington homes program, a grant program intended to assist and promote wildfire risk mitigation.

## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Insurable dwelling" means a dwelling located or situated on, or affixed to, residential real estate and includes a single-family or multifamily dwelling, including a modular home as defined in RCW 46.04.303.

2. "Program" means the strengthen Washington homes program established in section 3 of this act.

3. "Program account" means the strengthen Washington homes program account created in section 4 of this act.

4. "Wildfire prepared standards" means wildfire prepared home and wildfire prepared neighborhood designation standards published by the insurance institute for business and home safety or a successor entity.

## Section 3
1. The strengthen Washington homes program is hereby established for the purpose of providing financial grants to real property owners, building contractors, nonprofit organizations, and tribes to assist and promote wildfire risk mitigation efforts for insurable dwellings in accordance with the wildfire prepared standards.

2. To the extent funding is available in the program account, the commissioner shall implement and administer the program in accordance with this section.

3. The commissioner may accept any and all donations, bequests, gifts, conveyances, devises, and grants conditional or otherwise; or money, property, service, or other things of value which may be received from the United States or any agency thereof, any governmental agency, institution, person, firm, or corporation, public and private, to be held, used, or applied for the purpose of the program.

4. Any financial grant provided under the program to mitigate an insurable dwelling is contingent upon the real property owner securing all required permits and applicable inspections in accordance with applicable federal, state, local, and tribal building codes as well as a wildfire prepared standard or equivalent designation from the insurance institute for business and home safety or a successor entity.

5. Nothing in this section is construed to create an entitlement for property owners, building contractors, nonprofit organizations, or tribes to obtain funds for, or obligate the state in any way to fund, any activity for which a financial grant is permitted under this section.

## Section 4
1. The strengthen Washington homes program account is hereby created in the state treasury. Moneys in the program account may be spent only after appropriation. Expenditures from the program account may be used only for the purposes of the program. All receipts from the following sources must be deposited into the program account:

    a. All grants and funds received under this section for the purposes of the program; and

    b. Any appropriations made for the program by the legislature.

2. Any interest earned on money in the program account must remain in the program account.

## Section 5
1. The commissioner may conduct localized pilot projects to inform the implementation of the program. The pilot projects must include identification of the most efficient and equitable means of administering the program, development of the necessary workforce to implement the program fully, and establishment of the schedule for full implementation.

    a. The design of the pilot projects must be informed by the report submitted by the wildfire mitigation and resiliency standards work group created in section 1, chapter 324, Laws of 2025 including, but not limited to: Prioritizing projects in areas with high wildfire hazard, limited insurance access, low income areas, and underserved populations; funding mechanisms that consider financial accessibility and equity; and including a mechanism to evaluate effectiveness in reducing wildfire risk and insurance nonrenewals over time.

    b. The commissioner must engage nonprofit, local, state, tribal, and federal entities with local knowledge on best locations for pilot projects.

2. The commissioner shall submit, in compliance with RCW 43.01.036, results of the pilot projects by November 1, 2029, including: Reporting on how locations were determined; interactions with local workforce and property owners; types of mitigation provided by grant funding; how equity and access for underserved populations was considered in the design; and how the certification process went for the consumer.

## Section 6
The commissioner may adopt rules as necessary to implement this chapter, including to:

1. Establish application forms and procedures for obtaining a financial grant;

2. Specify the eligibility criteria, requirements, and procedures for obtaining a financial grant, which may include, but are not limited to, providing financial grants to:

4. Develop procedures and requirements for distributing financial grants; and

5. Collect the documentation necessary to allow for any auditing of the program that is required under the terms of a grant or other funds received by the program.

## Section 7
An insurer is prohibited from using wildfire risk as a disqualifying risk factor for eligibility of property insurance coverage if the property has a current wildfire prepared home, wildfire prepared neighbors, or an equivalent designation from the insurance institute for business and home safety or a successor entity. Nothing in this section prohibits the use of other risk factors when determining eligibility of property insurance coverage, including disqualifying coverage for nonwildfire risk.

## Section 8
This act may be known and cited as the strengthen Washington homes act.

## Section 10

    a. "Insurance fraud surcharge" means the fees imposed by subsection (2)(b) of this section.

    b. "Organization" means every insurer, as defined in RCW 48.01.050, having a certificate of authority to do business in this state, every health care service contractor, as defined in RCW 48.44.010, every health maintenance organization, as defined in RCW 48.46.020, or self‑funded multiple employer welfare arrangement, as defined in RCW 48.125.010, registered to do business in this state. "Class one" organizations consist of all insurers as defined in RCW 48.01.050. "Class two" organizations consist of all organizations registered under provisions of chapters 48.44 and 48.46 RCW. "Class three" organizations consist of self-funded multiple employer welfare arrangements as defined in RCW 48.125.010.

    c. [Empty]

        i. "Receipts" means (A) net direct premiums consisting of direct gross premiums, as defined in RCW 48.18.170, paid for insurance written or renewed upon risks or property resident, situated, or to be performed in this state, less return premiums and premiums on policies not taken, dividends paid or credited to policyholders on direct business, and premiums received from policies or contracts issued in connection with qualified plans as defined in RCW 48.14.021, and (B) prepayments to health care service contractors, as defined in RCW 48.44.010, health maintenance organizations, as defined in RCW 48.46.020, or participant contributions to self-funded multiple employer welfare arrangements, as defined in RCW 48.125.010, less experience rating credits, dividends, prepayments returned to subscribers, and payments for contracts not taken.

        ii. Participant contributions, under chapter 48.125 RCW, used to determine the receipts in this state under this section are determined in the same manner as premiums taxable in this state are determined under RCW 48.14.090.

    d. "Regulatory surcharge" means the fees imposed by subsection (2)(a) of this section.

2. The annual cost of operating the office of the insurance commissioner and the strengthen Washington homes program are determined by legislative appropriation.

    a. A pro rata share of the cost, except for the cost of the insurance fraud program, is charged to all organizations as a regulatory surcharge. Each class of organization must contribute a sufficient amount to the insurance commissioner's regulatory account to pay the reasonable costs, including overhead, of regulating that class of organization.

    b. The annual cost of operating the insurance fraud program is charged to all organizations as an insurance fraud surcharge. Each class of organization must contribute a sufficient amount to the insurance commissioner's fraud account to pay the reasonable costs of the program, including overhead.

3. [Empty]

    a. The regulatory surcharge is calculated separately for each class of organization. The regulatory surcharge collected from each organization is that portion of the cost of operating the insurance commissioner's office, except for the cost of operating the insurance fraud program, for that class of organization, for the ensuing fiscal year that is represented by the organization's portion of the receipts collected or received by all organizations within that class on business in this state during the previous calendar year. However, the regulatory surcharge must not exceed one-eighth of one percent of receipts and the minimum regulatory surcharge is one thousand dollars.

    b. The insurance fraud surcharge collected from each organization is the cost of operating the insurance fraud program for the ensuing fiscal year that is represented by the organization's portion of the receipts collected or received on business in this state during the previous calendar year. However, the insurance fraud surcharge may not exceed one one-hundredths of one percent of receipts and the minimum insurance fraud surcharge is one hundred dollars.

4. The commissioner must annually, on or before July 1st, calculate and bill each organization for the amount of the regulatory and insurance fraud surcharges. The surcharges are due and payable no later than July 15th of each year. However, if the necessary financial records are not available or if the amount of the legislative appropriation is not determined in time to carry out such calculations and bill the surcharges within the time specified, the commissioner may use the surcharge factors for the prior year as the basis for the surcharges and, if necessary, the commissioner may impose supplemental fees to fully and properly charge the organizations. Any organization failing to pay the surcharges by July 31st must pay the same penalties as the penalties for failure to pay taxes when due under RCW 48.14.060. The surcharges required by this section are in addition to all other taxes and fees now imposed or that may be subsequently imposed.

5. [Empty]

    a. All moneys collected for the regulatory surcharge must be deposited in the insurance commissioner's regulatory account in the state treasury which is hereby created.

    b. All moneys collected for the insurance fraud surcharge must be deposited in the insurance commissioner's fraud account in the state treasury which is hereby created.

6. Unexpended funds in the insurance commissioner's regulatory and fraud accounts at the close of a fiscal year are carried forward to the succeeding fiscal year and may be used to:

    a. Fund the strengthen Washington homes program account created in section 4 of this act until December 31, 2029; and

    b. Reduce future regulatory and insurance fraud surcharges.

7. [Empty]

    a. Each insurer may annually collect regulatory and insurance fraud surcharges remitted in preceding years by means of a policyholder surcharge on premiums charged for all kinds of insurance. The recoupment is at a uniform rate reasonably calculated to collect the regulatory and insurance fraud surcharges remitted by the insurer.

    b. If an insurer fails to collect the entire amount of the recoupment in the first year under this section, it may repeat the recoupment procedure provided for in this subsection (7) in succeeding years until the regulatory and insurance fraud surcharges are fully collected or a de minimis amount remains uncollected. Any such de minimis amount may be collected as provided in (d) of this subsection.

    c. The amount and nature of any recoupment must be separately stated on either a billing or policy declaration sent to an insured. The amount of the recoupment must not be considered a premium for any purpose, including the premium tax or agents' commissions.

    d. An insurer may elect not to collect the regulatory and insurance fraud surcharges from its insured. In such a case, the insurer may recoup the regulatory and insurance fraud surcharges through its rates, if the following requirements are met:

        i. The insurer remits the amount of the surcharges not collected by election under this subsection; and

        ii. The surcharges are not considered a premium for any purpose, including the premium tax or agents' commission.
