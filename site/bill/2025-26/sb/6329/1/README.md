# SB 6329 - Broadband internet

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6329.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature hereby finds and declares that access to high-speed broadband is a necessity and essential to participation in the economy, education, and civic life. Closing gaps in broadband availability is a matter of deployment, affordability, and ensuring networks are resilient, high quality, and facilitate public safety. Because voice over internet protocol has replaced traditional voice telephone service for a large segment of the population, ensuring its reliability is in the public interest and consistent with public safety goals. State regulators require unambiguous authority and a clear mandate to establish and enforce appropriate oversight and regulation of broadband and voice over internet protocol in order to meet the state's goals of universal, high quality, and affordable access.

## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

"Broadband service" does not include dial-up services.

2. "Internet service provider" means any person, business, or organization qualified to do business in this state that provides individuals, corporations, or other entities with the ability to connect to the internet with a broadband service.

3. "Jitter" means the variance in end-to-end delay of information traveling on a network. Jitter is measured through the difference between actual time of arrival and expected time of arrival.

4. "Latency" means the measure of time it takes in milliseconds, defined as either one-way or round trip, for a packet to travel from one point in a network to another.

5. "Packet loss" is defined as the event where sent information is not acknowledged by the receiver or it is received with a round trip latency delay that is greater than three seconds.

6. "Voice over internet protocol" or "VoIP" means an interconnected voice over internet protocol service that:

    a. Enables real-time two-way voice communications;

    b. Requires a broadband connection from the user's location;

    c. Requires internet protocol compatible customer premises equipment; and

    h. Minimum data collection and reporting requirements related to the deployment and availability of services, including pricing and adoption of VoIP and broadband services.

2. Based on complaints received or data collected from service providers, the utilities and transportation commission may conduct evaluations and audits of a provider's facilities and infrastructure used to provide broadband or VoIP services in order to evaluate service quality, public safety, or network resiliency.

3. The utilities and transportation commission may order a broadband service provider to undertake remedial actions if the utilities and transportation commission finds that the practices, facilities, or service of any broadband service provider are:

    a. Unjust, unreasonable, unsafe, improper, or inadequate to ensure network reliability, resiliency, and public safety; and

    b. Fail to meet the standards adopted by rule as required by subsection (1) of this section.

4. Beginning July 1, 2027, the utilities and transportation commission shall report annually to the appropriate committees of the legislature on progress toward achieving goals of resiliency, public safety, and quality of broadband and VoIP services.
