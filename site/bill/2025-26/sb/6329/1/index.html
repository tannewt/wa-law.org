<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature hereby finds and declares that access to high-speed broadband is a necessity and essential to participation in the economy, education, and civic life. Closing gaps in broadband availability is a matter of deployment, affordability, and ensuring networks are resilient, high quality, and facilitate public safety. Because voice over internet protocol has replaced traditional voice telephone service for a large segment of the population, ensuring its reliability is in the public interest and consistent with public safety goals. State regulators require unambiguous authority and a clear mandate to establish and enforce appropriate oversight and regulation of broadband and voice over internet protocol in order to meet the state's goals of universal, high quality, and affordable access.</p>
