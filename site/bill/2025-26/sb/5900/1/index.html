<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>To promote dignity and comfort for terminally ill patients while maintaining the integrity and safety of health care environments; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That hospitals, nursing homes, and hospice care centers develop policies consistent with existing Washington law regarding the medical use of cannabis that allow the medical use of cannabis by a qualifying patient with a terminal condition in the facility.</p>

The facility shall establish a policy that permits the medical use of cannabis by a qualifying patient and contains the following elements:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Prohibits smoking or vaping as a method of use, even if smoking or vaping is the qualifying patient's preferred and routine method of use;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires the qualifying patient's medical use of cannabis to be included in the patient's medical records;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires a qualifying patient with a terminal condition, as defined in RCW 70.122.020, to provide a copy of the patient's valid authorization;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires a qualifying patient or a qualifying patient's designated provider to be responsible for acquiring, administering, and removing medical cannabis;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires medical cannabis to be stored securely at all times in a locked container in the qualifying patient's room, other designated area, or with the qualifying patient's designated provider;</p>

<li>
<p>Prohibits health care professionals and facility staff, including, but not limited to, physicians, nurses, and pharmacists, from administering medical cannabis;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prohibits sharing medical cannabis between patients and visitors; and</p>

<p>Requires all remaining medical cannabis be removed by the qualifying patient or qualifying patient's designated provider upon patient discharge.

<li>
<p>If a federal regulatory agency, the United States department of justice, or the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services initiates an enforcement action against a hospital, nursing home, or hospice care center related to the facility's compliance with this section or issues a rule or other notification that expressly prohibits the medical use of cannabis in health care facilities, a hospital, nursing home, or hospice care center may suspend compliance with this section until the regulatory agency, the United States department of justice, or the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services notifies the facility that it may resume permitting the use of medical cannabis within the facility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(a) of this subsection does not permit a hospital, nursing home, or hospice care center to prohibit patient use of medical cannabis due solely to the fact that cannabis is a Schedule I drug pursuant to the federal uniform controlled substances act, or other federal constraints on the use of medicinal cannabis that were in existence prior to the effective date of this section.</p>
