# SB 5727 - Residential energy storage

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5727.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that it is in the public interest to increase energy storage capacity across the state in response to increases in peak electrical loads, wildfire potential, and windstorms and other catastrophic events that may lead to power outages. Residential battery energy storage systems will be a key part of the solution, but they must be connected to the grid and dispatchable by utilities during peak load events, and available to customers in the case of power outages. The initial cost of residential battery energy storage systems is a barrier for many light and power business customers. With a targeted incentive program, the state can aid utilities and their customers in the adoption of these systems with the goal of reducing costly transmission and distribution of capital expenditures; maximizing system benefits for all retail electric customers; and identifying opportunities for improving access to transformative technologies for low-income and moderate-income customers. Such incentive programs would help achieve clean energy transformation act goals.

## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout this section and sections 3 through 6 of this act unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Distributed energy resource" has the same meaning as in RCW 19.405.020.

2. "Low-income" has the same definition as in RCW 19.405.020.

3. "Moderate-income household" means a single person, family, or unrelated persons living together whose adjusted income is more than 80 percent but is at or below 115 percent of the median family income adjusted for family size, for the county, city, or metropolitan statistical area, where the project is located, as reported by the United States department of housing and urban development.

4. "Qualified light and power business" means a light and power business as defined in RCW 82.16.010 that has a battery incentive program as described in section 3 of this act that is approved by the Washington State University extension energy program.

5. "Qualified light and power business customer" means a residential customer, nonprofit organization, public entity, tribal government, or academic institution. A multifamily housing tax equity investor partnership may participate in the program if a nonprofit organization, public entity, tribal government, or academic institution is the controlling partner for that partnership.

6. "Residential battery energy storage system" means a stationary and permanently installed battery system that can store energy when production exceeds demand and release energy when energy demand increases. A residential battery energy storage system is not an industrial-scale battery energy storage system.

7. "Time-of-use rate" means an electricity billing structure where the price of electricity varies based on the time of day it is used, typically with higher prices during peak demand hours and lower prices during off-peak hours, intended to encourage consumers to shift their energy usage to less expensive periods.

8. "Virtual power plant" means an aggregation of connected distributed energy resources that can balance electrical loads and are coordinated to work together to provide utility grid services like a traditional power plant.

## Section 3
1. A qualified light and power business must have a battery incentive program approved by the Washington State University extension energy program to provide a battery incentive to customers as described in section 4 of this act and to receive tax credits for providing such an incentive as described in section 5 of this act.

2. A qualified light and power business battery incentive program must include:

    a. A battery incentive payment for a qualified light and power business customer; and

    b. A plan for how the qualified light and power business will use the customer batteries by:

        i. Allowing retail time-of-use rates for qualified light and power business customers who own batteries or other customer self-generation by July 1, 2026. A time-of-use rate may not reduce the compensation rate for energy exported by a qualified light and power business customer or discharged energy from the customer's residential battery energy storage system or reduce the compensation rate due to the location of the customer in the light and power business' service territory; or

        ii. Incorporating the batteries into a utility-operated virtual power plant that financially encourages qualified light and power business customers to manage their electricity use to their benefit so the utility can effectively manage the batteries collectively to benefit utility grid operations.

3. A light and power business must submit an application to establish a battery incentive program to the Washington State University extension energy program, and the Washington State University extension energy program must evaluate whether to approve the application based on whether the program as described in the application meets the requirements for battery incentives in section 4 of this act and the requirements in this section, including:

    a. At least 40 percent of the battery incentive program must benefit low-income households and moderate-income households, low-income service providers, housing authorities, or tribal governments;

    b. An application must be included for qualified light and power business customers to apply for the battery incentive, which must require income verification for low-income and moderate-income customers. Income verification may be performed by low-income service providers, housing authorities, or tribal governments on behalf of a light and power business;

    c. Leases to customers are not authorized;

    d. The time-of-use rate or virtual power plant must be used by the qualified light and power business customer to lower the customer's current total annual light and power expenses;

    e. All expenses and upgrades proposed as part of program implementation are documented; and

    f. A qualified light and power business may not sell or aggregate qualified light and power business customer data for any purposes beyond the direct operation of the battery incentive program.

4. A qualified light and power business may establish residential battery energy storage system installer partners and equipment specifications for the business' battery storage program.

5. If the Washington State University extension energy program approves a light and power business battery incentive program application, the qualified light and power business may commence such a program. The Washington State University extension energy program must audit a qualified light and power business' program at least once every two years to verify that the program is implemented according to the requirements outlined in this act.

6. The department of commerce must produce nonbinding recommendations for light and power businesses for help in designing virtual power plants for a battery incentive program. These recommendations must be made public on the department of commerce's website by December 1, 2025.

7. A light and power business with more than 100,000 retail electric customers in Washington must implement a battery incentive program in accordance with this section. All other light and power businesses may choose to implement a battery incentive program.

## Section 4
1. [Empty]

    a. A qualified light and power business customer may apply to the customer's light and power business for a one-time battery incentive between July 1, 2026, and June 30, 2036, for the kilowatt-hours of installed storage from a residential battery energy storage system. A qualified light and power business customer must be connected to a qualified light and power business time-of-use program or virtual power plant to receive an incentive payment.

    b. The battery incentive will be paid in the following amounts, unless the requests exceed the amount authorized for credit to the participating light and power business:

        ii. Achievement of an improved national ranking for battery energy storagerelated employment, as reported in a nationally recognized report.

5. In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review, the joint legislative audit and review committee may refer to any data collected by the state.

6. [Empty]

    a. The Washington State University extension energy program must collect, through the application process, data from persons claiming the tax credit under section 5 of this act and persons receiving the incentive payments created in section 4 of this act, as necessary, and may collect data from other interested persons as necessary to report on the performance of this act including, but not limited to:

        i. The number of participants, size of the storage systems installed, and dollars spent on incentives; and

        ii. Energy storage program load flexibility and demand response events.

    b. Names and addresses of persons receiving the incentive payments are not subject to disclosure under chapter 42.56 RCW.

7. All recipients of tax credits or incentive payments awarded under this chapter must provide data necessary to evaluate the tax preference performance objectives in this section as requested by the Washington State University extension energy program or the joint legislative audit and review committee. Failure to comply may result in the loss of a tax credit award or incentive payment in the following year.
