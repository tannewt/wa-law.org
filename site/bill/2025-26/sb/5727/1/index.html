<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that it is in the public interest to increase energy storage capacity across the state in response to increases in peak electrical loads, wildfire potential, and windstorms and other catastrophic events that may lead to power outages. Residential battery energy storage systems will be a key part of the solution, but they must be connected to the grid and dispatchable by utilities during peak load events, and available to customers in the case of power outages. The initial cost of residential battery energy storage systems is a barrier for many light and power business customers. With a targeted incentive program, the state can aid utilities and their customers in the adoption of these systems with the goal of reducing costly transmission and distribution of capital expenditures; maximizing system benefits for all retail electric customers; and identifying opportunities for improving access to transformative technologies for low-income and moderate-income customers. Such incentive programs would help achieve clean energy transformation act goals.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>The definitions in this section apply throughout this section and sections 3 through 6 of this act unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&quot;Distributed energy resource&quot; has the same meaning as in RCW 19.405.020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Low-income&quot; has the same definition as in RCW 19.405.020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Moderate-income household&quot; means a single person, family, or unrelated persons living together whose adjusted income is more than 80 percent but is at or below 115 percent of the median family income adjusted for family size, for the county, city, or metropolitan statistical area, where the project is located, as reported by the United States department of housing and urban development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Qualified light and power business&quot; means a light and power business as defined in RCW 82.16.010 that has a battery incentive program as described in section 3 of this act that is approved by the Washington State University extension energy program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Qualified light and power business customer&quot; means a residential customer, nonprofit organization, public entity, tribal government, or academic institution. A multifamily housing tax equity investor partnership may participate in the program if a nonprofit organization, public entity, tribal government, or academic institution is the controlling partner for that partnership.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Residential battery energy storage system&quot; means a stationary and permanently installed battery system that can store energy when production exceeds demand and release energy when energy demand increases. A residential battery energy storage system is not an industrial-scale battery energy storage system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Time-of-use rate&quot; means an electricity billing structure where the price of electricity varies based on the time of day it is used, typically with higher prices during peak demand hours and lower prices during off-peak hours, intended to encourage consumers to shift their energy usage to less expensive periods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Virtual power plant&quot; means an aggregation of connected distributed energy resources that can balance electrical loads and are coordinated to work together to provide utility grid services like a traditional power plant.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A qualified light and power business must have a battery incentive program approved by the Washington State University extension energy program to provide a battery incentive to customers as described in section 4 of this act and to receive tax credits for providing such an incentive as described in section 5 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A qualified light and power business battery incentive program must include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A battery incentive payment for a qualified light and power business customer; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A plan for how the qualified light and power business will use the customer batteries by:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Allowing retail time-of-use rates for qualified light and power business customers who own batteries or other customer self-generation by July 1, 2026. A time-of-use rate may not reduce the compensation rate for energy exported by a qualified light and power business customer or discharged energy from the customer's residential battery energy storage system or reduce the compensation rate due to the location of the customer in the light and power business' service territory; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorporating the batteries into a utility-operated virtual power plant that financially encourages qualified light and power business customers to manage their electricity use to their benefit so the utility can effectively manage the batteries collectively to benefit utility grid operations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A light and power business must submit an application to establish a battery incentive program to the Washington State University extension energy program, and the Washington State University extension energy program must evaluate whether to approve the application based on whether the program as described in the application meets the requirements for battery incentives in section 4 of this act and the requirements in this section, including:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>At least 40 percent of the battery incentive program must benefit low-income households and moderate-income households, low-income service providers, housing authorities, or tribal governments;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An application must be included for qualified light and power business customers to apply for the battery incentive, which must require income verification for low-income and moderate-income customers. Income verification may be performed by low-income service providers, housing authorities, or tribal governments on behalf of a light and power business;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leases to customers are not authorized;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The time-of-use rate or virtual power plant must be used by the qualified light and power business customer to lower the customer's current total annual light and power expenses;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All expenses and upgrades proposed as part of program implementation are documented; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A qualified light and power business may not sell or aggregate qualified light and power business customer data for any purposes beyond the direct operation of the battery incentive program.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A qualified light and power business may establish residential battery energy storage system installer partners and equipment specifications for the business' battery storage program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the Washington State University extension energy program approves a light and power business battery incentive program application, the qualified light and power business may commence such a program. The Washington State University extension energy program must audit a qualified light and power business' program at least once every two years to verify that the program is implemented according to the requirements outlined in this act.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>As part of its 2030 tax preference reviews, the joint legislative audit and review committee must review the tax preference in section 4 of this act. The legislature intends for the legislative auditor to determine that the incentive has achieved its desired outcomes if the following objectives are achieved:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Installation of 50 megawatt-hours of battery energy storage by participants in the battery incentive program between July 1, 2026, and June 30, 2036; and</p>
