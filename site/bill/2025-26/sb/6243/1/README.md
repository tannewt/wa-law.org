## Section 1
The definitions in this section apply throughout this section and sections 2 through 12 of this act unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Automated driving system" means the hardware and software that are collectively capable of performing the entire dynamic driving task on a sustained basis, regardless of whether it is limited to a specific operational design domain.

2. "Autonomous motor vehicle" means a motor vehicle equipped with an automated driving system designed to function as a level three system when the automated driving system is engaged, four system, or five system under the society of automotive engineers international standard J3016, as it existed on the effective date of this section.

3. "Dynamic driving task" means all of the real-time operational and tactical functions required to operate a vehicle in on-road traffic, excluding the strategic functions such as trip scheduling and selection of destinations and waypoints, and including:

    a. Lateral vehicle motion control via steering;

    b. Longitudinal motion control via acceleration and deceleration;

    c. Monitoring the driving environment via object and event detection, recognition, classification, and response preparation;

    d. Object and event response execution;

    e. Maneuver planning; and

    f. Enhancing conspicuity via lighting, signaling, and gesturing.

4. "Dynamic driving task fallback" means the response by the person or human driver to either perform the dynamic driving task or achieve a minimal risk condition after the occurrence of any dynamic driving task performance-relevant system failure or upon operational design domain exit, or the response by an automated driving system to achieve minimal risk condition, given the same circumstances.

5. "Human driver" means a natural person in the vehicle with a valid driver's license to operate a motor vehicle who controls all or part of the dynamic driving task.

6. "Minimal risk condition" means a stable, stopped condition to which a person, human driver, or an automated driving system may bring a vehicle after performing the dynamic driving task fallback in order to reduce the risk of a crash when a given trip cannot or should not be completed.

7. "On-demand autonomous vehicle network" means a transportation service network that uses a software application or other digital means to dispatch or otherwise enable the prearrangement of transportation with autonomous motor vehicles for purposes of transporting passengers or goods, including for-hire transportation and transportation of passengers or goods for compensation.

8. "Operational design domain" means operating conditions under which a given automated driving system is specifically designed to function including, but not limited to, environmental, geographical, and time-of-day restrictions, or the requisite presence or absence of certain traffic or roadway characteristics.

9. "Person" means a natural person, corporation, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, limited liability company, association, joint venture, governmental agency, public corporation, or any other legal or commercial entity.

10. "Request to intervene" means an alert or notification by an automated driving system to a human driver, that the human driver should promptly begin or resume performance of part or all of the dynamic driving task.

## Section 2
1. A person may operate an autonomous motor vehicle on the public roadways of this state when the automated driving system is engaged only if such vehicle meets the following conditions:

    a. If a failure of the automated driving system occurs that renders that system unable to perform the entire dynamic driving task relevant to its intended operational design domain, the autonomous motor vehicle achieves a minimal risk condition or, if the failure occurs in a vehicle with an automated driving system that is a level three system under the society of automotive engineers international standard J3016, as it existed on the effective date of this section, the automated driving system must issue a request to intervene;

    b. The autonomous motor vehicle is capable of operating in compliance with the applicable traffic and motor vehicle safety laws and rules under this title when reasonable to do so, unless an exemption has been granted by the department;

    c. When required by federal law, the autonomous motor vehicle displays the required manufacturer's certification label indicating that at the time of its manufacture it has been certified to be in compliance with all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards, including reference to any exemption granted by the national highway traffic safety administration; and

    d. The autonomous motor vehicle is covered by liability insurance under section 4 of this act.

2. [Empty]

    a. In addition to satisfying the requirements of subsection (1) of this section, a person may operate an autonomous motor vehicle on the public roadways of this state when the automated driving system is engaged if:

No state agency, political subdivision, municipality, or local entity may prohibit the operation of autonomous motor vehicles, automated driving systems, or on-demand autonomous vehicle networks, or otherwise enact or keep in force rules or ordinances that would impose taxes, fees, or other requirements, including performance standards, specific to the operation of autonomous motor vehicles, automated driving systems, or on-demand autonomous vehicle networks in addition to the requirements of this chapter.

3. This section does not limit or preempt the existing authority of a municipality or other local government to regulate, license, or tax transportation network companies, ride-hail services, or other for-hire passenger services utilizing nonautonomous motor vehicles, or to manage the use of public rights-of-way, consistent with state law.

4. This chapter does not exempt the in-state purchase of autonomous motor vehicles from the requirements of chapter 46.96 RCW, where such requirements apply to all motor vehicles.

## Section 12
1. [Empty]

    a. If the department determines that an autonomous motor vehicle operating under an authorization issued under section 2(2) of this act is not in safe operational condition and the operation of the vehicle on public roadways of the state endangers the public, the department must provide to the authorization holder a notice of intent to:

        i. Suspend, revoke, or cancel the authorization; or

        ii. Impose restrictions on the operation of the vehicle.

        ii. Promptly notify the authorization holder of the decision.

    b. Within 10 days of receiving a notice of a decision issued under (a) of this subsection, an authorization holder may submit a written request to the department for review of the decision. Within 10 days of the department receiving such a request for review, the department must review the decision and issue a final determination to the authorization holder either upholding or rescinding the decision.

    c. If the department upholds the decision under (b) of this subsection, an authorization holder may submit a written request for a hearing. Such a request must be submitted within 10 days of the department issuing a final determination. The department must set a hearing date within 10 days of the hearing request and provide the authorization holder, the manufacturer of the autonomous motor vehicle, and the manufacturer of the automated driving system the opportunity to present evidence at the hearing. The hearing must be conducted by an administrative law judge within the office of administrative hearings and be conducted within 30 days of the department issuing a final determination. If a hearing is not held within such time period, the authorization issued under section 2(2) of this act must be automatically reinstated or the restriction imposed automatically removed, as applicable.

5. The department must promptly rescind an authorization suspension, revocation, or cancellation or remove an imposed restriction on operation of the autonomous motor vehicle if the authorization holder satisfies the requirements under subsection (3)(a) of this section.
