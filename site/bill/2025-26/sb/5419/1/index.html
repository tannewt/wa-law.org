<p>Unless actual malice, fraud, or bad faith is shown, an insurer is immune from liability in any civil action or suit arising from its (i) report of information to law enforcement and the insurance commissioner pursuant to this subsection (2), or (ii) cooperation with a duly issued subpoena for a criminal investigation or prosecution.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

Neither the insurance commissioner, staff of the office of the insurance commissioner, nor anyone receiving or processing information pursuant to this section is permitted or required to testify in any private civil action concerning any information that is confidential and privileged under this subsection (3).

</li>
<li>
<p>Rating bureaus may use the information shared under (a) of this subsection to analyze and inform rating classifications, so long as they do not publicly disclose, other than to rating subscribers, information that contains personally identifiable information about property owners, policyholders, losses, claimants, claims, or properties, other than aggregated by zip code or fire district boundary.</p>

Nothing in this section is intended to modify criminal investigative procedures or prosecutions or any authority, process, right, or obligation related to them.</p>

<p>When an insurer has reason to believe that a fire loss reported to the insurer may be of other than accidental cause, the insurer shall notify the insurance commissioner, in the manner prescribed under RCW 48.05.320 concerning the circumstances of the fire loss, including any and all relevant material developed from the insurer's inquiry into the fire loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notification of the insurance commissioner under subsection (1) of this section does not relieve the insurer of the duty to respond to a request for information from any other authorized agency and does not bar an insurer from other reporting under RCW 48.50.030(2).</p>
