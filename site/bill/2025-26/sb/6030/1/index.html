<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that chapter 70A.530 RCW was passed with the intent to reduce plastic waste and litter. A study completed by Washington State University pursuant to RCW 70A.530.060 examined the effects of chapter 70A.530 RCW passed in 2020. The Washington State University researchers came to the following conclusions:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>While the number of plastic carryout bags used in Washington decreased by 50 percent, the overall use of plastic by weight increased by 17 percent;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pass-through fee collected by retailers for providing carryout bags to customers is not sufficient to cover the costs of thicker plastic bags; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consumers are not reusing reusable carryout bags at a rate high enough to justify the increased costs of thicker plastic bags, both financial and environmental.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to implement the recommendations given by the Washington State University research team by:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Removing the requirement for retailers to provide &quot;reusable carryout bags,&quot; meaning retailers will be allowed to offer plastic carryout bags less than 2.25 mils to customers; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintaining the requirement for carryout bags, including plastic bags to contain at least 40 percent postconsumer recycled content that is currently imposed on retailers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
