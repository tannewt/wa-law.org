# SB 6030 - Plastic carryout bags

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6030.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that chapter 70A.530 RCW was passed with the intent to reduce plastic waste and litter. A study completed by Washington State University pursuant to RCW 70A.530.060 examined the effects of chapter 70A.530 RCW passed in 2020. The Washington State University researchers came to the following conclusions:

    a. While the number of plastic carryout bags used in Washington decreased by 50 percent, the overall use of plastic by weight increased by 17 percent;

    b. The pass-through fee collected by retailers for providing carryout bags to customers is not sufficient to cover the costs of thicker plastic bags; and

    c. Consumers are not reusing reusable carryout bags at a rate high enough to justify the increased costs of thicker plastic bags, both financial and environmental.

2. It is the intent of the legislature to implement the recommendations given by the Washington State University research team by:

    a. Removing the requirement for retailers to provide "reusable carryout bags," meaning retailers will be allowed to offer plastic carryout bags less than 2.25 mils to customers; and

    b. Maintaining the requirement for carryout bags, including plastic bags to contain at least 40 percent postconsumer recycled content that is currently imposed on retailers.

## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

## Section 3
1. A retail establishment may not provide to a customer or a person at an event

a paper carryout bag that does not meet the requirements of subsection (5)(a) of this section or a  carryout bag made of film plastic that does not meet recycled content requirements

    b. A retail establishment may not use or provide polyethylene or other noncompostable plastic bags for bagging of customer products in stores, as carryout bags, or for home delivery that do not meet the requirements for noncompostable products and film bags in chapter 70A.455 RCW.
