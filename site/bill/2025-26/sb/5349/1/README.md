Receipt under this subsection (2)(f) is not "distribution" under this chapter. A person who legally receives an assault weapon under this subsection (2)(f) may not sell or transfer the assault weapon to any other person in this state other than to a licensed dealer, to a federally licensed gunsmith for the purpose of service or repair, or to a law enforcement agency for the purpose of permanently relinquishing the assault weapon.
