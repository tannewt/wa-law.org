# SB 5887 - Transfers to charities

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5887.pdf)

## Section 1
This act may be known and cited as the charitable organizations privacy protection act.

## Section 2
The legislature finds that charitable organizations play a vital role in serving the people of Washington and that they are often named as beneficiaries in nonprobate instruments such as life insurance policies, retirement accounts, and other beneficiary designations.

The legislature further finds that these organizations have faced unnecessary administrative delays and improper requests for personal information unrelated to the transfer of property.

It is the intent of the legislature to protect the privacy of individuals affiliated with charitable organizations, to promote efficient transfers of property to charitable beneficiaries, and to ensure that the intent of decedents who make charitable gifts through beneficiary designations is fulfilled.
