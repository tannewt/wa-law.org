<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that reducing barriers to enrollment in early learning programs and public schools will increase enrollment  and well-being for students and families. The legislature finds that fees to obtain vital records, including birth certificates, present a burden to families earning lower incomes. The legislature therefore resolves to improve access to education services by waiving fees to obtain birth certificates for families receiving certain types of public assistance and allowing alternative forms of documentation for enrollment.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
