# SB 5105 - Sexually explicit depictions

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5105-S.E.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and other digital tools have enabled users to easily create or alter images in a realistic manner, resulting in the widespread proliferation of fabricated depictions that are virtually indistinguishable from authentic images.

The legislature further finds that images of child sexual abuse have been reported in training datasets for artificial intelligence image generation, and that artificial intelligence and other digital tools are increasingly capable of generating realistic images of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct.

The legislature further finds that artificial intelligence and other digital tools have introduced significant barriers to the detection and prosecution of crimes involving depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct, including by contributing to the increased volume of child sexual abuse material available online, facilitating the alteration of real images of child sexual abuse to evade conventional detection methods, and subverting conventional digital detection tools such as hash match identification.

The legislature further finds that even where a fabricated depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct does not depict an identifiable victim, exposure to such material may nonetheless desensitize the creator and viewers to the sexual exploitation and abuse of minors, distort perceptions of healthy sexuality and relationships, and increase the likelihood of future victimization.

The legislature further finds that it has a legitimate and compelling interest in preventing the sexual exploitation and abuse of children, and that even fabricated depictions of such conduct are patently offensive and may be regulated without infringing on constitutionally protected activity.

Therefore, the legislature intends to expand Washington's existing prohibitions against fabricated depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct to include circumstances where the depicted minor is not identifiable.

Nothing in chapter 227, Laws of 2010 is intended to in any way affect or diminish the immunity afforded an electronic communication service provider, remote computing service provider, or domain name registrar acting in the performance of its reporting or preservation responsibilities under 18 U.S.C. Secs. 2258a, 2258b, or 2258c.

6. In a prosecution under RCW 9.68A.070 or 9.68A.075, it shall be an affirmative defense that:

        i. He or she was engaged in a research activity;

        ii. The research activity was specifically approved prior to the possession or viewing activity being conducted in writing by a person, or other such entity vested with the authority to grant such approval by the institution of higher education; and

        iii. Viewing or possessing the visual or printed matter is an essential component of the authorized research; or

    b. The defendant was an employee of the Washington state legislature engaged in research at the request of a member of the legislature and:

        i. The request for research is made prior to the possession or viewing activity being conducted in writing by a member of the legislature;

7. In a prosecution under RCW 9.68A.050, 9.68A.053, 9.68A.060, 9.68A.070, or 9.68A.075 where the charged offense involves a fabricated depiction, the state is not required to establish that the minor depicted actually exists. It is not a defense that the defendant lacked knowledge of whether the fabricated depiction had been created or altered by digitization, or that the defendant lacked knowledge of whether the minor depicted actually exists. For the purposes of this subsection (7), "fabricated depiction" has the same meaning as defined in RCW 9.68A.011(2)(b).

8. Nothing in this section authorizes otherwise unlawful viewing or possession of visual or printed matter depicting a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct.

    d. Knowingly causes a minor to be photographed or part of a live performance which depicts the minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct where the minor is unconscious or unaware of the photograph or recording.

2. Sexual exploitation of a minor is a class B felony punishable under chapter 9A.20 RCW.

## Section 10
1. A person who, in the course of processing or producing visual or printed matter as part of an action to prevent, detect, protect against, report, or respond to the production, generation, incorporation, or synthesization through artificial intelligence of fabricated depictions, has reasonable cause to believe that the visual or printed matter depicts a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct shall immediately report such incident, or cause a report to be made, to the proper law enforcement agency. Persons failing to do so are guilty of a gross misdemeanor.

2. A person who makes a report in good faith under this section is immune from criminal liability resulting from the report.

## Section 11
(1) Prosecutions for criminal offenses shall not be commenced after the periods prescribed in this section.

## Section 12
If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.
