<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington's current recycling system does not collect and recycle the majority of the 3.8 billion glass, plastic, and metal beverage containers put onto the market each year to their highest and best use in order to optimize the economic and environmental benefits of recycling for Washington residents.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes improved recycling for beverage containers will help the state to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce litter and specifically plastic pollution, expand opportunities for reusable containers, and support state and regional businesses to build a circular economy. Higher-quality materials always hold greater economic value and offer more diverse end markets. The recent struggles of regional end markets expose critical weaknesses in Washington's fragmented recycling system and underscore the urgent need for comprehensive reforms to divert recyclable materials, like glass, from landfills and ensure they are transformed into valuable new products. Recycling refund programs provide a proven solution by delivering high quality, source separated glass, plastic, and metal containers that will revitalize end markets and support robust local recycling infrastructure.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that by enacting a recycling refund program for glass, plastic, and metal beverage containers within an extended producer responsibility framework has been shown to be the most effective method for the recovery, reuse, and recycling of beverage containers and all packaging waste. By increasing recovery rates for beverage containers, these systems will help companies who manufacture these products meet recycled content goals and reduce their environmental footprint.</p>
<p>Recycling refund programs in other states have proven to drive up recycling rates by providing a direct financial incentive for residents to return used containers. In addition, these systems also have proven to reduce litter. Packaging pollution remains a significant issue in Washington, with over 11.6 million pounds of litter entering public parks annually and more than 26,000,000 pounds accumulating along roadsides. Despite spending $12,000,000 annually on cleanup efforts, only a fraction of the problem is addressed. In contrast, states with recycling refund programs have reported reductions in beverage container litter by up to 84 percent, while achieving recovery rates for plastic bottles that are 3.5 times higher than states without such programs—an essential step in preventing ocean plastics and other environmental harm.</p>
<p>The legislature intends for recycling refunds to play a pivotal role in contributing to cleaner communities, a healthier recycling ecosystem, and stronger domestic manufacturing and circular economy.</p>
