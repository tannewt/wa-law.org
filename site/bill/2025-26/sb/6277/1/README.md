    b. A parent of the child must provide proof of official military orders or documentation by their military commander of the directed move.

        iii. Any federal government housing or off-base military housing, including off‑base military housing that may be provided through a public‑private venture.

2. A school district shall accept, on a conditional basis, an application for enrollment and course registration, including enrollment in a specific school or program within the school district, prior to the military family arriving in the state, by electronic or other means for children of military families who meet the requirements of subsection (1)(a) of this section.
