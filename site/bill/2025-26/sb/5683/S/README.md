[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5683-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that timeliness of payment and administrative burden related to obtaining payment from health insurance carriers, health plans, and managed care organizations are contributing factors to the financial vulnerability for health care providers and health care facilities, and the care available for patients is negatively impacted due to delays in payment.

2. It is the intent of the legislature to increase transparency regarding timeliness of claims payment by health insurance carriers, health plans, and managed care organizations by requiring carriers to report to the office of the insurance commissioner and the health care authority metrics related to timeliness of payment and for the office of the insurance commissioner and the health care authority to report the information in a public manner.
