<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that surveillance technologies currently utilized by house-banked card rooms licensed by the Washington state gambling commission must be modernized to leverage advancements in technology that enhance the safety and security of patrons, employees, and businesses. Outdated systems fail to provide the level of oversight, efficiency, and accountability required to address modern security challenges effectively.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that centralized surveillance systems for entities operating multiple locations offer significant benefits. These systems streamline operations, reduce redundancies, and ensure the consistent application of security protocols across all sites. Centralized platforms allow management to monitor multiple locations in real time from a single hub, improving oversight, enhancing accountability, and ensuring compliance with safety and regulatory standards.</p>
<p>Moreover, the legislature recognizes that modernized surveillance systems play a critical role in preventing criminal activities, identifying potential hazards, and resolving safety issues swiftly. High-quality video footage collected through centralized systems not only supports timely investigations but also provides clear and actionable evidence for enforcement, improving the integrity and trustworthiness of the regulatory process.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to empower card room operators with multiple locations to adopt centralized surveillance systems, ensuring that regulatory frameworks evolve to meet the demands of modern technology, strengthen public and workplace safety, and uphold fair and transparent business practices.</p>

<p>Any house-banked or class F card room being monitored by a centralized surveillance monitoring location must have a closed-circuit television system on their premises and adhere to all applicable rules.</p>
<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
<p>Centralized surveillance monitoring locations must:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Be located on the licensed premises of a house-banked card room;</p>
</li>

</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-6">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6">¶</a></h2>
<p>The licensee who houses the centralized surveillance monitoring location must ensure that at least two surveillance department employees are present in the room and monitoring activities whenever one or more monitored house-banked card rooms are conducting gambling and during the count process. In addition, the licensee must:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Control access to the room so that only licensed surveillance department employees use the room. Approved supervisory or management personnel may also enter the room to review activities, but only if they are licensed at each house-banked card room the centralized surveillance monitoring location monitors; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have at least one surveillance department employee for every 15 house-banked gambling tables open for play with at least one dedicated surveillance department employee to observe the transporting of drop boxes of a house-banked card room or when the count takes place. For example, if there are seven house-banked card rooms being monitored with 45 house-banked gambling tables open for play then three surveillance department employees would be required. However, if there were also four soft counts taking place at the same time, at least four surveillance department employees would be required in the room.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-7">Section 7 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7">¶</a></h2>
<p>Licensed locations that house a centralized surveillance monitoring location must ensure that:</p>

<p>Amounts of the wager;</p>
</li>
<li>

</ol>
<h2 id="section-8">Section 8 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-8">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the event that the centralized surveillance monitoring location is unable to view any camera that covers required gambling areas at a monitored house-banked card room, the following conditions must be met:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The licensed location must immediately notify supervisory personnel at the monitored house-banked card room;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The monitored house-banked card room must shut down gambling operations in specific areas of the card room not covered by a required camera until the camera feed is restored. Alternatively, if the onsite surveillance room is capable of viewing the required camera, the monitored house-banked card room may operate in the specific area once a licensed employee, as approved in the internal controls, staffs the surveillance room. For example, if a gambling table is not covered by a surveillance camera, the monitored house-banked card room must shut down the gambling table but may continue to operate other gambling tables at the card room where the surveillance system is operational;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The centralized surveillance monitoring location must document the disruptions in a malfunction log in the format determined by the commission; and</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each camera view and required saved video files at a monitored house-banked card room must be capable of having its video picture displayed on all video monitors at a centralized surveillance monitoring location.</p>
