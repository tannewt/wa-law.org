<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic spanning multiple years many persons, companies, and governments lost huge sums of income and reserves through job loss, loss of employees, added expenses, and interruptions in their ability to conduct their trade for extended periods. In contrast, many health insurance companies reported enormous profits during this time and used those profits to take advantage of stock buybacks and increase CEO and executive pay, and rather than passing on those profits to their policyholders in the form of reduced premiums and increased benefits they instead continued to lobby elected officials and governments for increases in insurance premium rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The voters of the state of Washington require immediate action to be assured that funds collected by their health insurance companies will be used for the health care needs of policyholders.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Policyholder&quot; means a person or group of persons who have entered into a contractual arrangement or on whose behalf a contractual arrangement has been entered into with a health insurance company to receive health care services.</p>

</li>
</ol>
