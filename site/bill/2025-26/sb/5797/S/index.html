<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that it is the state's paramount duty to amply provide every child in the state with an education, including children who qualify for special education services, creating the opportunity for each child to succeed in school and achieve success in life. The legislature further recognizes that not only our Constitution, but our conscience, call on us to ensure that all Washington children are prepared for a successful future through access to a high quality public education. Historical education reform efforts have been ongoing since 2009 with an emphasis on creating a fully funded system that is student-focused, supports all students, and fosters diversity, equity, and a welcoming classroom in every school. The legislature recognizes we are not done. The legislature acknowledges the most important priority and challenge we still face is fully funding all of our basic education obligations, including the costs associated with serving the needs of students with disabilities and the growing daily operating costs of districts. Meeting this challenge is paramount. The legislature also finds that cuts to essential services, including health care and other programs that protect the safety and well-being of the public, as well as social services protecting our most vulnerable residents, often impact programs that provide holistic services for children and their families and ultimately undermine our students' ability to arrive at the classroom ready to learn. It is the legislature's intent to meet our constitutional obligation and follow through on the promises we have made to Washington's 1,100,000 school children by raising new progressive revenue for our public schools, ensuring our students have the resources and tools necessary for success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus, the legislature intends to diversify our state's revenue sources to include taxing certain financial intangible assets that have historically been fully exempted from the tax code; assets that are often the key drivers of wealth inequality in our state. The legislature intends to levy a wealth tax of $0.34 on every $1,000 of the true and fair value of certain financial intangible assets, such as stocks and bonds, while exempting retirement savings, college savings, and ownership interests in private companies and partnerships. Additionally, to continue to make progress toward the state having a fair and balanced tax system that works for all residents, the legislature intends to exempt up to $50,000,000 in true and fair value of taxable financial intangible assets. Revenues generated from this tax will be dedicated to the education legacy trust account for the support of public schools, early learning, child care, and higher education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, the legislature finds that more progress is needed for the state to have a fair and balanced tax system that can provide sustainable, ample funding for public schools and other essential public programs and services. Washington's tax system remains the second most regressive in the nation as it asks those with the least to pay the most as a percentage of their income. Low-income Washingtonians pay at least three times more in state and local taxes as a percentage of their income than the state's highest-income households. By exempting up to $50,000,000 in true and fair value of taxable financial intangible assets, this tax is estimated to impact just 4,300 Washingtonians, taking a significant step toward reducing the disproportionate reliance on low and middle-income households to fund public schools as we strive to meet our state's paramount duty and honor our commitment to our kids.</p>

<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Beginning January 1, 2026, for taxes due in 2027, an intangible assets tax is imposed on each Washington resident. The tax equals $0.34 per $1,000 of the true and fair value of a resident's taxable worldwide intangible assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the tax imposed under this section applies to the true and fair value of a resident's taxable worldwide intangible assets as of December 31st of the tax year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of any individual who dies during a tax year and who is not married or in a state registered domestic partnership on the date of such individual's death:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The tax imposed under this section applies to the true and fair value of the individual's taxable worldwide intangible assets as of the date of the individual's death; and</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>

</li>
<li>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If an individual is treated as the owner of any portion of a trust that qualifies as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes, that individual must be treated as the owner of that property for purposes of the tax imposed in this section to the extent such property includes intangible assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A grantor of a trust that does not qualify as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes must nevertheless be treated as the owner of the intangible assets of the trust for purposes of the tax imposed in this section if the grantor's transfer of assets to the trust is treated as an incomplete gift under Title 26 U.S.C. Sec. 2511 of the internal revenue code and its accompanying regulations.</p>

<li>
<p>Intangible assets transferred after the effective date of this section by a resident to an individual who is a member of the family of the resident and has not attained the age of 18 must be treated as property of the resident for any calendar year before the year in which such individual attains the age of 18.

The petition must be made on a form and in a format prescribed by the department.</p>

<li>
<p>Any relief granted under this section may not result in an increase in the exemption amount under section 6(1) of this act.

<h2 id="section-14">Section 14 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-14">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is the legislature's intent to require all taxpayers to pay their fair share of taxes. To accomplish this purpose, it is the legislature's intent to stop transactions or arrangements that are designed to unfairly avoid taxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must disregard, for tax purposes, the tax avoidance transactions or arrangements that are described in subsection (3) of this section. The department must deny the tax benefit that would otherwise result from the tax avoidance transaction or arrangement. In determining whether the department must disregard a transaction or arrangement described under subsection (3) of this section, the department may consider:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Whether an arrangement or transaction changes in a meaningful way, apart from its tax effects, the economic positions of the participants in the arrangement when considered as a whole;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether substantial nontax reasons exist for entering into an arrangement or transaction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether an arrangement or transaction is a reasonable means of accomplishing a substantial nontax purpose;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An entities' relative contributions to the work that generates income;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The location where work is performed; and</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Arrangements through which a taxpayer attempts to avoid tax under chapter 82.04 RCW by disguising income received, or otherwise avoiding tax on income, from a person that is not affiliated with the taxpayer from business activities that would be taxable in Washington by moving that income to another entity that would not be taxable in Washington;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arrangements through which a taxpayer attempts to avoid tax under chapter 82.08 or 82.12 RCW by engaging in a transaction to disguise its purchase or use of tangible personal property by vesting legal title or other ownership interest in another entity over which the taxpayer exercises control in such a manner as to effectively retain control of the tangible personal property; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arrangements through which a taxpayer attempts to avoid tax under chapter 84A.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 17 of this act) through intentional deception, such as by concealing assets or evidence of the location of the taxpayer's domicile in this state, by transferring assets prior to December 31st when the taxpayer effectively retained control of the assets, or by effectively converting taxable assets into nontaxable assets prior to December 31st when the taxpayer engages in a substantially offsetting transaction. This subsection (3)(d) does not apply to substantial intangible assets tax valuation understatements subject to the penalty in section 10 of this act.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining whether a transaction or arrangement comes within the scope of subsection (3) of this section, the department is not required to prove a taxpayer's subjective intent in engaging in the transaction or arrangement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must adopt rules to assist in determining whether a transaction or arrangement is within the scope of subsection (3) of this section. The adoption of a rule as required under this subsection is not a condition precedent for the department's exercise of the authority provided in this section. Any rules adopted under this section must include examples of transactions that the department will disregard for tax purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not affect the department's authority to apply any other remedies available under statutory or common law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section, &quot;affiliated&quot; means under common control. &quot;Control&quot; means the possession, directly or indirectly, of more than 50 percent of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting shares, by contract, or otherwise.</p>
