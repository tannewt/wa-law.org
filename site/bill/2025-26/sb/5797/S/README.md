# SB 5797 - Intangible assets tax

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5797-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that it is the state's paramount duty to amply provide every child in the state with an education, including children who qualify for special education services, creating the opportunity for each child to succeed in school and achieve success in life. The legislature further recognizes that not only our Constitution, but our conscience, call on us to ensure that all Washington children are prepared for a successful future through access to a high quality public education. Historical education reform efforts have been ongoing since 2009 with an emphasis on creating a fully funded system that is student-focused, supports all students, and fosters diversity, equity, and a welcoming classroom in every school. The legislature recognizes we are not done. The legislature acknowledges the most important priority and challenge we still face is fully funding all of our basic education obligations, including the costs associated with serving the needs of students with disabilities and the growing daily operating costs of districts. Meeting this challenge is paramount. The legislature also finds that cuts to essential services, including health care and other programs that protect the safety and well-being of the public, as well as social services protecting our most vulnerable residents, often impact programs that provide holistic services for children and their families and ultimately undermine our students' ability to arrive at the classroom ready to learn. It is the legislature's intent to meet our constitutional obligation and follow through on the promises we have made to Washington's 1,100,000 school children by raising new progressive revenue for our public schools, ensuring our students have the resources and tools necessary for success.

2. Thus, the legislature intends to diversify our state's revenue sources to include taxing certain financial intangible assets that have historically been fully exempted from the tax code; assets that are often the key drivers of wealth inequality in our state. The legislature intends to levy a wealth tax of $0.34 on every $1,000 of the true and fair value of certain financial intangible assets, such as stocks and bonds, while exempting retirement savings, college savings, and ownership interests in private companies and partnerships. Additionally, to continue to make progress toward the state having a fair and balanced tax system that works for all residents, the legislature intends to exempt up to $50,000,000 in true and fair value of taxable financial intangible assets. Revenues generated from this tax will be dedicated to the education legacy trust account for the support of public schools, early learning, child care, and higher education.

3. Furthermore, the legislature finds that more progress is needed for the state to have a fair and balanced tax system that can provide sustainable, ample funding for public schools and other essential public programs and services. Washington's tax system remains the second most regressive in the nation as it asks those with the least to pay the most as a percentage of their income. Low-income Washingtonians pay at least three times more in state and local taxes as a percentage of their income than the state's highest-income households. By exempting up to $50,000,000 in true and fair value of taxable financial intangible assets, this tax is estimated to impact just 4,300 Washingtonians, taking a significant step toward reducing the disproportionate reliance on low and middle-income households to fund public schools as we strive to meet our state's paramount duty and honor our commitment to our kids.

    b. [Empty]

        i. Except as provided in (b)(ii) of this subsection (1), returns and all supporting documents must be filed electronically using the department's online tax filing service or other method of electronic reporting as the department may authorize.

    b. [Empty]

        i. A spouse or state registered domestic partner may petition the department, on a form and in a format as required by the department, for permission to file a separate return.

        ii. For purposes of this subsection (2)(b), "good cause" means:

(A) The petitioner reasonably believes that the nonpetitioning spouse or state registered domestic partner will not cooperate in the filing of a complete and accurate joint return; or

3. Each resident required to file a return under this section must, without assessment, notice, or demand, pay any tax due under this chapter to the department on or before the due date of the return, regardless of any filing extension granted by the department. The tax must be paid by electronic funds transfer as defined in RCW 82.32.085 or by other forms of electronic payment as may be authorized by the department. The department may waive the electronic payment requirement for good cause as provided in RCW 82.32.080.

The total penalty assessed under this subsection may not exceed 25 percent of the tax due for the tax year covered by the delinquent return. The penalty under this subsection is in addition to any penalties assessed for the late payment of any tax due on the return.

    b. The department must waive the penalty imposed under this subsection if:

        i. The department is persuaded that the person's failure to file the return by the due date was due to circumstances beyond the person's control; or

        ii. The person has not been delinquent in filing any return due under this section during the preceding five calendar years.

## Section 5
1. Except as otherwise provided by law and to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, chapter 82.32 RCW applies to the administration of taxes imposed under this chapter.

## Section 6
Exemptions from the tax imposed under section 3 of this act are provided for:

1. Up to $50,000,000 of a taxpayer's financial intangible assets not exempt under subsections (2) through (13) of this section. A taxpayer may only exempt an asset, under this subsection (1), in its entirety from the tax imposed under this chapter. The department must disallow the exemption under this subsection (1) of any asset if such exemption would result in a taxpayer exempting any combination of more than $50,000,000 of assets from the tax imposed under this chapter for the tax year. A Washington resident claiming an exemption under this subsection (1) must identify each asset, along with the asset's true and fair value as of December 31st of the tax year, for which they are claiming the exemption in a form and manner prescribed by the department. For purposes of this exemption, both spouses or state registered domestic partners are considered to be one taxpayer. If the department authorizes the filing of separate returns for a tax year, each spouse or state registered domestic partner may exempt up to $25,000,000 of their financial intangible assets under this subsection (1) for that tax year;

2. Cash and cash equivalents;

3. Any of the following financial investments:

    a. Annuities;

    b. Publicly traded options;

    c. Futures contracts;

    d. Commodities contracts;

    g. Other similar investments except publicly traded stocks, publicly traded bonds, mutual funds, or exchange traded funds;

4. Units of ownership in a subchapter K entity;

5. Units of ownership and stock in a subchapter S entity;

6. Any financial intangible assets held under a retirement savings account under Title 26 U.S.C. Sec. 401(k) of the internal revenue code, a tax-sheltered annuity or custodial account described in Title 26 U.S.C. Sec. 403(b) of the internal revenue code, a deferred compensation plan under Title 26 U.S.C. Sec. 457(b) of the internal revenue code, an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity described in Title 26 U.S.C. Sec. 408 of the internal revenue code, a Roth individual retirement account described in Title 26 U.S.C. Sec. 408A of the internal revenue code, an employee defined contribution program, an employee defined benefit plan, or a similar retirement savings vehicle, whether foreign or domestic, that penalizes withdrawals until the legal or beneficial owner reaches a certain age;

7. Nonfinancial intangible assets;

8. Worldwide intangible assets of artificial persons. However, the exemption provided in this subsection (8) does not affect the computation of the true and fair value of a natural person's worldwide intangible assets;

9. Any obligations or evidences of debt of the United States and obligations of United States government agencies and corporations established by acts of the congress of the United States to the extent required by federal law to be exempt from taxation by the states;

10. Any obligations or evidences of debt of the state of Washington and its agencies, instrumentalities, political subdivisions, and municipal corporations, which include municipal bonds;

11. Any stock of the federal reserve bank, the government national mortgage association, the federal national mortgage association, and other corporations and associations established by acts of the congress of the United States;

12. Any property subject to ad valorem taxation under RCW 84.36.005; and

13. Any financial intangible assets held under a tuition savings account or prepaid tuition plan, as defined under Title 26 U.S.C. Sec. 529 of the internal revenue code, a Coverdell education savings account, also known as an education individual retirement account, under Title 26 U.S.C. Sec. 530 of the internal revenue code, or a similar vehicle providing federal tax savings to pay a legal or beneficial owner's qualified education expenses.

## Section 7
1. Financial intangible assets subject to a similar tax legally imposed on the property and paid by the taxpayer to another state for the same tax year are exempt from taxation.

2. The exemption under this section is not available if the taxpayer was domiciled in Washington state for a greater amount of time than in the other state during the tax year.

3. For purposes of this section, a similar tax does not include an estate tax, inheritance tax, gift tax, net income tax, business activity tax including a gross earnings tax or gross receipts tax, activity tax, or other tax similar to the aforementioned taxes. A tax on the value of intangible property may be considered to be a similar intangible assets tax even though taxpayers are allowed a deduction for their liabilities in computing the tax.

4. For purposes of this section, "state" has the same meaning as in RCW 82.04.462.

## Section 8
1. An individual who is required to jointly file a return under this chapter may petition the department for relief from joint and several liability for an assessment of taxes due under this chapter, including penalties and interest. Relief under this section is available only to the extent that the individual establishes by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that he or she is entitled to relief under this section. The petition must be made on a form and in a format prescribed by the department.

2. An individual is entitled to relief from joint and several liability under this section only if he or she establishes that all of the following criteria have been met:

    a. The individual jointly filed a return under this chapter for a taxable year;

    b. There is an understatement of tax due on the jointly filed return that is attributable to erroneous reporting of assets by the nonpetitioning current or former spouse or state registered domestic partner;

    c. The individual seeking relief establishes that he or she did not know, and had no reason to know, that there was such an understatement; and

    d. Taking into account all the facts and circumstances, it is manifestly inequitable to hold the individual seeking relief liable for the deficiency in tax for such taxable year attributable to such understatement.

3. Any determination under this section must be made without regard to community property laws.

4. If an individual seeking relief under this section establishes that he or she did not know, and had no reason to know, the extent of such understatement, then such individual must be relieved of liability for tax not properly paid, including penalties and interest, for such taxable year to the extent that such liability is attributable to the portion of such understatement of which such individual did not know and had no reason to know.

5. An individual seeking relief under this section has the burden of proof with respect to establishing the portion of any deficiency allocable to such individual and the portion solely allocable to the individual's current or former spouse or state registered domestic partner.

6. [Empty]

    a. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an individual seeking relief under this section may not seek relief for taxes on intangible assets derived from disqualified assets. For the purposes of this subsection, "disqualified asset" means any asset or right to an asset transferred between spouses or state registered domestic partners required to jointly file a return under this chapter if the principal purpose of the transfer was the avoidance of tax.

    b. Except as provided in (c) of this subsection (6), any transfer of assets between two spouses or state registered domestic partners, required to jointly file a return under this chapter, that is made within 12 months prior to December 31st of the tax year for which an individual is seeking relief under this section is presumed to be made with the principle purpose of avoidance of tax.

    c. The presumption under (b) of this subsection (6) does not apply to any transfer pursuant to a decree of divorce, dissolution of a domestic partnership, separate maintenance action, or a written instrument incident to such action, or to any transfer that an individual establishes did not have tax avoidance as its principal purpose.

7. If relief is granted under this section, any asset giving rise to a deficiency on a jointly filed return shall be allocated to the individuals filing the return in the same manner as it would have been allocated if the individuals had filed separate returns for the taxable year. No relief granted under this section may reduce the combined tax liability of individuals required to jointly file a return under this chapter in any given tax year.

8. Any relief granted under this section may not result in an increase in the exemption amount under section 6(1) of this act. Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit individuals required to jointly file a return under this chapter to claim a combined exemption under section 6(1) of this act exceeding the limit established in section 6(1) of this act.

9. An individual seeking relief under this section must file a petition with the department no later than two years after the date of the department's notification of the deficiency that is the subject of the petition.

10. The department may by rule provide a method or methods for allocating assets between individuals required to jointly file returns under this chapter in cases where one of the individuals is granted relief under this section. The department may also by rule provide substantiation requirements for an individual to establish his or her eligibility for relief under this section.

11. An individual seeking relief under this section may petition the department for a review of a denial of such relief pursuant to RCW 82.32.160.

## Section 9
1. Any person having been issued a notice of additional taxes, delinquent taxes, interest, or penalties assessed by the department, may within 30 days after the issuance of the original notice of the amount thereof or within the period covered by any extension of the due date thereof granted by the department petition the department in writing for a correction of the amount of the assessment, and a conference for examination and review of the assessment. The petition shall set forth the reasons why the correction should be granted and the amount of the tax, interest, or penalties, which the petitioner believes to be due. The department shall promptly consider the petition and may grant or deny it. If denied, the petitioner shall be notified by mail, or electronically as provided in RCW 82.32.135, thereof forthwith. If a conference is granted, the department shall fix the time and place therefor and notify the petitioner thereof by mail or electronically as provided in RCW 82.32.135. After the conference the department may make such determination as may appear to it to be just and lawful and shall mail a copy of its determination to the petitioner, or provide a copy of its determination electronically as provided in RCW 82.32.135. If no such petition is filed within the 30-day period the assessment covered by the notice shall become final.

2. The procedures provided for herein shall apply also to a notice denying, in whole or in part, an application for a pollution control tax exemption and credit certificate, with such modifications to such procedures established by departmental rules and regulations as may be necessary to accommodate a claim for exemption or credit.

3. The procedures provided in subsection (1) of this section, as modified in this subsection (3), also apply to a notice denying, in whole or in part, a petition for relief from joint and several liability under section 8 of this act. A petition under this subsection (3) is due within 30 days after the date the department issued its denial of relief under section 8 of this act. The petition must set forth the reasons why the department should grant the petitioner's request for relief from joint and several liability. The petition must also set forth the portion of any deficiency allocable to the petitioner and the portion solely allocable to the petitioner's current or former spouse or state registered domestic partner.

## Section 10
1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, if any portion of an underpayment of tax due under this chapter is due to a substantial intangible assets tax valuation understatement, there must be added to the tax an amount equal to:

    a. In the case of any substantial intangible assets tax valuation understatement that is a gross intangible assets tax valuation misstatement, 50 percent of the portion of the underpayment due to the valuation understatement; or

    b. In all other cases, 30 percent of the portion of the underpayment due to the valuation understatement.

2. The penalty imposed under subsection (1) of this section does not apply unless the portion of the underpayment attributable to substantial intangible assets tax valuation understatements for the calendar year exceeds $5,000.

3. The penalty imposed in this section is in addition to any other applicable penalties imposed under this chapter or chapter 82.32 RCW on the same tax due, except for the penalty imposed in RCW 82.32.090(7).

4. For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:

    a. "Gross intangible assets tax valuation misstatement" means the true and fair value of any intangible assets reported on a return required by this chapter is 40 percent or less of the amount determined to be the correct amount of such true and fair value.

    b. "Substantial intangible assets tax valuation understatement" means the true and fair value of any intangible assets reported on a return required by this chapter is 65 percent or less of the amount determined to be the correct amount of such true and fair value.

## Section 11
The legislature intends that any provision of this chapter that is found to be ambiguous by a court of competent jurisdiction or administrative agency be construed in favor of application of the tax, notwithstanding any contrary common law rule of statutory construction.

## Section 12
Title 84 RCW does not apply to this chapter.

## Section 13
1. For the purposes of this chapter, "raises taxes" means any action or combination of actions by the state legislature that increases state tax revenue deposited in any fund, budget, or account, regardless of whether the revenues are deposited into the general fund.

2. Political subdivisions of the state may not impose any tax on intangible property listed in RCW 84.36.070 as that statute exists on January 1, 1993.

## Section 14
1. It is the legislature's intent to require all taxpayers to pay their fair share of taxes. To accomplish this purpose, it is the legislature's intent to stop transactions or arrangements that are designed to unfairly avoid taxes.

2. The department must disregard, for tax purposes, the tax avoidance transactions or arrangements that are described in subsection (3) of this section. The department must deny the tax benefit that would otherwise result from the tax avoidance transaction or arrangement. In determining whether the department must disregard a transaction or arrangement described under subsection (3) of this section, the department may consider:

    a. Whether an arrangement or transaction changes in a meaningful way, apart from its tax effects, the economic positions of the participants in the arrangement when considered as a whole;

    b. Whether substantial nontax reasons exist for entering into an arrangement or transaction;

    c. Whether an arrangement or transaction is a reasonable means of accomplishing a substantial nontax purpose;

    d. An entities' relative contributions to the work that generates income;

    e. The location where work is performed; and

    f. Other relevant factors.

3. This section applies only to the following transactions or arrangements:

    a. Arrangements that are, in form, a joint venture or similar arrangement between a construction contractor and the owner or developer of a construction project but that are, in substance, substantially guaranteed payments for the purchase of construction services characterized by a failure of the parties' agreement to provide for the contractor to share substantial profits and bear significant risk of loss in the venture;

    b. Arrangements through which a taxpayer attempts to avoid tax under chapter 82.04 RCW by disguising income received, or otherwise avoiding tax on income, from a person that is not affiliated with the taxpayer from business activities that would be taxable in Washington by moving that income to another entity that would not be taxable in Washington;

    c. Arrangements through which a taxpayer attempts to avoid tax under chapter 82.08 or 82.12 RCW by engaging in a transaction to disguise its purchase or use of tangible personal property by vesting legal title or other ownership interest in another entity over which the taxpayer exercises control in such a manner as to effectively retain control of the tangible personal property; and

    d. Arrangements through which a taxpayer attempts to avoid tax under chapter 84A.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 17 of this act) through intentional deception, such as by concealing assets or evidence of the location of the taxpayer's domicile in this state, by transferring assets prior to December 31st when the taxpayer effectively retained control of the assets, or by effectively converting taxable assets into nontaxable assets prior to December 31st when the taxpayer engages in a substantially offsetting transaction. This subsection (3)(d) does not apply to substantial intangible assets tax valuation understatements subject to the penalty in section 10 of this act.

4. In determining whether a transaction or arrangement comes within the scope of subsection (3) of this section, the department is not required to prove a taxpayer's subjective intent in engaging in the transaction or arrangement.

5. The department must adopt rules to assist in determining whether a transaction or arrangement is within the scope of subsection (3) of this section. The adoption of a rule as required under this subsection is not a condition precedent for the department's exercise of the authority provided in this section. Any rules adopted under this section must include examples of transactions that the department will disregard for tax purposes.

6. This section does not affect the department's authority to apply any other remedies available under statutory or common law.

7. For purposes of this section, "affiliated" means under common control. "Control" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of more than 50 percent of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting shares, by contract, or otherwise.
