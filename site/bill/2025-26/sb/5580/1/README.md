# SB 5580 - Corp. homeowner registration

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5580.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that the acquisition of single-family homes and condominiums by private equity firms, real estate investment trusts, and other corporate entities is rapidly increasing in Washington, accounting for 22 percent of single-family home purchases in Washington in 2022, a 102 percent increase from 2020. The legislature further finds that corporate buyers often target lower-priced starter homes, typically located in neighborhoods with higher concentrations of families of color, working individuals, and single parent families. Leveraging significant financial advantages, such as purchasing homes with cash, these entities outcompete individual buyers and remove homes from the market, reducing opportunities for homeownership and increasing the risk of neighborhood displacement and gentrification. Once acquired, these properties are often converted into rental units or sold in bulk to other entities, permanently reducing the supply of affordable housing available for individual ownership.

This trend is making a profound impact on Washington's housing market with rapidly rising housing costs, diminishing affordability, and increasing challenges for first-time and lower-income buyers disproportionately impacting working-class families and communities of color.

The legislature finds that transparency is essential to understanding the dynamics of Washington's housing market and responding effectively to its challenges. While progress has been made through local rental registries, there remains a critical gap in tracking and analyzing the scale, nature, and impact of corporate and institutional ownership, particularly in the single-family housing sector. Currently, no centralized system exists to monitor these ownership patterns statewide.

To address this gap, the legislature intends to establish a corporate homeowner registration program within the office of the secretary of state. This program will require corporate entities to report ownership structures, property uses, and other basic information, ensuring accurate and timely data collection. This data will provide policymakers, local governments, and the public with the tools needed to make informed, evidence-based decisions to preserve housing affordability, equity, and accessibility across the state.

This act constitutes an exercise of the state's responsibility to protect and promote the health, safety, and welfare of Washington's residents. As such, it is intended to foster fairness and transparency in the housing market, mitigate the negative impacts of monopolistic ownership, and support measures to close the racial wealth gap and housing affordability crisis.

## Section 2
The corporate homeowner registration program is established at the office of the secretary of state.
