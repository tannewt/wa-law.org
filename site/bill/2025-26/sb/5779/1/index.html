<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature intends to fully recognize and celebrate the rich legacy of the people of African descent, their independence days, holidays, cultural food, festivals, and to raise awareness of their diverse community needs. Further, the legislature intends to provide cultural recognition and celebration to acknowledge and honor the history and cultural heritage of all the people of African descent, whose communities continuously demonstrate this legacy through traditional weddings, ethnic associations, religious institutions, traditional customs, rites of passage, and sporting events. Attendance at these events is not only an educational experience for all Washingtonians, but also serves as a unifying and therapeutic connection for the entire diaspora, facilitating opportunities for the elderly to interact with community youth to keep their minds active and to stay socially engaged.</p>
<p>Therefore, the last full calendar week in July of each year shall be known as African diaspora heritage week. This is designated as a time for people of this state to commemorate the contributions of Americans of African descent to the history and heritage of Washington state and the United States.</p>
