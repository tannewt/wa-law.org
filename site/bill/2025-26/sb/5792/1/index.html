Any additional contributions to the retirement system required because compensation earnable under (b)(ii)(A) of this subsection is greater than compensation earnable under (b)(ii)(B) of this subsection shall be paid by the member for both member and employer contributions.</p>
<pre><code>c. In calculating earnable compensation under (a) or (b) of this subsection, the department of retirement systems shall include:

    i.
