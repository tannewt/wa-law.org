<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes the essential role small businesses play in fostering community connections and supporting local economies. In Washington, small businesses make up 99.5 percent of all businesses and employ over 1,400,000 individuals, representing 49 percent of the state's workforce. Businesses that serve families, such as early learning, child care and education programs, and those that create community spaces, like neighborhood cafés, are critical to building strong social ties and vibrant, walkable neighborhoods that enhance residents' quality of life. Allowing certain small businesses to operate in residential zones can strengthen community bonds, support families, reduce emissions, and promote local employment and entrepreneurship. This legislation encourages cities and towns to facilitate the establishment of compatible small businesses within residential areas, contributing to vibrant, resilient neighborhoods while preserving their character and livability.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
