<li>
<p>The seizure is incident to an arrest or a search under a search warrant or an inspection under an administrative inspection warrant;</p>

<li>
<p>In the event of seizure pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, proceedings for forfeiture shall be deemed commenced by the seizure. The law enforcement agency under whose authority the seizure was made shall cause notice to be served within fifteen days following the seizure on the owner of the property seized and the person in charge thereof and any person having any known right or interest therein, including any community property interest, of the seizure and intended forfeiture of the seized property. Service of notice of seizure of real property shall be made according to the rules of civil procedure. However, the state may not obtain a default judgment with respect to real property against a party who is served by substituted service absent an affidavit stating that a good faith effort has been made to ascertain if the defaulted party is incarcerated within the state, and that there is no present basis to believe that the party is incarcerated within the state. Notice of seizure in the case of property subject to a security interest that has been perfected by filing a financing statement in accordance with chapter 62A.9A RCW, or a certificate of title, shall be made by service upon the secured party or the secured party's assignee at the address shown on the financing statement or the certificate of title. The notice of seizure in other cases may be served by any method authorized by law or court rule including but not limited to service by certified mail with return receipt requested. Service by mail shall be deemed complete upon mailing within the 15-day period following the seizure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If no person notifies the seizing law enforcement agency in writing of the person's claim of ownership or right to possession of items specified in subsection (1)(d), (g), or (h) of this section within 60 days of the service of notice from the seizing agency in the case of personal property and 120 days in the case of real property, the item seized shall be deemed forfeited. The community property interest in real property of a person whose spouse or domestic partner committed a violation giving rise to seizure of the real property may not be forfeited if the person did not participate in the violation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any person notifies the seizing law enforcement agency in writing of the person's claim of ownership or right to possession of items specified in subsection (1)(b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), or (h) of this section within 60 days of the service of notice from the seizing agency in the case of personal property and 120 days in the case of real property, the person or persons shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard as to the claim or right. The notice of claim may be served by any method authorized by law or court rule including, but not limited to, service by first-class mail. Service by mail shall be deemed complete upon mailing within the 60-day period following service of the notice of seizure in the case of personal property and within the 120-day period following service of the notice of seizure in the case of real property. The hearing shall be before the chief law enforcement officer of the seizing agency or the chief law enforcement officer's designee, except where the seizing agency is a state agency as defined in RCW 34.12.020(4), the hearing shall be before the chief law enforcement officer of the seizing agency or an administrative law judge appointed under chapter 34.12 RCW, except that any person asserting a claim or right may remove the matter to a court of competent jurisdiction. Removal of any matter involving personal property may only be accomplished according to the rules of civil procedure. The person seeking removal of the matter must serve process against the state, county, political subdivision, or municipality that operates the seizing agency, and any other party of interest, in accordance with RCW 4.28.080 or 4.92.020, within 45 days after the person seeking removal has notified the seizing law enforcement agency of the person's claim of ownership or right to possession. The court to which the matter is to be removed shall be the district court, or the municipal court for the jurisdiction in which the property was seized, when the aggregate value of personal property is within the jurisdictional limit set forth in RCW 3.66.020. A hearing before the seizing agency and any appeal therefrom shall be under Title 34 RCW. In all cases, the burden of proof is upon the law enforcement agency to establish, by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence, that the property is subject to forfeiture.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The seizing law enforcement agency shall promptly return the article or articles to the claimant, in a substantially similar condition as when seized, upon a determination by the administrative law judge or court that the claimant is the present lawful owner or is lawfully entitled to possession thereof of items specified in subsection (1)(b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), or (h) of this section.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<p>In any proceeding to forfeit property under this title, where the claimant substantially prevails, the claimant is entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the claimant. In addition, in a court hearing between two or more claimants to the article or articles involved, the prevailing party is entitled to a judgment for costs and reasonable attorneys' fees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When property is forfeited under this chapter the commission or seizing law enforcement agency may:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Retain it for official use or upon application by any law enforcement agency of this state release such property to such agency for the exclusive use of enforcing the provisions of this chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sell that which is not required to be destroyed by law and which is not harmful to the public;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request the appropriate sheriff or director of public safety to take custody of the property and remove it for disposition in accordance with law; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forward it to the drug enforcement administration for disposition.</p>

<p>By January 31st of each year, each seizing agency shall remit to the state an amount equal to 10 percent of the net proceeds of any property forfeited during the preceding calendar year for deposit into the behavioral health loan repayment and scholarship program account created in RCW 28B.115.135 through June 30, 2027, and into the state general fund thereafter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The net proceeds of forfeited property is the value of the forfeitable interest in the property after deducting the cost of satisfying any bona fide security interest to which the property is subject at the time of seizure; and in the case of sold property, after deducting the cost of sale, including reasonable fees or commissions paid to independent selling agents, and the cost of any valid landlord's claim for damages under subsection (14) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The value of sold forfeited property is the sale price. The value of retained forfeited property is the fair market value of the property at the time of seizure, determined when possible by reference to an applicable commonly used index, such as the index used by the department of licensing for valuation of motor vehicles. A seizing agency may use, but need not use, an independent qualified appraiser to determine the value of retained property. If an appraiser is used, the value of the property appraised is net of the cost of the appraisal. The value of destroyed property and retained firearms or illegal property is zero.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forfeited property and net proceeds not required to be remitted to the state shall be retained by the seizing law enforcement agency exclusively for the expansion and improvement of controlled substances related law enforcement activity. If the seizing agency is a port district operating an airport in a county with a population of more than one million, it may use the net proceeds not required to be remitted to the state for purposes related to controlled substances law enforcement, substance abuse education, human trafficking interdiction, and responsible gun ownership. Money retained under this section may not be used to supplant preexisting funding sources.</p>
