## Section 15
1. [Empty]

    a. Any nonresident or foreign manufacturer that has not registered to do business in the state as a foreign corporation or business entity must, as a condition precedent to having its vapor products containing nicotine included or retained in the directory, appoint and continually engage without interruption the services of an agent in this state to act as agent for the service of process on whom all process, and any action or proceeding against it concerning or arising out of the enforcement of sections 7 through 17 of this act, may be served in any manner authorized by law. The service must constitute legal and valid service of process on the manufacturer. The manufacturer must provide the name, address, phone number, and proof of the appointment and availability of the agent to the satisfaction of the board.

    b. The manufacturer must provide notice to the board 30 days prior to termination of the authority of an agent and must further provide proof to the satisfaction of the board of the appointment of a new agent no fewer than five days prior to the termination of an existing agent appointment. In the event an agent terminates an agency appointment, the manufacturer must notify the board of the termination within five days and include proof to the satisfaction of the board of the appointment of a new agent.

    c. Any manufacturer whose vapor products containing nicotine are sold in this state, who has not appointed and engaged an agent as required in this section, must be deemed to have appointed the secretary of state as the agent and may be proceeded against in courts of this state by service of process upon the secretary of state. However, the appointment of the secretary of state as agent must not satisfy the condition precedent for having the vapor products containing nicotine of the manufacturer included or retained in the directory.

## Section 16
1. Any nonresident or foreign manufacturer that has not registered to do business in the state as a foreign corporation or business entity shall, as a condition precedent to having its name or its vapor products containing nicotine listed and retained in the directory, submit to the board a surety bond or other cash security payable to the state of Washington in the amount of $25,000. The bond must be posted by a corporate surety located within the United States.

2. The bond must be conditioned on the performance by the manufacturer of all requirements and obligations imposed by this section. A surety on a manufacturer's bond is liable up to the amount of the bond, and the state may execute on such surety bond, for the payment of fines and penalties imposed on the manufacturer under section 13 of this act and for the costs of seizure and destruction of products sold in violation of sections 7 through 17 of this act. If the state executes on the surety bond, it may require the manufacturer to provide an additional bond as a condition precedent for retaining the manufacturer or its vapor products containing nicotine in the directory.

3. A surety on a bond furnished by a manufacturer as provided in this section must be released and discharged from liability to the state accruing on the bond after expiration of 60 days from the date upon which such surety lodges with the board a written request to be released and discharged. This provision does not relieve, release, or discharge the surety from liability already accrued or which will accrue before the expiration of the 60-day period. The board shall, upon receiving any such request, notify the manufacturer who furnished the bond. Unless the manufacturer, on or before the expiration of the 60-day period, files with the board a new bond, with the surety approved by and acceptable to the board, the board shall remove the manufacturer and its vapor products containing nicotine from the directory.
