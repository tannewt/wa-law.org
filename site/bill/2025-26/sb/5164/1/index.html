<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes that Washington is ranked among the top states for the share of jobs requiring postsecondary education, and that large majorities of high school students self-report aspirations to continue their education beyond 12th grade. However, only an estimated 40 percent of Washington's high school class of 2021 is projected to obtain a postsecondary credential. This issue is particularly pressing for students from lower income households. The legislature further recognizes that the real or perceived cost of postsecondary education is a critical systemic barrier that impedes prospective students from applying for and enrolling in postsecondary education. This is despite Washington boasting one of the most expansive and equitable set of state-level postsecondary financial aid programs in the country.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that counseling, advising, and coaching that help students with the postsecondary financial aid application and enrollment processes, and that provide hands-on assistance, are evidence-based approaches to increasing rates of postsecondary enrollment. The legislature further recognizes that school counselors and other on-site experts deliver comprehensive school counseling programs, which provide support for students and their families in securing postsecondary opportunities. A primary role for school counselors is to assist students in planning for postsecondary options. The addition of enrollment and outreach specialists can provide a valuable resource for comprehensive school counseling programs and broaden access to student navigational supports throughout the state. Therefore, Washington state should invest in student navigational supports and services to advise students to and through postsecondary education and training. It is the legislature's intent to establish a postsecondary outreach and enrollment specialist program for the purposes of helping Washington high school students with postsecondary financial aid and educational opportunities as well as encouraging completion of financial aid and postsecondary enrollment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the legislature intends to ensure that every school district has access to at least one qualified financial aid professional to provide support and ensure accurate and timely administration of financial aid forms. To achieve this, the legislature intends to make available, at no cost to participants, comprehensive financial aid training for teachers, school counselors, postsecondary staff, and community partners.</p>
