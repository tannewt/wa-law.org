<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that a significant number of Washington residents are currently rent-burdened, spending a disproportionate amount of their income on housing expenses. High rents have become a substantial burden for too many Washingtonians, limiting their ability to access safe and affordable housing. This situation creates economic instability and negatively impacts the overall well-being of individuals and families across the state. This strain contributes to financial insecurity, making it challenging for individuals and families of all shapes and sizes to meet other essential needs, such as health care, education, and savings for the future. This phenomenon exacerbates existing inequalities and hinders economic mobility for a significant portion of the population.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature has taken significant steps to address the affordable housing crisis, including investing in housing development, expanding rental assistance programs, and enacting tenant protections. However, these efforts will take time to bear fruit, and many households continue to face immediate financial hardship due to high rental costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to address the issue of housing affordability by establishing a tenant assistance program. This program aims to reduce the number of people who are rent-burdened by providing financial assistance to eligible individuals and families. This program seeks to create a more equitable and accessible housing market, fostering stability and opportunity for Washington residents. By implementing this program, the legislature aims to alleviate the economic strain caused by high rents, promote housing security, and enhance the overall quality of life for residents of the state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
