<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>Access to the collective and individual protections afforded by established federal and state labor laws, as well as ensuring stable, effective, and efficient labor-management relations, is a vital state interest that has critical benefit to the state's economic and social development. It is declared to be the policy of the state to guarantee agricultural employees the full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, to negotiate the terms and conditions of their employment, and that they shall be free from interference, restraint, or coercion of agricultural employers of labor, or their agents, in the designation of such representatives or in self-organization or in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protections. Therefore, this act extends collective bargaining rights to agricultural employees.</p>
<p>The agricultural context often poses significant barriers for employees attempting to undertake concerted activity, such as seasonal and short-term employment and high numbers of employees who are limited English proficient and have had limited opportunity for educational attainment. It is the policy of the state to administer agricultural collective bargaining rights in a manner that takes these barriers into account, including by having procedures that are expeditious and linguistically and culturally appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="section-7">Section 7 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7">¶</a></h2>
<p>The commission, after hearing upon reasonable notice, shall decide in each application for certification as an exclusive bargaining representative or unit clarification, the unit appropriate for the purpose of collective bargaining. In determining, modifying, or combining the bargaining unit, the commission shall consider: The duties, skills, and working conditions of the agricultural employees; the history of collective bargaining by the agricultural employees and their bargaining representatives; the extent of organization among the agricultural employees; and the desire of the agricultural employees, and the avoidance of excessive fragmentation.</p>
<h2 id="section-8">Section 8 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-8">¶</a></h2>
<p>The commission must determine the bargaining representative by:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Conducting a cross-check pursuant to section 9 of this act; or</p>
</li>

</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-9">Section 9 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If a farmworker labor organization seeking to represent agricultural employees has filed LM forms for the preceding two years with the federal department of labor and is the only farmworker labor organization seeking certification as exclusive bargaining representative of a bargaining unit for which there is no incumbent exclusive bargaining representative, the commission may determine the question concerning representation by conducting a cross-check comparing the bargaining authorization cards against the employment records of the agricultural employer. A determination through a cross-check process may be made upon a showing of interest submitted in support of the exclusive bargaining representative by more than 50 percent of the agricultural employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The farmworker labor organization that has been determined through cross-check to represent a majority of the agricultural employees in the bargaining unit shall be certified by the commission as the exclusive bargaining representative of, and shall be required to represent, all the agricultural employees within the unit without regard to membership in said bargaining representative.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-10">Section 10 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-10">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If a farmworker labor organization seeking to represent agricultural employees has not filed LM forms with the federal department of labor for the preceding two years, or is not the only farmworker labor organization seeking certification as the exclusive bargaining representative, the commission shall conduct an election to ascertain the exclusive bargaining representative and upon the request of a farmworker labor organization showing written proof of at least 30 percent representation of the agricultural employees within the unit. The commission shall, within 10 calendar days from the showing, hold an election by secret ballot to determine the issue. The ballot shall contain the name of such farmworker labor organization and of any other farmworker labor organization showing written proof of at least 10 percent representation of the agricultural employees within the unit, together with a choice for any agricultural employee to designate that they do not desire to be represented by any bargaining representative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where more than one organization is on the ballot and neither of the three or more choices receives a majority vote of the agricultural employees within the bargaining unit, a runoff election shall be held. The runoff ballot shall contain the two choices which received the largest and second-largest number of votes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The farmworker labor organization that has been determined through election to represent a majority of the voting agricultural employees shall be certified by the commission as the exclusive bargaining representative of, and shall be required to represent, all the agricultural employees within the unit without regard to membership in said bargaining representative.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-11">Section 11 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-11">¶</a></h2>
<p>No question concerning representation may be raised within one year of a certification or attempted certification. Where there is a valid collective bargaining agreement in effect, no question of representation may be raised except during the period not more than 90 nor less than 60 days prior to the expiration date of the agreement. Any agreement which contains a provision for automatic renewal or extension of the agreement is not effective as a bar to a question concerning representation if it extends the total term of the agreement's existence for more than three years.</p>
<h2 id="section-12">Section 12 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-12">¶</a></h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Upon the certification of an exclusive bargaining representative for the agricultural employer's employees, the agricultural employer has the duty to engage in collective bargaining with the exclusive bargaining representative before changing any wages, hours, or working conditions of the represented agricultural employees. Any allegation by the exclusive bargaining representative that the agricultural employer has made a unilateral change in wages, hours, and working conditions may be presented for resolution to an arbitrator selected mutually or by application of the exclusive bargaining representative to the commission for provision of the arbitrator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should a collective bargaining agreement between the exclusive bargaining representative and the agricultural employer expire, its provisions, except any prohibition on strikes or lockouts, continue in force until renegotiated. During the agreement's hiatus, any allegation by the exclusive bargaining representative that the agricultural employer has made a unilateral change in wages or economic benefits may be presented for resolution to an arbitrator selected mutually or by application of the exclusive bargaining representative to the commission for provision of the arbitrator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon the failure of the agricultural employer and the exclusive bargaining representative to conclude a collective bargaining agreement within three months of certification of the exclusive bargaining representative or within three months of the expiration of the last collective bargaining agreement, all matters remaining in dispute shall be submitted by the parties to the commission for resolution through interest arbitration.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-14">Section 14 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-14">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If an agreement through bargaining has not been reached within three months of certification, or within three months of the expiration of the last collective bargaining agreement, the parties may agree in writing to continue to bargain for an additional month. Thereafter they may agree in writing to continue bargaining on a month-to-month basis. If the parties have not entered into a written agreement to extend bargaining, or the final agreement to extend bargaining has expired, the parties must submit their dispute to interest arbitration. Each party shall submit that party's last and final proposals upon which there exists an impasse. All impasse items shall be submitted to arbitration under this section. The arbitrator or arbitration panel is empowered to review the parties' final proposals and to consider mediator findings, if any, and to issue a decision on the submitted items along with the previously agreed items, such that a complete agreement is imposed through the arbitration. The arbitrator or arbitration panel is also empowered to consider evidence submitted by the parties concerning factors such as the employer's ability to meet the costs of a contract, employee compensation at comparable employers, and cost of living in the relevant geographic area in their decision-making process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the parties cannot agree on the arbitrator or arbitration panel within five days of the expiration of the three-month period following certification or expiration of the previous agreement, the parties shall apply to the commission or, if both parties agree, the American arbitration association to provide a list of five qualified arbitrators from which the arbitrator or arbitration panel shall be chosen. Each party shall pay one-half of the fees and expenses of the arbitration and of the recording of the proceedings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In consultation with the parties, the arbitrator or arbitration panel shall promptly establish a date, time, and place for a hearing which shall be no later than two months following the appointment of the arbitrator or arbitration panel. The arbitrator or arbitration panel shall provide reasonable notice thereof to the parties to the dispute. The parties shall exchange final positions in writing, with copies to the arbitrator or arbitration panel, with respect to every issue to be arbitrated, on a date mutually agreed upon, but in no event later than 10 working days before the date set for the hearing. A hearing shall be held, and each party shall have the opportunity to present evidence and make arguments. The rules of evidence prevailing in judicial proceedings may be considered, but are not binding, and any oral testimony or documentary evidence or other data deemed relevant by the arbitrator or chair of the arbitration panel may be received in evidence. A recording of the proceedings shall be taken. The arbitrator or arbitration panel shall have the power to administer oaths, require the attendance of witnesses, and require the production of such books, papers, contracts, agreements, and documents as may be deemed by the arbitrator or chair of the arbitration panel to be material to a just determination of the issues in dispute. If any person refuses to obey a subpoena issued by the arbitrator or arbitration panel, or refuses to be sworn or to make an affirmation to testify, or any witness, party, or attorney for a party is guilty of any contempt while in attendance at any hearing held hereunder, the arbitrator may invoke the jurisdiction of the superior court in the county where the labor dispute exists, and the court has jurisdiction to issue an appropriate order. Any failure to obey the order may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within 30 days following the conclusion of the hearing, the arbitrator or arbitration panel shall make written findings of fact and a written determination of the issues in dispute, based on the evidence presented. A copy thereof shall be served on each of the parties to the dispute. That determination is final and binding upon both parties, subject to review by the superior court upon the application of either party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The superior court's scope of review is limited to whether:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The arbitrator or arbitration panel acted without, or in excess of, their powers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The arbitration has proceeded in the manner required by law;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The order or decision of the arbitrator or arbitration panel was procured by fraud or was an abuse of discretion;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The decision of the arbitrator or arbitration panel was arbitrary or capricious; and</p>
</li>

<p>In addition to any contractually agreed method for selecting arbitrators, the parties may mutually request the commission to, and the commission shall, appoint a qualified person who may be an employee of the commission to act as an arbitrator to assist in the resolution of a labor dispute between an agricultural employer and an exclusive bargaining representative arising from the application of the matters contained in a collective bargaining agreement.

<p>WHEREAS, Under prevailing economic conditions, developed with the aid of governmental authority for owners of property to organize in the corporate and other forms of ownership association, the individual unorganized worker is commonly helpless to exercise actual liberty of contract and to protect his or her freedom of labor, and thereby to obtain acceptable terms and conditions of employment, wherefore, though he or she should be free to decline to associate with his or her fellows, it is necessary that he or she have full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of his or her own choosing, to negotiate the terms and conditions of his or her employment, and that he or she shall be free from interference, restraint, or coercion of employers of labor, or their agents, in the designation of such representatives or in self-organization or in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protections; therefore, the following definitions of, and limitations upon, the jurisdiction and authority of the courts of the state of Washington are hereby enacted.</p>
