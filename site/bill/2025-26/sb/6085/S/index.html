<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes that providing incarcerated individuals with meaningful opportunities for personal enrichment, family visitation and contact, recreation, and related activities supports rehabilitation and prosocial behavior and contributes to institutional safety and well-being. The legislature further recognizes the importance of ensuring that expenditures from the institutional welfare account are informed by the lived experiences and real-time needs of incarcerated individuals.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the legislature intends to formalize a collaborative process among the department of corrections and the incarcerated individuals served by the institutional welfare account. To promote equitable and informed decision making, the legislature further finds that community and affinity groups comprised of currently incarcerated individuals should be consulted to the greatest extent practicable.</p>
<p>The legislature intends for the department of corrections to make reasonable efforts to establish and maintain an ongoing feedback loop among incarcerated individuals, their families, and the department regarding the availability and quality of goods, services, and programs at correctional institutions managed by the department.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
