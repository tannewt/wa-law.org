<li>
<p>The department is tasked with generating greater local capacity. To achieve this objective, the department may advance funds to public benefit nonprofit corporations, as defined in RCW 24.03A.245, that have received grants from the department. This advance funding pilot program will provide advance funds, as described in this section, to eligible grant recipients who have demonstrated the need for advance funding in order to perform the work required by the department grant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall develop uniform equity-driven procedures for the demonstration of need. The department shall consult with external partners, including impacted communities, to develop the procedures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall develop eligibility criteria for advance fund applicants. The department shall prioritize those applicants with an average annual budget less than $5,000,000. The eligibility criteria must include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The recipient must have been awarded a department grant within six months;</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advance fund payments are to be one time and limited to no more than 25 percent of the grant or $200,000, whichever is less. The amount of the advance fund payment must be deducted from the total grant awarded to the recipient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An enforceable contract that protects the interests of the state must be fully executed before any advance fund payments are made. The advance fund recipient shall use the awarded funds only for the purpose stated in the contract.</p>
