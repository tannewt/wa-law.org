<li>In addition to other eligibility requirements outlined in this chapter, students whose annual household income is at or below 65 percent of the annual state median income are eligible to receive the Washington college grant. The amount a student may receive of the Washington college grant is dependent on the household's annual income, adjusted for household size, and the difference in the household's annual share of higher education costs provided in this section and the maximum Washington college grant. Beginning with academic year 2026-27, the office must calculate a household's annual share of higher education costs as follows:</li>
</ol>
<p>If the household's annual income, adjusted for household size, is:</p>
<p>Then the household's annual share of higher education costs, based on a household of two, are:</p>
<p>Below 25 percent of the state median income</p>
<p>$0</p>
<p>At or above 25 percent and below 35 percent of the state median income</p>
<p>25 percent of the state median income for a household of two, multiplied by 5 percent</p>
<p>At or above 35 percent and below 45 percent of the state median income</p>
<p>35 percent of the state median income for a household of two, multiplied by 5.5 percent</p>
<p>At or above 45 percent and below 55 percent of the state median income</p>
<p>45 percent of the state median income for a household of two, multiplied by 6 percent</p>
<p>At or above 55 percent and at or below 65 percent of the state median income</p>
<p>55 percent of the state median income for a household of two, multiplied by 6.5 percent</p>
