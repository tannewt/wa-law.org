<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The system of services for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities should provide a balanced range of health, social, and supportive services at home or in other residential settings. The receipt of services should be coordinated so as to minimize administrative cost and service duplication, and eliminate unnecessarily complex system organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Residential habilitation centers exist to provide a safe place to live and appropriate supports to learn the skills needed to live with as much self-determination and independence as possible, including moving to a community-based setting if so desired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Residential habilitation centers should promote individual dignity, autonomy, and a home-like environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state has made efforts towards shrinking the residential habilitation centers, particularly at Rainier school and Yakima Valley school, in recent years. The department of social and health services has thoughtfully and successfully transitioned many of the residents at residential habilitation centers into smaller supported settings. The legislature finds that this has been successful because of intentional efforts to honor personal choice, deliberate and transparent work with residents, families, and staff, and expanding supported living and state-operated living alternative settings. It has also been successful when the state makes these transitions over specific and sensible periods of time to allow for safe transition to individually tailored supports.</p>
