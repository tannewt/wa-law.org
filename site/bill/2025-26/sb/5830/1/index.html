<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that crimes and threats against persons because of their race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, political affiliation, gender, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, or mental, physical, or sensory disabilities are serious and increasing. The legislature also finds that crimes and threats are often directed against interracial couples and their children or couples of mixed religions, colors, ancestries, or national origins because of bias and bigotry against the race, color, religion, ancestry, or national origin of one person in the couple or family. The legislature finds that the state interest in preventing crimes and threats motivated by bigotry and bias goes beyond the state interest in preventing other felonies or misdemeanors such as criminal trespass, malicious mischief, assault, or other crimes that are not motivated by hatred, bigotry, and bias, and that prosecution of those other crimes inadequately protects citizens from crimes and threats motivated by bigotry and bias. Therefore, the legislature finds that protection of those citizens from threats of harm due to bias and bigotry is a compelling state interest.</p>
<p>The legislature also finds that in many cases, certain discrete words or symbols are used to threaten the victims. Those discrete words or symbols have historically or traditionally been used to connote hatred or threats towards members of the class of which the victim or a member of the victim's family or household is a member. In particular, the legislature finds that cross burnings historically and traditionally have been used to threaten, terrorize, intimidate, and harass African Americans and their families. Cross burnings often preceded lynchings, murders, burning of homes, and other acts of terror. Further, Nazi swastikas historically and traditionally have been used to threaten, terrorize, intimidate, and harass Jewish people and their families. Swastikas symbolize the massive destruction of the Jewish population, commonly known as the holocaust. Therefore, the legislature finds that any person who burns or attempts to burn a cross or displays a swastika on the property of the victim or burns a cross or displays a swastika as part of a series of acts directed towards a particular person, the person's family or household members, or a particular group, knows or reasonably should know that the cross burning or swastika may create a reasonable fear of harm in the mind of the person, the person's family and household members, or the group.</p>
<p>The legislature also finds that attacks on religious places of worship and threatening defacement of religious texts have increased, as have assaults and attacks on those who visibly self-identify as members of a religious minority, such as by wearing religious head covering or other visible articles of faith. The legislature finds that any person who defaces religious real property with derogatory words, symbols, or items, who places a vandalized or defaced religious item or scripture on the property of a victim, or who attacks or attempts to remove the religious garb or faith-based attire of a victim, knows or reasonably should know that such actions create a reasonable fear of harm in the mind of the victim.</p>
<p>The legislature also finds that a hate crime committed against a victim because of the victim's gender may be identified in the same manner that a hate crime committed against a victim of another protected group is identified. Affirmative indications of hatred towards gender as a class is the predominant factor to consider. Other factors to consider include the perpetrator's use of language, slurs, or symbols expressing hatred towards the victim's gender as a class; the severity of the attack including mutilation of the victim's sexual organs; a history of similar attacks against victims of the same gender by the perpetrator or a history of similar incidents in the same area; a lack of provocation; an absence of any other apparent motivation; and common sense.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that, since 2015, Washington state has experienced a sharp increase in malicious harassment offenses, and, in response, the legislature intends to rename the offense to its more commonly understood title of &quot;hate crime offense&quot; and create a multidisciplinary working group to establish recommendations for best practices for identifying and responding to hate crimes.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A person is guilty of a hate crime offense if the person maliciously and intentionally commits one of the following acts in whole or in part because of their perception of another person's race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, political affiliation, gender, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, or mental, physical, or sensory disability:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Assaults another person;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Causes physical damage to or destruction of the property of another; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Threatens a specific person or group of persons and places that person, or members of the specific group of persons, in reasonable fear of harm to person or property. The fear must be a fear that a reasonable person would have under all the circumstances. For purposes of this section, a &quot;reasonable person&quot; is a reasonable person who is a member of the victim's race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, political affiliation, gender, or sexual orientation, or who has the same gender expression or identity, or the same mental, physical, or sensory disability as the victim. Words alone do not constitute a hate crime offense unless the context or circumstances surrounding the words indicate the words are a threat. Threatening words do not constitute a hate crime offense if it is apparent to the victim that the person does not have the ability to carry out the threat.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In any prosecution for a hate crime offense, unless evidence exists which explains to the trier of fact's satisfaction that the person did not intend to threaten the victim or victims, the trier of fact may infer that the person intended to threaten a specific victim or group of victims because of the person's perception of the victim's or victims' race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, political affiliation, gender, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, or mental, physical, or sensory disability if the person commits one of the following acts:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Burns a cross on property of a victim who is or whom the actor perceives to be of African American heritage;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defaces property of a victim who is or whom the actor perceives to be of Jewish heritage by defacing the property with a Nazi emblem, symbol, or hakenkreuz;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defaces religious real property with words, symbols, or items that are derogatory to persons of the faith associated with the property;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Places a vandalized or defaced religious item or scripture on the property of a victim who is or whom the actor perceives to be of the faith with which that item or scripture is associated;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damages, destroys, or defaces religious garb or other faith-based attire belonging to the victim or attempts to or successfully removes religious garb or other faith-based attire from the victim's person without the victim's authorization; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Places a noose on the property of a victim who is or whom the actor perceives to be of a racial or ethnic minority group.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This subsection only applies to the creation of a reasonable inference for evidentiary purposes. This subsection does not restrict the state's ability to prosecute a person under subsection (1) of this section when the facts of a particular case do not fall within (a) through (f) of this subsection.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>It is not a defense that the accused was mistaken that the victim was a member of a certain race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, political affiliation, gender, or sexual orientation, had a particular gender expression or identity, or had a mental, physical, or sensory disability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evidence of expressions or associations of the accused may not be introduced as substantive evidence at trial unless the evidence specifically relates to the crime charged. Nothing in this chapter shall affect the rules of evidence governing impeachment of a witness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every person who commits another crime during the commission of a crime under this section may be punished and prosecuted for the other crime separately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Gender expression or identity&quot; means having or being perceived as having a gender identity, self-image, appearance, behavior, or expression, whether or not that gender identity, self-image, appearance, behavior, or expression is different from that traditionally associated with the sex assigned to that person at birth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Sexual orientation&quot; means heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Threat&quot; means to communicate, directly or indirectly, the intent to:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Cause bodily injury immediately or in the future to the person threatened or to any other person; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cause physical damage immediately or in the future to the property of a person threatened or that of any other person.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commission of a hate crime offense is a class C felony.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The penalties provided in this section for hate crime offenses do not preclude the victims from seeking any other remedies otherwise available under law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section confers or expands any civil rights or protections to any group or class identified under this section, beyond those rights or protections that exist under the federal or state Constitution or the civil laws of the state of Washington.</p>
</li>
</ol>
