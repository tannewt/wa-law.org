<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that over 500,000 women in the United States are at risk of or have undergone female genital mutilation, including 25,000 women and girls in Washington state. The legislature further finds that the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metro is among the five highest rates of impacted and at-risk communities in the United States, making addressing female genital mutilation and other sexual violence critical.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to expand the rights of survivors of sexual assault to survivors of all acts of sexual violence, including female genital mutilation. The legislature further intends to extend the life cycle of the SAFE advisory group and expand its duties to include researching and making recommendations on trauma-informed, culturally sensitive policies to prevent and address female genital mutilation and other acts of sexual violence.</p>
<p>The legislature declares that protection of victim witnesses in sexual assault and domestic violence cases is a substantial and compelling interest of the state. Sexual assault and domestic violence cases are some of the most difficult cases to prosecute. When sexual assault and domestic violence cases are prosecuted, a victim witness may suffer serious emotional and mental trauma from exposure to the defendant or from testifying in open court. In rare cases, the victim witness is so traumatized that the victim witness is unable to testify at trial and is unavailable as a witness, or the victim witness's ability to communicate in front of the defendant is so reduced that the truth-seeking function of trial is impaired. In other rare cases, the victim witness is able to proceed to trial but suffers long-lasting trauma as a result of testifying in court or in front of the defendant. This trauma is further exacerbated when questioned by a pro se defendant. A pro se defendant's unfettered access to the victim of sexual assault or domestic violence continues the psychological trauma inflicted upon the victim. The creation of procedural processes designed to enhance the truth-seeking process and to shield victim witnesses from the trauma of exposure to the defendant and the courtroom is a compelling state interest.</p>
<p>The legislature further declares that it intends to protect victim witnesses in sexual assault and domestic violence cases while upholding the rights of defendants under Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975), the Sixth Amendment to the federal Constitution, and Article I, section 22 of the state Constitution, by applying the balancing test for testimony of children witnesses by closed-circuit television in State v. Foster, 135 Wn.2d 441, 957 P.2d 712 (1998) to such victim witnesses. The legislature finds that applying the balancing test in State v. Foster when permitting the court to conduct, or appoint the use of standby counsel to conduct, all examination of victim witnesses on behalf of the pro se defendant in sexual assault and domestic violence cases is necessary to further the substantial and compelling state interest in protecting the welfare of the particular victim witness, would assure the reliability of the testimony of such a victim witness, and ensure that a defendant's Faretta rights are not infringed.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On motion of the prosecuting attorney in any criminal proceeding involving sexual assault or domestic violence in which the defendant is proceeding pro se, whether or not the motion is at the request of the victim witness, the court may conduct, or appoint standby counsel to conduct, all examination of the victim witness on behalf of the pro se defendant during trial if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The testimony will:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Describe an act or attempted act of sexual contact or sexual assault performed with or on the victim witness by another person; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe an act or attempted act of domestic violence against the victim witness by another person;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The testimony is taken during a criminal proceeding;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court finds by substantial evidence, in a hearing conducted outside the presence of the jury, that:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The victim witness involved would be traumatized;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The source of the trauma is not the courtroom generally, but the presence of the defendant; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The emotional or mental distress suffered by the victim witness would be more than de minimis;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court finds that the prosecutor has made all reasonable efforts to prepare the victim witness for testifying. If the prosecutor fails to demonstrate the preparations were implemented or the prosecutor in good faith attempted to implement them, the court shall deny the motion;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court balances the strength of the state's case without the testimony of the victim witness against the defendant's constitutional rights and the degree of infringement of having standby counsel or the court inquire of the witness;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court finds that no less restrictive method of obtaining the testimony exists that can adequately protect the victim witness from suffering emotional or mental distress that was more than de minimis; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the court conducts, or appoints standby counsel to conduct, all examination of the victim witness on behalf of the pro se defendant, the pro se defendant shall have the opportunity to write additional questions and have such questions asked if appropriate under the applicable evidentiary rules and case law. Reasonable court recesses must be granted to facilitate the pro se defendant's ability to meaningfully cross-examine a witness through standby counsel or the court.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the hearing conducted under subsection (1) of this section to determine if the court will conduct, or appoint standby counsel to conduct, all examination of a victim witness on behalf of the pro se defendant, the court may conduct the observation and examination of the victim upon request of the prosecutor. The pro se defendant shall have an opportunity to oppose the prosecutor's request to have standby counsel or the court conduct all examination on behalf of the pro se defendant. The pro se defendant may not have the opportunity to question the victim witness face-to-face at this hearing but may present arguments supporting the defendant's opposition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On motion of the prosecuting attorney in any criminal proceeding involving sexual assault or domestic violence in which the defendant is proceeding pro se, whether or not the motion is at the request of the victim witness, the court may appoint standby counsel or an investigator to conduct all examination of the victim witness on behalf of the pro se defendant during trial preparation if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The anticipated testimony will:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Describe an act or attempted act of sexual contact or sexual assault performed with or on the victim witness by another person; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe an act or attempted act of domestic violence against the victim witness by another person; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The anticipated testimony is taken for the purposes of preparing for a criminal proceeding.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court shall make particularized findings on the record articulating the factors upon which the court based its decision to appoint standby counsel to conduct, appoint an investigator to conduct, or have the court itself conduct all examination of the victim witness on behalf of the pro se defendant pursuant to this section. The factors the court may consider include, but are not limited to, consideration of: The victim witness's age, physical health, emotional stability, expressions of fear of being examined in open court by the defendant, and expressions of fear of being examined by the defendant during trial preparation; the relationship of the defendant to the victim witness; the nature of the underlying offense and the traumatization the victim witness will experience from being examined by the defendant; the victim witness's ability to testify in front of the defendant; and the specific nature or emotional or mental trauma the victim witness will suffer. The court's findings shall identify the impact the factors have upon the victim witness's ability to testify in front of the defendant and the specific nature of the emotional or mental trauma the victim witness would suffer. The court shall determine whether the source of the trauma is the defendant and may conduct, appoint standby counsel to conduct, or appoint an investigator to conduct, all examination of the victim witness on behalf of the pro se defendant pursuant to this section.</p>
