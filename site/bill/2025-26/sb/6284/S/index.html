<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that artificial intelligence is a dynamic technology that is changing the way Washingtonians live, learn, and work. Emerging artificial intelligence technologies seek to enhance information gathering and decision making, create new efficiencies throughout the economy, and advance scientific discovery. The legislature also recognizes that there are potential risks associated with the rapid development and deployment of artificial intelligence systems, including the generation of bias and unintentional discrimination. These risks are especially profound when an artificial intelligence system is used to make decisions that have a material or legal impact on someone's life.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes Washington's role as a leader and innovator within the high-technology economy. The legislature intends to adopt an artificial intelligence regulatory framework that continues to promote innovation, reduce risk, and protect residents from discriminatory actions. The legislature further recognizes that regulatory frameworks that align with national standards and specify clear compliance requirements provide developers with certainty to support continued innovation while also protecting consumers from unfair or unclear artificial intelligence decisions.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to protect Washingtonians from algorithmic discrimination by establishing a comprehensive risk-based approach to artificial intelligence accountability. The legislature intends to regulate deployers of artificial intelligence under the presumption that they are acting in good faith when they comply with the provisions of this act. The legislature also intends to ensure that government agencies are transparent and accountable by requiring disclosure when consumer interactions are supported by an artificial intelligence system. Finally, the legislature intends to extend and expand the work of the artificial intelligence task force to develop a framework for the adoption of artificial intelligence in the workplace in a way that centers workers and protects fairness and opportunity.</p>
