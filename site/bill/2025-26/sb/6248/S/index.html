<p>Travel protection plans may be offered for one price for the combined features that the travel protection plan offers in this state if:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The travel protection plan clearly discloses to the consumer, at or prior to the time of purchase, that it includes travel insurance, travel assistance services, and cancellation fee waivers as applicable, and provides information and an opportunity, at or prior to the time of purchase, for the consumer to obtain additional information regarding the features and pricing of each; and</p>

<h2 id="section-6">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>All persons offering travel insurance to residents of this state are subject to chapter 48.30 RCW, except as otherwise provided in this section. In the event of a conflict between this chapter and other provisions of this title regarding the sale and marketing of travel insurance and travel protection plans, the provisions of this chapter control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pursuant to section 12 of this act, offering or selling a travel insurance policy that could never result in payment of any claims for any insured under the policy is an unfair trade practice under chapter 48.30 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The marketing requirements in this subsection apply to travel insurance.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>All documents provided to consumers prior to the purchase of travel insurance including, but not limited to, sales materials, advertising materials, and marketing materials, must be consistent with the travel insurance policy itself including, but not limited to, forms, endorsements, policies, rate filings, and certificates of insurance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For travel insurance policies or certificates that contain preexisting condition exclusions, information and an opportunity to learn more about the preexisting condition exclusions must be provided any time prior to the time of purchase, and in the coverage's fulfillment materials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fulfillment materials and the information described in section 3(2)(a) of this act must be provided to a policyholder or certificate holder as soon as practicable, following the purchase of a travel protection plan.

For the purposes of this subsection, &quot;delivery&quot; means handing fulfillment materials to the policyholder or certificate holder or sending fulfillment materials by postal mail or electronic means to the policyholder or certificate holder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The company shall disclose in the policy documentation and fulfillment materials whether the travel insurance is primary or secondary to other applicable coverage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where travel insurance is marketed directly to a consumer through an insurer's website or by others through an aggregator site, it is not an unfair trade practice or other violation of law where an accurate summary or short description of coverage is provided on the web page, so long as the consumer has access to the full provisions of the policy through electronic means.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>No person offering, soliciting, or negotiating travel insurance or travel protection plans on an individual or group basis may do so by using negative option or opt out, which would require a consumer to take an affirmative action to deselect coverage, such as unchecking a box on an electronic form, when the consumer purchases a trip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pursuant to section 12 of this act, it is an unfair trade practice to market blanket travel insurance coverage as free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where a consumer's destination jurisdiction requires insurance coverage, it is not an unfair trade practice to require that a consumer choose between the following options as a condition of purchasing a trip or travel package:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Purchasing the coverage required by the destination jurisdiction through the travel retailer or limited lines travel insurance producer supplying the trip or travel package; or</p>
