# SB 5754 - Washington state public bank

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5754.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that Washington state needs to drastically increase our public financing capacity without raising taxes on working families or financial debt obligations of the state.

The legislature finds that the infrastructure needs of our state far outstrip our ability to finance them under our current public financing model, which relies heavily on bonding. This reliance on bonding diverts much needed and hard-earned tax revenues of our taxpayers from critical programs that benefit them and the state.

The legislature finds that public financing for public benefit is a much better strategy than private financing for public benefit and that most of the developed world uses public banks to finance public initiatives. Publicly owned banking is a much more efficient model for public financing and is proven and used around the world. The United States is more an anomaly than the norm in depending on private banking and investments to finance public initiatives.

The legislature further finds that there exists one public financing model in the United States, which is the Bank of North Dakota. The Bank of North Dakota is the only public depository banking model in the United States that is owned by the people of the state and has existed for over 100 years, overcoming tremendous opposition efforts by the banking industry and financiers to squash it. It regularly reports record annual profits for the people of the state of North Dakota, who are very proud of their public institution because it benefits their economy and supports economic development, supports local community banks, provides access to capital for small businesses and farmers, aids the state in times of disasters, can lower borrowing costs, streamlines government, creates profits for the people, and is generally recognized as a tremendous asset for the state.

The legislature finds that our state has many revolving loan accounts that do good work, but they are limited in the sense that they can only lend as much money as is in the account and can only lend more money after the accounts have been repaid. Examples of these accounts are the public works assistance account, accounts for the community economic revitalization board, the transportation infrastructure bank (which is not a depository bank), and more. These accounts would be able to lend well beyond their current appropriated capacity when powered by a publicly owned depository bank where the deposits allow leveraging of the bank's core capital capacity.

The legislature finds that, based on a 2023 report, Moody's calculates that Washington state has the fifth highest level of debt service as a percentage of general fund revenues amongst all states.

Senate Bill No. 5194 (2025), this year's capital budget bond bill, proposes issuing $5 billion of bonds this biennium to finance our capital budget. To do a general calculation of the total cost of $5 billion in bonds over 20 years, the bond's face value, $5 billion, would need to be multiplied by the total interest accrued over the term of the bonds, 20 years, which depends on the interest rate of the bond. The 20-year treasury bond issued on January 31, 2025, had a rate of 4.625 percent.

The legislature finds that bond costs including fees can double the costs of financing or more, depending on the interest rates at the time of issuance. For example, if a $5 billion bond had a five percent annual interest rate maturing in 20 years, the total cost of the $5 billion bond to the state's general fund would be $10 billion. The interest per year would be $5 billion multiplied by five percent, which equals $250 million. The total cost would be $5 billion, the bond principal, plus $5 billion, the total interest, which equals $10 billion. Similarly, the total cost of the same $5 billion bonds over 30 years is: $5 billion, the principal, plus $7.5 billion, the interest, equals $12.5 billion.

The legislature finds that creating a state-owned depository bank and, for example, keeping $500 million in reserves in the publicly owned bank would safely leverage out to provide the same $5 billion in financing capacity necessary to fund the capital budget without the need for a Senate Bill No. 5194-type bond bill. A state-owned depository bank would help meet our infrastructure financing needs without raising taxes or increasing debt obligation of the state's general fund, allowing the general fund to be fully used for the benefit of the people rather than providing profits for Wall Street investors.

The legislature finds that fractional reserve banking is standard banking practice in the United States and around the world. It is a banking system where banks keep a portion of deposits on reserve and lend the rest. This system allows banks to create loans and expand the economy. While the United States has no specific reserve requirement, a 10 percent reserve is standard banking practice and considered safe under standard banking regulations and practices and given other forms of access to liquidity. In other words, $1 billion held in reserves in a publicly owned depository bank and leveraged with our tax revenue as deposits would provide $10 billion in loan capacity and would generate profits for the people of the state through interest rate of return on the $10 billion as loans. This would amount to a tenfold increase in the infrastructure financing capacity of the original $1 billion, stimulate our economy, and create jobs, while simultaneously lowering borrowing costs and still making a profit for the people of the state.

For example, if a revolving loan account of $1 billion lends all $1 billion at five percent interest, the account makes $50 million in interest. However, that same $1 billion held in any commercial depository bank charging five percent interest can leverage those same funds up to 10 times and makes profits for shareholders of $500 million. A publicly owned depository bank can charge whatever lower interest rate it chooses, for example two percent, or it can charge zero percent for some smaller loans financing the most emergent needs and supported by the legislature, and still make money for the people. $1 billion multiplied by two percent and 10, the leverage, equals a $200 million profit for the people, and the low interest loans it makes to the state and local governments go back into Washington's local economies, fund needed programs in our state, and create jobs rather than profits for large banks, bond brokers, and investment firms.

The legislature finds that the state and political subdivisions already hold billions of dollars in reserves and accounts, which can be held in the publicly owned depository bank and can be used either as equity capital or general deposits in a depository account.

The legislature finds that, through a state publicly owned bank, the state could borrow from itself at rates the state decides, and repay the state, thereby growing the state's capacity to finance more infrastructure while also making profits for the people of the state, not for Wall Street investors. A state-owned bank would allow the state to keep tax revenues in the state and working for the state instead of exporting tax revenues as an engine for profits to Wall Street investors.

The legislature finds that banks use deposits to leverage the capital that owners have used to create the bank, known as equity capital. A fundamental standard banking practice is that banks can use their deposits to leverage the lending capacity of their equity capital up to tenfold, which is accepted throughout the banking industry as safe and standard banking practice.

The legislature finds that by creating a bank, which is owned by the people of the state of Washington, and using it as the depository for taxes paid by the people of the state instead of using Wall Street banks, the state of Washington could recapture the power of our tax dollars for the benefit of the state and drastically increase our public financing capacity by an order of magnitude and at lower costs without raising taxes or increasing state debt.

The legislature intends to create a depository bank, owned and operated for the beneficial interests of the people of the state of Washington. The state shall, and political subdivisions may, use this publicly owned bank as the primary depository institution for tax revenue and other funds currently held at large financial institutions. The state and political subdivisions are not prohibited from holding some deposits in local community banks, credit unions, or other financial institutions when it serves the best interests of the people.

The legislature intends for the state treasurer to transfer as much of the state's general fund and concentration account into the publicly owned depository bank as is deemed necessary and prudent by the board to facilitate the growth of the bank with the goal of eventually transferring all state moneys currently held in deposit at large Wall Street banks.

The legislature further intends for this public depository bank to follow best banking and prudent management practices with appropriate levels of transparency, accountability, integrity, and oversight by the appropriate financial industry regulatory institutions. The legislature further intends for the board to ensure the long-term financial success of the bank as a foundational facility for future generations of Washingtonians to address the needs of their time, which are impossible to predict now other than to recognize the state will need resources to achieve the state's goals, which this bank will provide.

The legislature further intends for this public depository bank to provide adequate financing capacity and access to capital for local governments in the state to finance infrastructure, support educational, housing, transportation, health care, and economic development, and other unmet infrastructure and banking and lending needs of local governments, the state, and the people, and, to the greatest extent possible, reduce costs of borrowed money to taxpayers and residents of the state. The legislature further intends for the best interests of the people to be the paramount duty of the publicly owned depository bank.

The bonds are not obligations of the state of Washington, may not create state debt, and are obligations only of the public bank payable from the special fund or funds created by the public bank for their payment. Such funds are not public moneys or funds of the state of Washington and at all times must be kept segregated and set apart from other funds.

2. Bonds issued under this chapter must contain a recital on their face to the effect that payment of the principal of, interest on, and prepayment premium, if any, on the bonds, is a valid claim only as against the special fund or funds relating thereto, that neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the state or any municipal corporation, subdivision, or agency of the state, other than the public bank as set forth in this chapter, is pledged to the payment of the principal of, interest on, and prepayment premium, if any, on the bonds. Contracts entered into by the public bank must be entered into in the name of the public bank and not in the name of the state of Washington. The obligations of the public bank under the contracts must be obligations only of the public bank and are not in any way obligations of the state of Washington.

4. The bonds of the public bank are subject to such terms, conditions, covenants, and protective provisions as are found necessary or desirable by the public bank including, but not limited to, pledges of the public bank's assets, setting aside of reserves, limitations on additional forms of indebtedness, and the mortgaging of all or any part of the public bank's real or personal property, then owned or thereafter acquired, and other provisions the public bank finds are necessary or desirable for the security of bond owners.

5. Any bonds issued under this chapter may be secured by a financing document between the public bank and the purchasers or owners of such bonds or between the public bank and a corporate trustee appointed by the public bank, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. The financing document may pledge or assign, in whole or in part, the revenues and funds held or to be received by the public bank, any present or future contract or other rights to receive the same, and the proceeds thereof. The financing document must contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights, security, and remedies of bond owners as may be reasonable and proper including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, provisions defining defaults and providing for remedies in the event of default which may include the acceleration of maturities, restrictions on the individual rights of action by bond owners, and covenants setting forth duties of and limitations on the public bank in conduct of its programs and the management of its property. In addition to other security provided in this chapter or otherwise by law, bonds issued by the public bank may be secured, in whole or in part, by a pledge of the assets of the public bank, including contributions of the members, or by financial guaranties, insurance or letters of credit issued to the public bank or a trustee or any other person, by any bank, trust company, insurance or surety company, or other financial institution, within or without the state. The public bank may pledge or assign, in whole or in part, the revenues and funds held or to be received by the public bank, any present or future contract or other rights to receive the same, and the proceeds thereof, as security for such guaranties or insurance or for the reimbursement by the public bank to any issuer of such letter of credit of any payments made under such letter of credit. No individual member is liable to the public bank, to the public bank's trustee, or to any other person in amounts exceeding the member's contribution unless authorized by a majority of the members of the public bank.

    a. Pay the borrower's share of the fees established by the public bank;

    b. Pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on outstanding bonds of the public bank issued in respect of such borrower as the same shall become due and payable; and

    c. Create and maintain reserves required or provided for by the public bank in connection with the issuance of such bonds. The payments are not subject to supervision or regulation by any department, committee, board, body, bureau, or agency of the state other than the public bank.

7. Any security interest created in the unexpended bond proceeds and in the special funds created by the public bank must be immediately valid and binding against such moneys and any securities in which such moneys may be invested without public bank or trustee possession thereof, and the security interest is prior to any party having any competing claim in such moneys or securities, without filing or recording pursuant to chapter 62A.9A RCW and regardless of whether the party has notice of the security interest.

8. When issuing bonds, the public bank may provide for the future issuance of additional bonds or parity debt on a parity with outstanding bonds, and the terms and conditions of their issuance. The public bank may refund or advance refund any bond of the public bank in accordance with chapter 39.53 RCW or issue bonds with a subordinate lien against the fund or funds securing outstanding bonds. Bonds issued for refunding purposes may be combined with bonds issued for the financing or refinancing of new projects. Pending the application of the proceeds of the refunding bonds to the redemption of the bonds to be redeemed, the public bank may enter into an agreement or agreements with a corporate trustee regarding the interim investment of the proceeds and the application of the proceeds and the earnings on the proceeds to the payment of the principal of and interest on, and the redemption of, the bonds to be redeemed.

9. All money received by or on behalf of the public bank with respect to this issuance of its bonds are trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this chapter. The public bank, instead of receiving and applying the moneys itself, may enter into a trust agreement or indenture with one or more banks, including the national cooperative bank, or trust companies having the power and bank to conduct trust business in the state to:

    a. Perform all or any part of the obligations of the public bank with respect to: (i) Bonds issued by it; (ii) the receipt, investment, and application of the proceeds of the bonds and money paid by a participant or available from other sources for the payment of the bonds; (iii) the enforcement of the obligations of a borrower in connection with the financing or refinancing of any project; and (iv) other matters relating to the exercise of the public bank's powers under this chapter;

    b. Receive, hold, preserve, and enforce any security interest or evidence of security interest granted by a participant for purposes of securing the payment of the bonds; and

    c. Act on behalf of the public bank or the owners of bonds of the public bank for purposes of assuring or enforcing the payment of the bonds, when due.

11. The chair of the state finance committee or the chair's designee must be notified in advance of the issuance of bonds by the public bank in order to promote the orderly offering of obligations in the financial markets.

12. Neither the members of the public bank, nor its directors or agents, nor employees of the office of the state treasurer, nor any person executing the bonds, is personally liable on the bonds or subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance of the bonds.

13. The public bank may, out of any fund available therefor, purchase its bonds in the open market.

14. Any owner of bonds of the public bank issued under this chapter, and the trustee under any trust agreement or indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceeding, protect and enforce any of their respective rights, and may become the purchaser at any foreclosure sale if the person is the highest bidder, except to the extent the rights given are restricted by the public bank in any bond resolution or trust agreement or indenture authorizing the issuance of the bonds.

15. The public bank may charge for its costs and services in review or consideration of a proposed loan to a state, local, or tribal government, whether or not the loan is made.

16.
