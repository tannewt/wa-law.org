<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The department must review and either approve or reject special license plate applications submitted by sponsoring organizations. Except for special license plates created under this act, the department may not issue any new special license plates until January 1, 2029, and therefore no applications for any new special license plates may be accepted until January 1, 2029. The department must prominently display this special license plate moratorium on its website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duties of the department include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Review and approve the annual financial reports submitted by sponsoring organizations with active special license plate series and present those annual financial reports to the joint transportation committee;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Report annually to the joint transportation committee on the special license plate applications that were considered by the department;</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The high cost of implementing a new special license plate series, coupled with the uncertainty of the state's ability to recoup its costs, has led the legislature to delay the implementation of new special license plates. In order to address these issues, it is the intent of the legislature to create a mechanism that will allow for the opportunity to review and evaluate the special license plate process, to ensure efficacy of the program, and to ensure this program does not result in undue costs to the state of Washington.</p>
</li>
<li>
