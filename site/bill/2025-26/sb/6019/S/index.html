<pre><code>a. The following members shall be voting members:

    i. One representative from the  office of the governor;

    ii. One representative from the department;

    iii. One representative from each consumer directed employer; and

    iv. One designee from the exclusive bargaining representative of individual providers or, in the absence of an exclusive bargaining representative, a designee from the consumer directed employer workforce chosen by the employees of the consumer directed employer.

c. The  appointments by the governor shall be made by April 1st in even-numbered years. The incumbent member of the board shall serve until their replacement is appointed.
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>When the board membership has four voting members listed in subsection (1)(a) of this section, each voting member shall have one vote. When there are five voting members due to two consumer directed employer representatives, each voting member listed in subsection (1)(a) of this section shall have two votes with the exception of the consumer directed employer representatives who shall have one vote. Voting members cannot split their votes. A majority of the voting members of the board constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business and is necessary for any action taken by the board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning in the year following the establishment of the initial rate , and in every even-numbered year thereafter, the rate-setting board shall attempt to determine a proposed labor rate, including a specific amount for health and training benefits by considering the factors listed in RCW 41.56.530 (1) and (5). In addition, the rate-setting board shall attempt to determine an administrative rate for the consumer directed employer. In determining the consumer directed employer administrative rate, the rate-setting board may not recommend a rate that represents more than 20 percent of the sum of the consumer directed employer labor rate and the consumer directed employer administrative rate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, the rate-setting board shall review the projection from the department of the portion of the vendor rate dedicated to the wages and benefits for home care agency workers who provide direct care and the required employer contributions or premiums established in RCW 74.39A.310. The rate-setting board shall take testimony and shall attempt to determine a home care agency administrative rate.

<li>
<p>At the commencement of the  rate-setting activities of the board, the voting members must first attempt to select an additional voting member, who will chair the rate-setting board and will cast a tie-breaking vote if the voting members identified in subsection (1) of this section are unable to pass by majority vote on the labor rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the first occasion that the voting members identified in subsection (1)(a) of this section fail to select a tie-breaking member by a majority vote, the chair member will be selected as follows:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The voting member representing the  office of the governor shall request a list of five qualified arbitrators, or six if there are two consumer directed employers, from the federal mediation and conciliation service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a majority of the voting members of the board cannot agree on the selection of a neutral arbitrator from the list, the representative from the consumer directed employer who first contacted the department will strike a name from the list first. The representative from the  office of the governor shall then strike a name from the list, the designee from the exclusive bargaining representative or, in the absence of an exclusive bargaining representative, the designee from the consumer directed employer workforce shall strike a name from the list, if there are two consumer directed employers, the second representative will strike a name from the list, and finally the representative from the department shall strike a name from the list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The name of the arbitrator remaining after the final strike shall be the chair member of the board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If that person is not willing or available to be the chair member, the second to last person remaining on the list shall be asked to be the chair member. If the second to last person is not willing or available, the third to last person shall be asked to be the chair member. This process of selecting an arbitrator shall be continued until a chair member of the board is appointed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the next occasion that the voting members identified in subsection (1)(a) of this section fail to select a chair member by a majority vote, the chair member will be selected using the method described in (b) of this subsection except that the order of board members striking names from the list, described in (b)(ii) of this subsection, shall be reversed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On each successive occasion that the voting members identified in subsection (1)(a) of this section fail to select a chair member by a majority vote, the order of voting members striking names from the list will continue to alternate between the order described in (b)(ii) and (c) of this subsection.</p>

<p>If an agreement on a proposed administrative rate for the consumer directed employer or a home care agency administrative rate, or both, is not reached by a majority of the voting members of the rate-setting board prior to September 1st, then the administrative rate for the consumer directed employer or the home care agency administrative rate, or both, shall be determined by the department. In determining the home care agency administrative rate, the department may not recommend a rate that represents more than 20 percent of the home care agency vendor rate. In determining the consumer directed employer administrative rate, the department may not recommend a rate that represents more than 20 percent of the sum of the consumer directed employer labor rate and the consumer directed employer administrative rate.</p>

<li>
<p>After the rates have been determined in accordance with subsections (2) through (5) of this section, they shall be submitted to the director of the office of financial management by October 1st prior to the legislative session during which the requests are to be considered for review. If the director of the office of financial management certifies them as being feasible financially for the state, the governor shall include a request for funds necessary to implement the proposed rates as part of the  budget document submitted by the office of the governor under RCW 43.88.030 and 43.88.060. The legislature shall approve or reject the request for funds as a whole.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the legislature rejects the request under subsection (5) of this section, the matter shall return to the rate-setting board established under this section for further consideration. Until the legislature approves a request for funds under this section, the current labor rate shall stay in effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The labor rate approved by the legislature shall be an hourly rate paid to the consumer directed employer. The labor rate shall be used exclusively for paying the wages, associated taxes, and benefits of individual providers. The consumer directed employer shall have full discretion to set wages and benefits for individual providers, except as provided in: (a) Subsections (9) and (10) of this section; (b) any specific legislative appropriation requirement; or (c) a collective bargaining agreement, if applicable.</p>

<li>
<p>The department finds the changes to the rates necessary to:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Recognize changes to the  required expenditures for the department or the  required costs for the consumer directed employer associated with changes to tax rates, required employer contributions, mileage rate allowances, and utilization of overtime to comply with RCW 74.39A.525;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comply with a significant change in state or federal rule or law that would impact the  ability of the consumer directed employer to operate; or</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>For the purpose of this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Labor rate&quot; is defined as that portion of the  hourly rate for the consumer directed employer that is to be used by the consumer directed employer to compensate its workers, including wages, benefits, and any associated taxes.</p>
