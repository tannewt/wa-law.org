<p>The legislature finds that students receiving special education services are entitled, under both federal and state law, to a free appropriate public education that enables their full participation.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that special education is part of the state's statutory program of basic education that is deemed by the legislature to implement Article IX, section 1 of the state Constitution.</p>

<li>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction shall submit to each regular session of the legislature during an odd-numbered year a programmed budget request for special education programs for students with disabilities. Funding for programs operated by local school districts shall be on an excess cost basis from appropriations provided by the legislature for special education programs for students with disabilities and shall take account of state funds accruing through RCW 28A.150.260 (4)(a), (5), (6), and (8) and 28A.150.415.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The excess cost allocation to school districts shall be based on the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>A district's annual average head count enrollment of students ages three and four and those five year olds not yet enrolled in kindergarten who are eligible for and receiving special education, multiplied by the district's base allocation per full-time equivalent student, multiplied by 1.32;</li>
</ol>
<p>b.A district's annual average enrollment of resident students who are eligible for and receiving special education, excluding students ages three and four and those five year olds not yet enrolled in kindergarten, multiplied by either the district's base allocation per full-time equivalent student or the state average base allocation per full-time equivalent student, whichever is greater, multiplied by the special education cost multiplier rate of</p>

<p>The superintendent of public instruction may reserve amounts up to .005 of the funding generated under subsection (2) of this section to use for statewide special education activities outlined in section 5 of this act.</p>

<li>
<p>As used in this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;District's base allocation&quot; means the total state allocation to all schools in the district generated by the distribution formula under RCW 28A.150.260 (4)(a), (5), (6), and (8) and the allocation under RCW 28A.150.415, to be divided by the district's full-time equivalent enrollment.</p>

<p>To the extent necessary, funds shall be made available for safety net awards for districts with demonstrated needs for special education funding beyond the amounts provided through the special education funding formula under RCW 28A.150.390.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the federal safety net awards based on the federal eligibility threshold exceed the federal appropriation in any fiscal year, then the superintendent shall expend all available federal discretionary funds necessary to meet this need.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safety net funds shall be awarded by the state safety net oversight committee subject to the following conditions and limitations:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The committee shall award additional funds for districts that can convincingly demonstrate that all legitimate expenditures for special education exceed all available revenues from state funding formulas. When determining award eligibility and amounts, the committee shall limit its review to relevant documentation that illustrates adherence to award criteria. The committee shall not make determinations regarding the content of individualized education programs beyond confirming documented and quantified services and evidence of corresponding expenditures for which a school district seeks reimbursement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the determination of need, the committee shall consider additional available revenues from federal sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differences in program costs attributable to district philosophy, service delivery choice, or accounting practices are not a legitimate basis for safety net awards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the determination of need, the committee shall require that districts demonstrate that they are maximizing their eligibility for all state revenues related to services for students eligible for special education and all federal revenues from federal impact aid, medicaid, and the individuals with disabilities education act-Part B and appropriate special projects. Awards associated with (e)  of this subsection shall not exceed the total of a district's specific determination of need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The committee shall then consider the extraordinary high cost needs of one or more individual students eligible for and receiving special education. Differences in costs attributable to district philosophy, service delivery choice, or accounting practices are not a legitimate basis for safety net awards.</p>

<p>The committee shall then consider the extraordinary high cost needs of one or more individual students eligible for and receiving special education served in residential schools, programs for juveniles under the department of corrections, and programs for juveniles operated by city and county jails to the extent they are providing a secondary program of education.</p>
<pre><code>g. The maximum allowable indirect cost for calculating safety net eligibility may not exceed the federal restricted indirect cost rate for the district plus one percent.

h. Safety net awards shall be adjusted based on the percent of potential medicaid eligible students billed as calculated by the superintendent of public instruction in accordance with chapter 318, Laws of 1999.

    i. Safety net awards must be adjusted for any unresolved audit findings or exceptions related to special education funding. Safety net awards may only be adjusted for errors in safety net applications or individualized education programs that materially affect the demonstration of need.

<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction shall adopt such rules and procedures as are necessary to administer the special education funding and safety net award process.  Before revising any standards, procedures, or rules, the superintendent shall consult with the office of financial management and the fiscal committees of the legislature. In adopting and revising the rules, the superintendent shall ensure the application process to access safety net funding is streamlined, timelines for submission are not in conflict, feedback to school districts is timely and provides sufficient information to allow school districts to understand how to correct any deficiencies in a safety net application, and that there is consistency between awards approved by school district and by application period.

<p>On an annual basis, the superintendent shall survey districts regarding their satisfaction with the safety net process and consider feedback from districts to improve the safety net process. Each year by December 1st, the superintendent shall prepare and submit a report to the office of financial management and the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the legislature that summarizes the survey results and those changes made to the safety net process as a result of the school district feedback.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By December 1, 2024, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must develop a survey requesting specific feedback on the safety net application process from school districts with 3,000 or fewer students. The survey must include, at a minimum, questions regarding the average amount of time school district staff spend gathering safety net application data, filling out application forms, and correcting application deficiencies. The survey must also include questions to help identify which application components are the most challenging and time consuming for school districts to complete. By December 1, 2025, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must use this feedback to implement a simplified, standardized safety net application for all school districts that reduces barriers to safety net funding.</p>

<p>6.Beginning in the 2025-26 school year, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must distribute safety net awards to school districts on a quarterly basis if the following criteria are met:</p>
<pre><code>a. The safety net award is provided for a high cost student who receives special education services from an authorized entity, as defined under RCW 28A.300.690, located outside of the state of Washington;

b. The school district successfully applied for and received a safety net award for the high cost student in a prior school year and the student's placement has not changed since that safety net award was granted; and

c. The school district meets all other safety net award eligibility requirements as determined by the safety net oversight committee.
