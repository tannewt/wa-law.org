# SB 5798 - Property tax

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5798.pdf)

## Section 101
The legislature finds that the arbitrary one percent limitation on the growth of property tax collections has severely inhibited the ability of the state, counties, cities, and special purpose districts to provide critical services in the face of significant population growth and inflation.

Modifying the limitation on the growth of property tax collections will restore the primary tool state legislators use to fund public schools and the primary tool that county and city governments use to fund law enforcement, the criminal justice system, fire departments, and other services Washingtonians rely on.

## Section 102
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Inflation" means the annual percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers in the western region for all items as provided in the most recent 12-month period by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of labor by July 25th of the year before the taxes are payable.

2. "Limit factor" means:

    a.

the greater of 100 percent plus population change and inflation or 101 percent; or

    b. For cities, counties, and towns, with respect to the current expense levy of such jurisdictions, the greater of a limit factor under RCW 84.55.0101 or 101 percent.

3. [Empty]

    a. "Population change" means the annual percent increase in the population of a taxing district between the two most recent years as provided in the official population estimates published by the office of financial management for April 1st of the year before taxes are payable. For a county, the "population of a taxing district" means the population within the county's incorporated and unincorporated areas, unless the county taxing district boundaries are limited to the unincorporated county areas, except for a county road fund levy, in which case the "population of a taxing district" means the population of the unincorporated county areas only. Except for the state, for taxing districts that are not coterminous with one or more cities, towns, counties, or unincorporated county areas, or any combination thereof, as provided in the official population estimates published by the office of financial management in April of the year before the taxes are payable, "population change" means:

        i. The population change for the city or town within which the taxing district is wholly located;

        ii. The population change for the county in which the taxing district is wholly located, when the taxing district is not wholly located within a city or town; or

        iii. For taxing districts located in more than one county, the county population change for the county in which the greatest total taxable assessed value of the taxing district for the prior assessment year is located.

    b. For the purposes of this subsection (3), the annual percent increase in population is calculated to the nearest 0.1 percent, rounding up to the next 0.1 percent if the second decimal place of the annual percent increase is five or greater.

4. "Regular property taxes" has the meaning given it in RCW 84.04.140.

## Section 103
1. The property tax limitation contained in this chapter shall be determined by the county assessors of the respective counties in accordance with the provisions of this chapter: PROVIDED, That the limitation for any state levy shall be determined by the department of revenue and the limitation for any intercounty rural library district shall be determined by the library district in consultation with the respective county assessors.

2. By October 1, 2025, and by October 1st every year thereafter, the county assessor must determine the limit factor applicable to each taxing district in their county and notify each taxing district of the determination. However, for a taxing district located in more than one county, the assessor of the county with the most assessed value of the taxing district is subject to the requirements of this subsection (2).

3. By September 1, 2025, and by September 1st every year thereafter, the department of revenue must provide county assessors the limit factors necessary for the county assessor to comply with subsections (1) and (2) of this section.

## Section 104
1. Upon a finding of substantial need, the legislative authority of a county, city, or town, with respect to its current expense levy, may provide for the use of a limit factor of 100 percent plus population change and inflation. The finding of substantial need must include a legislatively declared determination by the county, city, or town that the estimated increase in expenditures for public safety, criminal justice, and community protection services will exceed the estimated increase in available resources for those purposes.

2. For the purpose of this section, "public safety, criminal justice, and community protection services" means public safety, criminal justice, mental health, chemical dependency, emergency medical, domestic violence, and all other services eligible for funding under RCW 82.14.320, 82.14.340, 82.14.450, 82.14.460, and 84.52.069.

1. [Empty]

    a. The property taxes must have been imposed upon a residence which was occupied by the person claiming the exemption as a principal place of residence as of the time of filing. However, any person who sells, transfers, or is displaced from his or her residence may transfer his or her exemption status to a replacement residence, but no claimant may receive an exemption on more than one residence in any year. Moreover, confinement of the person to a hospital, nursing home, assisted living facility, adult family home, or home of a relative for the purpose of long-term care does not disqualify the claim of exemption if:

        i. The residence is temporarily unoccupied;

        ii. The residence is occupied by a spouse or a domestic partner and/or a person financially dependent on the claimant for support; or

        iii. The residence is rented for the purpose of paying nursing home, hospital, assisted living facility, or adult family home costs.

The person claiming the exemption must have owned, at the time of filing, in fee, as a life estate, or by contract purchase, the residence on which the property taxes have been imposed or if the person claiming the exemption lives in a cooperative housing association, corporation, or partnership, such person must own a share therein representing the unit or portion of the structure in which he or she resides. For purposes of this subsection, a residence owned by a marital community or state registered domestic partnership or owned by cotenants is deemed to be owned by each spouse or each domestic partner or each cotenant, and any lease for life is deemed a life estate;

3. [Empty]

    a. The person claiming the exemption must be:

4. [Empty]

    a. The amount that the person is exempt from an obligation to pay is calculated on the basis of combined disposable income, as defined in RCW 84.36.383.

    b. If the person claiming the exemption was retired for two months or more of the assessment year, the combined disposable income of such person must be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of such person during the months such person was retired by 12.

    c. If the income of the person claiming exemption is reduced for two or more months of the assessment year by reason of the death of the person's spouse or the person's domestic partner, or when other substantial changes occur in disposable income that are likely to continue for an indefinite period of time, the combined disposable income of such person must be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of such person after such occurrences by 12.

    d. [Empty]

        i. If the income of the person claiming the exemption increases as a result of a cost-of-living adjustment to social security benefits or supplemental security income in an amount that would disqualify the applicant from eligibility, the applicant is not disqualified but instead maintains eligibility.

        ii. The continued eligibility under this subsection applies to applications for property taxes levied for collection in calendar year 2024.

    e. If it is necessary to estimate income to comply with this subsection (4), the assessor may require confirming documentation of such income prior to May 31st of the year following application;

5. [Empty]

    a. A person who otherwise qualifies under this section and has a combined disposable income equal to or less than income threshold 3 is exempt from all excess property taxes, the additional state property tax imposed under RCW 84.52.065(2), and the portion of the regular property taxes authorized pursuant to RCW 84.55.050 and approved by the voters, if the legislative authority of the county or city imposing the additional regular property taxes identified this exemption in the ordinance placing the RCW 84.55.050 measure on the ballot;

    b. [Empty]

        i. A person who otherwise qualifies under this section and has a combined disposable income equal to or less than income threshold 2 but greater than income threshold 1 is exempt from all regular property taxes on the greater of $50,000 or 35 percent of the valuation of his or her residence, but not to exceed $70,000 of the valuation of his or her residence; or

If the person subsequently fails to qualify under this section only for one year because of high income, this same valuation must be used upon requalification. If the person fails to qualify for more than one year in succession because of high income or fails to qualify for any other reason, the valuation upon requalification is the assessed value on January 1st of the assessment year in which the person requalifies. If the person transfers the exemption under this section to a different residence, the valuation of the different residence is the assessed value of the different residence on January 1st of the assessment year in which the person transfers the exemption.

    b. In no event may the valuation under this subsection be greater than the true and fair value of the residence on January 1st of the assessment year.

    c. This subsection does not apply to subsequent improvements to the property in the year in which the improvements are made. Subsequent improvements to the property must be added to the value otherwise determined under this subsection at their true and fair value in the year in which they are made.

## Section 202
1. Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in RCW 84.55.010, state property taxes under RCW 84.52.065(1) levied for collection in calendar year 2026 must be reduced as necessary to prevent the exemption created under section 201, chapter . . ., Laws of 2025 (section 201 of this act) from resulting in a higher tax rate than would have occurred in the absence of the exemption.

2.
