<h2 id="section-101">Section 101 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-101">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the arbitrary one percent limitation on the growth of property tax collections has severely inhibited the ability of the state, counties, cities, and special purpose districts to provide critical services in the face of significant population growth and inflation.</p>
<p>Modifying the limitation on the growth of property tax collections will restore the primary tool state legislators use to fund public schools and the primary tool that county and city governments use to fund law enforcement, the criminal justice system, fire departments, and other services Washingtonians rely on.</p>
