# SB 5436 - Interfering with access to a place of religious worship.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5436.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that access to places of worship is imperative to the free exercise of religion in the state of Washington and that impaired access to places of worship raises substantial concerns regarding public safety and congestion of public thoroughfares. Ensuring the safety and unimpeded access of individuals entering and exiting places of worship is therefore a compelling government interest and essential for the immediate preservation of public peace, health, and safety. Toward that end, this chapter is aimed at making unlawful conduct that would interfere with a person's lawful exercise of that person's religious freedom under the state Constitution and United States Constitution. The legislature further finds that the protection of such persons from such interference can be accomplished without infringing on constitutionally protected speech or activity and affirms that its intent is to not seek to favor one viewpoint over another or to limit speech regarding any specific topic.

## Section 2
