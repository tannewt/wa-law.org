<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that, when it established the department of children, youth, and families, it also created an independent oversight board to ensure transparency, accountability, and public confidence in the department's operations and decision making. The legislature further recognizes that, since the department's inception, both the agency and the oversight structure have evolved, and that the existing statutory framework no longer reflects the present scope, functions, or operations of either entity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that a modernized oversight structure is necessary to promote effective collaboration between the department and its oversight body, ensure accountability for outcomes, and provide clear statutory direction consistent with the department's current stage of development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to reconstitute the existing oversight board as the department of children, youth, and families accountability board. The legislature intends that this new board retain its independent accountability role while operating under clarified authority, streamlined statutory provisions, and updated responsibilities that focus on policy review, performance monitoring, and public transparency. The legislature further intends to remove obsolete or duplicative provisions, align oversight activities with current departmental priorities, and strengthen the mechanisms through which the department and the oversight body coordinate to advance the well-being of Washington's children, youth, and families.</p>
