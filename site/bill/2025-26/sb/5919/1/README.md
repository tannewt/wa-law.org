    a. Installation and maintenance of defensible space or fire breaks;

    b. Proper equipment storage;

    c. Installation and maintenance of water tanks;

    d. Ownership of equipment related to wildfire mitigation including, but not limited to, a firefighting apparatus, tractor, or disc harrow; and

    e. Notification for local red flag warnings.
