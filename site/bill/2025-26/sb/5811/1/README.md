# SB 5811 - Zero-emission vehicle prg.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5811.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that the zero-emission vehicle program is a key policy supporting state efforts to achieve greenhouse gas emissions reductions required in RCW 70A.45.020. The advanced clean cars and advanced clean cars II components of the zero-emission vehicle program require manufacturers of passenger cars and light duty trucks to achieve an escalating minimum percentage of zero-emission vehicles for sale or lease in Washington, or to obtain surplus credits from an auto manufacturer that has exceeded this minimum compliance obligation. By providing for the creation of these tradeable and bankable credits, the program creates an incentive for vehicle manufacturers to maximize their investments in developing and selling cleaner cars. The legislature also finds that the creation of these tradeable and bankable credits creates the opportunity for a financial windfall accruing to firms that are not burdened by the legacy production of internal combustion engine vehicles that make a compliance obligation more difficult under the program. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to address this unintended outcome by taxing the windfall profits from the generation of surplus zero-emission vehicle credits and reinvesting those funds in other programs and incentives that promote cleaner vehicles that further state climate goals.

## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Banked" means a ZEV credit that a manufacturer has carried over for use in future model years in which a manufacturer has a shortfall or for use to offset a manufacturer's deficit carried over from a previous model year.

Manufacturers must report the information required under this subsection by October 31st for the previous model year of the zero-emission vehicle program.

3. Unaggregated information pertaining to the price of zero-emission vehicle credits in an individual zero-emission vehicle credit transaction is financial, commercial, and proprietary information exempt from public disclosure under chapter 42.56 RCW. Information related to the price of zero-emission vehicle credits in an individual zero-emission vehicle credit transaction under subsection (2) of this section must be aggregated by a time period no more frequent than the calendar quarter in which the transaction occurred, and in a manner that does not disclose the price of a ZEV credit in a specific transaction.

## Section 4
    a. For a ZEV credit sold to another manufacturer, the amount of the tax with respect to such sale is equal to the credit sales price reported under section 3 of this act multiplied by a rate of two percent.

    b. For a ZEV credit banked by a manufacturer, and thus considered sold under this chapter, the amount of tax with respect to the privilege of holding a banked ZEV credit for use in a future model year is equal to the average ZEV credit price calculated by the department under subsection (3) of this section, multiplied by the rate of 10 percent.

3. Based on the ZEV credit sales prices reported to the department under section 3 of this act:

    a. For each model year, the department must calculate the average ZEV credit price and share this information with the department of ecology for publication. The average ZEV credit price for a model year must be calculated by aggregating the reported sales prices of ZEV credits under section 3 of this act by all manufacturers that reported transactions for the model year.

    b. Beginning November 1, 2026, and each year thereafter, the department must calculate the amount of the tax by each manufacturer due under this section. The department must notify the manufacturer of their tax liability for the most recent reporting year no later than January 31st of the immediately following calendar year, except that the department may notify the manufacturer of their tax liability for both model year 2024 and model year 2025 no later than January 31, 2027.

    c. Once the average ZEV credit price has been calculated and is published to the department of ecology's website, the amount is considered final and cannot be altered based on amended information received by the department from the department of ecology or a participating manufacturer.

4. Penalties and interest under chapter 82.32 RCW will apply to any tax liability not paid by the due date of the notice of tax liability under subsection (3) of this section.
