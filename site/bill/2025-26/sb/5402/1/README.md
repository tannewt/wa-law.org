## Section 1
1. In addition to other eligibility requirements outlined in this chapter, students who demonstrate financial need are eligible to receive the Washington college grant.

2. Financial need is as follows:

    a. Students with family incomes between zero and 70 percent of the state median family income, adjusted for family size, shall receive the maximum Washington college grant as defined in RCW 28B.92.030; and

    b. Grants for students with incomes between 71 and 100 percent of the state median family income, adjusted for family size, shall be prorated at the following percentages of the maximum Washington college grant amount:

        i. 50 percent for students with family incomes between 71 and 80 percent of the state median family income;

        ii. 25 percent for students with family incomes between 81 and 90 percent of the state median family income

; and

        iii. 10 percent for students with family incomes between 91 and 100 percent of the state median family income.

## Section 2
1. As part of the Washington college grant program, all Washington college grant recipients who qualify for the maximum Washington college grant, but who are not recipients of the college bound scholarship program under chapter 28B.118 RCW are entitled to also receive an annual bridge grant of $500.

2. The office shall award bridge grants to eligible students beginning with the 2025-26 academic year.

3. To receive the full bridge grant for which the student qualifies, the student needs to be enrolled in an institution of higher education on at least a half-time basis. Students enrolled less than half-time must receive a prorated bridge grant.

4. The bridge grant must be applied to a student's financial aid package after all other gift aid has been awarded to the student.

5. As used in this section, "bridge grant" means an annual stipend provided in addition to the Washington college grant to provide supplementary financial support to low-income students to cover higher education expenses beyond tuition and fees, such as books, lab fees, supplies, technology, transportation, housing, and child care.
