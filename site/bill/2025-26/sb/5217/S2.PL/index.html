<li>
<p>The department shall investigate complaints and enforce this chapter. Prior to issuing any order under this subsection, the department must first contact the employer and attempt in good faith to reach agreement on reasonable accommodation or interim accommodation.

<p>[Empty]</p>

<p>A person who is 80 years of age or older may request to be excused from jury service if the person attests that the person is unable to serve due to health reasons.

</li>
<li>
<p>At the discretion of the court's designee, after a request by a prospective juror to be excused, a prospective juror excused from juror service for a particular time may be assigned to another jury term within the twelve-month period. If the assignment to another jury term is made at the time a juror is excused from the jury term for which he or she was summoned, a second summons under RCW 2.36.095 need not be issued. This subsection does not apply to people excused from jury service under subsection (2) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the jury source list has been fully summoned within a consecutive twelve-month period and additional jurors are needed, jurors who have already served during the consecutive twelve-month period may be summoned again for service. A juror who has previously served may only be excused if he or she served at least one week of juror service within the preceding twelve months. An excuse for prior service shall be granted only upon the written request of the prospective juror, which request shall certify the terms of prior service. Prior jury service may include service in superior court, in a court of limited jurisdiction, in the United States District Court, or on a jury of inquest.</p>
