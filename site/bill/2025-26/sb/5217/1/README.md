    a. "Employer" has the same meaning as and shall be interpreted consistent with how that term is defined in RCW 49.60.040, except that for the purposes of this section only , employer includes any employer who employs one or more persons and any religious or sectarian organization not organized for private profit.

    b. "Pregnancy" includes the employee's pregnancy and pregnancy-related health conditions, including the need to express breast milk.

    c. "Reasonable accommodation" means:

        i. Providing more frequent, longer, or flexible restroom breaks;

        ii. Modifying a no food or drink policy;

    b. Take adverse action against an employee who requests, declines, or uses an accommodation under this section that affects the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment;

    c. Deny employment opportunities to an otherwise qualified employee if such denial is based on the employer's need to make reasonable accommodation required by this section;

    d. Require an employee to take leave if another reasonable accommodation can be provided for the employee's pregnancy.

3. An employer may request that the employee provide written certification from her treating health care professional regarding the need for reasonable accommodation, except for accommodations listed in subsection (1)(c)(viii) and (d) of this section.

4. [Empty]

    a. This section does not require an employer to create additional employment that the employer would not otherwise have created, unless the employer does so or would do so for other classes of employees who need accommodation.

    b. This section does not require an employer to discharge any employee, transfer any employee with more seniority, or promote any employee who is not qualified to perform the job, unless the employer does so or would do so to accommodate other classes of employees who need accommodation.

## Section 2
1. Except for a person who is not qualified for jury service under RCW 2.36.070 or who chooses to opt out of jury service under subsection (2) of this section, no person may be excused from jury service by the court except upon a showing of undue hardship, extreme inconvenience, public necessity, or any reason deemed sufficient by the court for a period of time the court deems necessary.

2. [Empty]

    a. [Empty]

        i. A person who is 80 years of age or older may request to be excused from jury service if the person attests that the person is unable to serve due to health reasons.

        ii. A person who is breastfeeding may request to delay or be excused from jury service if the person attests that the person is unable to serve due to breastfeeding.

    b. An attestation form must be developed by the court and may not include a requirement that a doctor's note be provided. This request must be granted by the court.

3. At the discretion of the court's designee, after a request by a prospective juror to be excused, a prospective juror excused from juror service for a particular time may be assigned to another jury term within the twelve-month period. If the assignment to another jury term is made at the time a juror is excused from the jury term for which he or she was summoned, a second summons under RCW 2.36.095 need not be issued. This subsection does not apply to people excused from jury service under subsection (2) of this section.

4. When the jury source list has been fully summoned within a consecutive twelve-month period and additional jurors are needed, jurors who have already served during the consecutive twelve-month period may be summoned again for service. A juror who has previously served may only be excused if he or she served at least one week of juror service within the preceding twelve months. An excuse for prior service shall be granted only upon the written request of the prospective juror, which request shall certify the terms of prior service. Prior jury service may include service in superior court, in a court of limited jurisdiction, in the United States District Court, or on a jury of inquest.
