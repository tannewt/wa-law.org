[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6313.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that, as the Washington state capitol approaches its centennial in 2028, it remains a vital symbol of civic life and an architectural marvel featuring North America's tallest masonry dome. To honor this milestone, strategic public and private investments are essential to preserve its historic integrity while ensuring modern functionality. Funding will support improvements and enhancements that will enable more Washingtonians to access and enjoy this historic building. By supporting these efforts, public and private partners protect a shared heritage, ensuring this "People's House" continues to inspire and serve Washingtonians safely and effectively for another century of democracy and progress.
