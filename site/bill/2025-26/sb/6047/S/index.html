<p>Subject to the requirements in RCW 39.10.250, 39.10.270, or 39.10.280, public bodies may utilize the design-build procedure, including progressive design-build, for public works projects in which the total project cost is over $2,000,000 and where:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The construction activities are highly specialized and a design-build approach is critical in developing the construction methodology; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The projects selected provide opportunity for greater innovation or efficiencies between the designer and the builder; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Significant savings in project delivery time would be realized.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to the process in RCW 39.10.270 or 39.10.280, public bodies may use the design-build procedure, including progressive design-build, for parking garages and preengineered metal buildings, regardless of cost.</p>

<p>No expenditure may be incurred or obligation entered into for  major capital construction projects with a total anticipated cost in excess of $10,000,000 including, without exception, land acquisition, site development, predesign, design, construction, and equipment acquisition and installation, until the allotment of the funds to be expended has been approved by the office of financial management. This limitation does not prohibit the continuation of expenditures and obligations into the succeeding biennium for projects for which allotments have been approved in the immediate prior biennium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If at any time during the fiscal period the governor projects a cash deficit in a particular fund or account as defined by RCW 43.88.050, the governor shall make across-the-board reductions in allotments for that particular fund or account so as to prevent a cash deficit, unless the legislature has directed the liquidation of the cash deficit over one or more fiscal periods. Except for the legislative and judicial branches and other agencies headed by elective officials, the governor shall review the statement of proposed operating expenditures for reasonableness and conformance with legislative intent. The governor may request corrections of proposed allotments submitted by the legislative and judicial branches and agencies headed by elective officials if those proposed allotments contain significant technical errors. Once the governor approves the proposed allotments, further revisions may at the request of the office of financial management or upon the agency's initiative be made on a quarterly basis and must be accompanied by an explanation of the reasons for significant changes. However, changes in appropriation level authorized by the legislature, changes required by across-the-board reductions mandated by the governor, changes caused by executive increases to spending authority, and changes caused by executive decreases to spending authority for failure to comply with the provisions of chapter 36.70A RCW may require additional revisions. Revisions shall not be made retroactively. However, the governor may assign to a reserve status any portion of an agency appropriation withheld as part of across-the-board reductions made by the governor and any portion of an agency appropriation conditioned on a contingent event by the appropriations act. The governor may remove these amounts from reserve status if the across-the-board reductions are subsequently modified or if the contingent event occurs. The director of financial management shall enter approved statements of proposed expenditures into the state budgeting, accounting, and reporting system within forty-five days after receipt of the proposed statements from the agencies. If an agency or the director of financial management is unable to meet these requirements, the director of financial management shall provide a timely explanation in writing to the legislative fiscal committees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is expressly provided that all agencies shall be required to maintain accounting records and to report thereon in the manner prescribed in this chapter and under the regulations issued pursuant to this chapter. Within ninety days of the end of the fiscal year, all agencies shall submit to the director of financial management their final adjustments to close their books for the fiscal year. Prior to submitting fiscal data, written or oral, to committees of the legislature, it is the responsibility of the agency submitting the data to reconcile it with the budget and accounting data reported by the agency to the director of financial management.</p>

<p>Prior to approval, the office of financial management shall provide a copy of the predesign to the fiscal committees of the legislature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of financial management may make an exception to some or all of the predesign requirements.

</li>
<li>
<p>Whether, within six years of submitting the request for funding, the agency has completed, or initiated the construction of, a substantially similar project;</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the requesting agency indicates that the project may not require some or all of the requirements in subsection (1) of this section due to a lack of complexity; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether any other factors related to project complexity or risk, as determined by the office of financial management, could reduce the need for, or scope of, a predesign.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The office of financial managementmay authorize a transfer of the appropriation authority for a capital project that is in excess of the amount required for the completion of the project to another capital project for which the appropriation is insufficient.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>No such transfer may be used to expand the capacity or change the intended use of the project beyond that intended by the legislature in making the appropriation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The transfer may be effected only between capital projects within a specific department, commission, agency, or institution of higher education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The transfer may be effected only if the project from which the transfer of funds is made is substantially complete and there are funds remaining, or bids have been let on the project from which the transfer of funds is made and it appears to a substantial certainty that the project can be completed within the biennium for less than the amount appropriated.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, the legislature intends that each project be defined as proposed to the legislature in the governor's budget document, unless the legislative history demonstrates that the legislature intended to define the scope of a project in a different way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of financial management shall notify the legislative fiscal committees of the senate and the house of representatives at least thirty days before any transfer is effected under this section except emergency projects or any transfer under two hundred fifty thousand dollars, and shall prepare a report to such committees listing all completed transfers at the close of each fiscal year.</p>

<h2 id="section-9">Section 9 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section sets forth the major fiscal duties and responsibilities of officers and agencies of the executive branch. The regulations issued by the governor pursuant to this chapter shall provide for a comprehensive, orderly basis for fiscal management and control, including efficient accounting and reporting therefor, for the executive branch of the state government and may include, in addition, such requirements as will generally promote more efficient public management in the state.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Governor; director of financial management. The governor, through the director of financial management, shall devise and supervise a modern and complete accounting system for each agency to the end that all revenues, expenditures, receipts, disbursements, resources, and obligations of the state shall be properly and systematically accounted for. The accounting system shall include the development of accurate, timely records and reports of all financial affairs of the state. The system shall also provide for central accounts in the office of financial management at the level of detail deemed necessary by the director to perform central financial management. The director of financial management shall adopt and periodically update an accounting procedures manual. Any agency maintaining its own accounting and reporting system shall comply with the updated accounting procedures manual and the rules of the director adopted under this chapter. An agency may receive a waiver from complying with this requirement if the waiver is approved by the director. Waivers expire at the end of the fiscal biennium for which they are granted. The director shall forward notice of waivers granted to the appropriate legislative fiscal committees. The director of financial management may require such financial, statistical, and other reports as the director deems necessary from all agencies covering any period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in chapter 43.88C RCW, the director of financial management is responsible for quarterly reporting of primary operating budget drivers such as applicable workloads, caseload estimates, and appropriate unit cost data. These reports shall be transmitted to the legislative fiscal committees or by electronic means to the legislative evaluation and accountability program committee. Quarterly reports shall include actual monthly data and the variance between actual and estimated data to date. The reports shall also include estimates of these items for the remainder of the budget period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director of financial management shall submit progress reports at least twice a year to the appropriate legislative committees regarding the status of all appropriated capital projects with a total anticipated cost in excess of $10,000,000, including transportation projects, and showing any significant cost overruns or underruns. If funds are shifted from one project to another, the office of financial management shall also reflect this in the  report. Once a project is complete, the report shall provide a final summary showing estimated start and completion dates of each project phase compared to actual dates, estimated costs of each project phase compared to actual costs, and whether or not there are any outstanding liabilities or unsettled claims at the time of completion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, the director of financial management, as agent of the governor, shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Develop and maintain a system of internal controls and internal audits comprising methods and procedures to be adopted by each agency that will safeguard its assets, check the accuracy and reliability of its accounting data, promote operational efficiency, and encourage adherence to prescribed managerial policies for accounting and financial controls. The system developed by the director shall include criteria for determining the scope and comprehensiveness of internal controls required by classes of agencies, depending on the level of resources at risk.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>For those agencies that the director determines internal audit is required, the agency head or authorized designee shall be assigned the responsibility and authority for establishing and maintaining internal audits following professional audit standards including generally accepted government auditing standards or standards adopted by the institute of internal auditors, or both.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For those agencies that the director determines internal audit is not required, the agency head or authorized designee may establish and maintain internal audits following professional audit standards including generally accepted government auditing standards or standards adopted by the institute of internal auditors, or both, but at a minimum must comply with policies as established by the director to assess the effectiveness of the agency's systems of internal controls and risk management processes;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make surveys and analyses of agencies with the object of determining better methods and increased effectiveness in the use of manpower and materials; and the director shall authorize expenditures for employee training to the end that the state may benefit from training facilities made available to state employees;</p>

<p>Establish policies for allowing the contracting of child care services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Report to the governor with regard to duplication of effort or lack of coordination among agencies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review any pay and classification plans, and changes thereunder, developed by any agency for their fiscal impact: PROVIDED, That none of the provisions of this subsection shall affect merit systems of personnel management now existing or hereafter established by statute relating to the fixing of qualifications requirements for recruitment, appointment, or promotion of employees of any agency. The director shall advise and confer with agencies including appropriate standing committees of the legislature as may be designated by the speaker of the house and the president of the senate regarding the fiscal impact of such plans and may amend or alter the plans, except that for the following agencies no amendment or alteration of the plans may be made without the approval of the agency concerned: Agencies headed by elective officials;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix the number and classes of positions or authorized employee years of employment for each agency and during the fiscal period amend the determinations previously fixed by the director except that the director shall not be empowered to fix the number or the classes for the following: Agencies headed by elective officials;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adopt rules to effectuate provisions contained in (a) through (f) of this subsection.</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It shall be unlawful for the treasurer to disburse public funds in the treasury except upon forms or by alternative means duly prescribed by the director of financial management. These forms or alternative means shall provide for authentication and certification by the agency head or the agency head's designee that the services have been rendered or the materials have been furnished; or, in the case of loans or grants, that the loans or grants are authorized by law; or, in the case of payments for periodic maintenance services to be performed on state owned equipment, that a written contract for such periodic maintenance services is currently in effect; and the treasurer shall not be liable under the treasurer's surety bond for erroneous or improper payments so made. When services are lawfully paid for in advance of full performance by any private individual or business entity other than equipment maintenance providers or as provided for by RCW 42.24.035, such individual or entity other than central stores rendering such services shall make a cash deposit or furnish surety bond coverage to the state as shall be fixed in an amount by law, or if not fixed by law, then in such amounts as shall be fixed by the director of the department of enterprise services but in no case shall such required cash deposit or surety bond be less than an amount which will fully indemnify the state against any and all losses on account of breach of promise to fully perform such services. No payments shall be made in advance for any equipment maintenance services to be performed more than twelve months after such payment except that institutions of higher education as defined in RCW 28B.10.016 and Washington technology solutions created in RCW 43.105.006 may make payments in advance for equipment maintenance services to be performed up to sixty months after such payment. Any such bond so furnished shall be conditioned that the person, firm or corporation receiving the advance payment will apply it toward performance of the contract. The responsibility for recovery of erroneous or improper payments made under this section shall lie with the agency head or the agency head's designee in accordance with rules issued pursuant to this chapter. Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit a public body to advance funds to a private service provider pursuant to a grant or loan before services have been rendered or material furnished.</p>

The auditor may make such a report to a legislative committee only if the auditor has determined that the agency has been given an opportunity and has failed to resolve the management or performance issues raised by the auditor. If the auditor makes a report to a legislative committee, the agency may submit to the committee a response to the report.
