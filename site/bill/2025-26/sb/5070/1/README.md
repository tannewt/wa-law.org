# SB 5070 - Interchange fees on tips

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5070.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that the use of credit or debit cards can prevent an employee from receiving the full amount of their earned tips and gratuities. Currently some employers deduct a proportional amount of any fees the employer is assessed on a credit or debit card transaction from an employee's tip.

2. The legislature also finds that credit or debit card usage in commercial transactions places an undue financial burden on merchants required to collect taxes on behalf of the state of Washington when the merchant must pay fees assessed on the taxed amount.

3. Therefore, the legislature intends to bring greater transparency, clarity, and accountability to certain acts of commerce. Prohibiting all interchange fees on tips and gratuities will ensure employees receive their full earned tips and gratuities. Prohibiting all interchange fees on taxes merchants collect on behalf of the state will reduce the financial burden merchants bear on behalf of the state.

## Section 2

## Section 3
1. An issuer, a payment card network, an acquirer bank, or a processor may not receive or charge a merchant any interchange fee on the tax or gratuity amount of an electronic payment transaction if the merchant informs the acquirer bank or its designee of the tax or gratuity amount as part of the authorization or settlement process for the electronic payment transaction. The merchant must transmit the tax or gratuity amount data as part of the authorization or settlement process to avoid being charged interchange fees on the tax or gratuity amount of an electronic payment transaction.

5. Payment card networks shall, within two years of the effective date of this section, provide a mechanism for merchants to transmit tax or gratuity amount data as part of the electronic payment transaction process sufficient to allow acquirer banks to exclude those amounts from any interchange fee assessment.
