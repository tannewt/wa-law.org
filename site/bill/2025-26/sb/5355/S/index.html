<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes that policies concerning sex-based violence and harassment have evolved into a survivor-focused, victim-centered approach on a state level. While college campuses have been working in this area, this approach has not been fully realized yet, and sex-based violence and harassment remain a major barrier for students working to achieve their educational goals.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that, according to the rape, abuse, and incest national network, postsecondary students are at high risk for sex-based violence and harassment; among undergraduate and graduate students, 13 percent experience sexual assault or rape during their postsecondary schooling years. Undergraduate women in particular experience even higher rates, with more than one in four experiencing sexual assault or rape.</p>
<p>The legislature acknowledges that postsecondary students lack adequate protections against sex-based violence and harassment as well as avenues for justice, and that survivors need access to more relevant, timely, and sensitive resources. Although the state has invested in student safety on campus, the ongoing rates of sex-based violence and harassment demand the legislature's action and attention to protect students and ensure they are able to successfully achieve their potential.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to provide survivors at postsecondary institutions with certain protections, resources, and accommodations to help them navigate the aftermath of traumatic sex-based and gender-based violence and harassment.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In addition to all other rights provided in law, a student at an institution of higher education in Washington who is a survivor of sex-based violence and harassment has the right to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Engage with employees who have been trained in trauma-informed care. Institutions of higher education must clearly list on their website the campus-based employee roles trained in trauma-informed care that are responsible for responding to survivor disclosures as part of their job duties. Title IX employees at each institution of higher education who may interact with a survivor of sex-based violence and harassment must receive at least three hours of training on relationship violence, abuse dynamics, impacts of trauma on the body, and other forms of violence. The institution of higher education must provide the training in accordance with section 4 of this act;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A quick and timely institutional investigation process not to exceed six months from the date an investigation is initiated, unless extenuating circumstances exist. The student must be kept informed on the status of the investigation throughout the entirety of the process;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mental health or counseling services, on campus or off-site, regardless of whether the student chooses to make a formal report through the campus Title IX office or to law enforcement. The institution of higher education must make a good faith effort to ensure students have access to a mental health provider either in person or electronically via telehealth;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request supportive measures. Supportive measures must be nondisciplinary, nonpunitive individualized services and must be offered as appropriate, as reasonably available, and without fee or charge, regardless of whether a formal complaint has been filed. Supportive measures must aim to restore or preserve a student's access to the institution of higher education's programs and activities without unreasonably burdening the other party, and to provide support during the institution of higher education's informal resolution or formal complaint processes, as determined through an interactive process between the campus Title IX office, the student, and relevant employees, such as faculty when an academic adjustment is requested. No information about the survivor's experience may be shared in the course of facilitating supportive measures with relevant employees or other third parties, unless specifically requested by the survivor. Supportive measures may include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Counseling and other medical assistance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extensions of deadlines or other academic adjustments;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modifications of on-campus work or class schedules;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leaves of absence;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased security or monitoring of certain areas of campus; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="i" start="6">
<li>Directives prohibiting the parties from contacting one another in housing or work situations;</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a" start="5">
<li>
<p>Have court-issued no-contact and restraining orders honored and reported to university police and security services by a trained employee, such as a campus-affiliated advocate when requested to do so by the survivor;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be made aware by a campus-based employee if the employee is a Title IX required reporter and to which office the employee will share the information provided by the survivor; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to a no-fee attorney through an organization that serves the entire state and is focused on sexual assault.</p>
</li>
</ol>
