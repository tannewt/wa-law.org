# SB 5355 - Higher education safety

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5355.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature recognizes that policies concerning sex-based violence and harassment have evolved into a survivor-focused, victim-centered approach on a state level. While college campuses have been working in this area, this approach has not been fully realized yet, and sex-based violence and harassment remain a major barrier for students working to achieve their educational goals.

The legislature finds that, according to the rape, abuse, and incest national network, postsecondary students are at high risk for sex-based violence and harassment; among undergraduate and graduate students, 13 percent experience sexual assault or rape during their postsecondary schooling years. Undergraduate women in particular experience even higher rates, with more than one in four experiencing sexual assault or rape.

The legislature acknowledges that postsecondary students lack adequate protections against sex-based violence and harassment as well as avenues for justice, and that survivors need access to more relevant, timely, and sensitive resources. Although the state has invested in student safety on campus, the ongoing rates of sex-based violence and harassment demand the legislature's action and attention to protect students and ensure they are able to successfully achieve their potential.

Therefore, the legislature intends to provide survivors at postsecondary institutions with certain protections, resources, and accommodations to help them navigate the aftermath of traumatic sex-based and gender-based violence and harassment.

## Section 2
1. In addition to all other rights provided in law, a student at an institution of higher education in Washington who is a survivor of sex-based violence and harassment has the right to:

    a. Engage with employees who have been trained in trauma-informed care. Institutions of higher education must clearly list on their website the campus-based employees trained in trauma-informed care. The employees are responsible for responding to survivor disclosures. Title IX employees at each institution of higher education who may interact with a survivor of sex-based violence and harassment must receive at least three hours of training on relationship violence, abuse dynamics, impacts of trauma on the body, and other forms of violence. The institution of higher education must provide the training in accordance with section 4 of this act;

    b. A quick and timely institutional investigation process not to exceed six months from the date an investigation is initiated, unless extenuating circumstances exist. Students must be kept informed on the status of the investigation throughout the entirety of the process;

    c. Mental health or counseling services, on campus or off-site, regardless of whether the student chooses to make a formal report through the campus Title IX office or to law enforcement. The institution of higher education must make a good faith effort to ensure students have access to no less than eight visits with the same mental health provider either in person or electronically via telehealth;

    d. Access to confidential support services, which may include peer advocates, campus-affiliated advocates, and gender-based violence support groups. Beginning with the 2027-28 academic year, institutions of higher education must hire and train campus-affiliated advocates. A campus-affiliated advocate trained in trauma-informed care, consistent with the current standards for initial and continuing education training of domestic violence program staff, must be available within two business days of a report being made to the Title IX office or campus-based advocacy office. Survivors must have the option to be accompanied by a campus-affiliated advocate or peer advocate trained in trauma-informed care, while engaged in seeking support services or reporting concerns to an institution of higher education related to sex-based or gender-based violence and harassment. Peer advocates must be trained in trauma-informed care consistent with current standards for initial and continuing education training of domestic violence program staff. Campus-affiliated advocates may include personnel from the institution or from a partnership with a community-based victim's advocacy organization;

    e. Request supportive measures. Supportive measures must be nondisciplinary, nonpunitive individualized services and must be offered as appropriate, as reasonably available, and without fee or charge, regardless of whether a formal complaint has been filed. Supportive measures must aim to restore or preserve a student's access to the institution of higher education's programs and activities without unreasonably burdening the other party, and to provide support during the institution of higher education's informal resolution or formal complaint processes, as determined through an interactive process between the campus Title IX office, the student, and relevant employees, such as faculty when an academic adjustment is requested. No information about the survivor's experience may be shared in the course of facilitating supportive measures with relevant employees or other third parties, unless specifically requested by the survivor. Supportive measures may include, but are not limited to:

        i. Counseling and other medical assistance;

        ii. Extensions of deadlines or other academic adjustments;

        iii. Modifications of on-campus work or class schedules;

        iv. Leaves of absence;

    v. Increased security or monitoring of certain areas of campus; and

    vi. Directives prohibiting the parties from contacting one another in housing or work situations;

    f. Have court-issued no-contact and restraining orders honored and reported to university police and security services by a trained employee, such as a campus-affiliated advocate when requested to do so by the survivor;

    g. Be made aware by a campus-based employee if the employee is a Title IX required reporter and to which office the employee will share the information provided by the survivor; and

    h. Access to a no-fee attorney through an organization that serves the entire state and is focused on sexual assault.

2. For purposes of this section, "institutions of higher education" include (a) the state universities, the regional universities, and the state college as defined in RCW 28B.10.016, and (b) all community and technical colleges that serve 8,000 or more students.

The committee shall evaluate barriers that impact survivors of sex-based and gender-based violence and harassment and their ability to access services and obtain supportive measures at institutions of higher education, and will collaborate with outside organizations and entities focused on survivors of sex-based and gender-based violence and harassment.

2. The student health and safety committee shall:

    a. Evaluate existing supportive measures and make recommendations on how to facilitate existing processes to better serve survivors in requesting supportive measures;

    b. Form relationships with local victims' advocacy organizations; and

    c. Assess various institutional staffing models of campus-affiliated advocates and make recommendations.

3. The student health and safety committee shall annually report its recommendations developed under subsection (2) of this section to the appropriate committees of the legislature in accordance with RCW 43.01.036.

4. Beginning with the 2026-27 academic year, the state college, the state universities, and the regional universities as defined in RCW 28B.10.016 that serve 8,000 or more students shall work with the student health and safety committee to develop questions for student feedback on relevant issues on sex-based and gender-based violence and harassment and students' ability to access services for the campus climate assessment required in RCW 28B.10.147.
