# SB 6160 - Reports by state agencies

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6160.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that requiring state agencies to report to the legislature is an important method of providing information and keeping the legislature informed on the implementation and impacts of legislation. Some reports provide information that is no longer relevant or useful to the legislature, which can be discerned by the lack of interest in the report. There are other reports that are redundant as the information is provided through other means. In addition, preparing reports is time consuming, and there may be better, more efficient mechanisms for sharing information with legislators as well as the public, such as posting the information on agency websites. Finally, some reports are required on a more frequent basis than is necessary, as the information does not change to an extent that merits the increased frequency.

2. In order to improve agency efficiency and still ensure that information is publicly available and provided to the legislature as needed, it is the legislature's intent to eliminate reports that no longer serve a relevant purpose, change reporting frequency where warranted, and provide alternative mechanisms in place of submitting reports where appropriate.

## Section 101

## Section 207
The legislature recognizes the importance of providing the greatest diversity of habitats, particularly riparian, wetland, and old growth habitats, and of assuring the greatest diversity of species within those habitats for the survival and reproduction of enough individuals to maintain the native wildlife of Washington forestlands. The legislature also recognizes the importance of long-term habitat productivity for natural and wild fish, for the protection of hatchery water supplies, and for the protection of water quality and quantity to meet the needs of people, fish, and wildlife. The legislature recognizes the importance of maintaining and enhancing fish and wildlife habitats capable of sustaining the commercial and noncommercial uses of fish and wildlife. The legislature further recognizes the importance of the continued growth and development of the state's forest products industry which has a vital stake in the long-term productivity of both the public and private forestland base.

The development of a landscape planning system would help achieve these goals. Landowners and resource managers should be provided incentives to voluntarily develop long-term multispecies landscape management plans that will provide protection to public resources. Because landscape planning represents a departure from the use of standard baseline rules and may result in unintended consequences to both the affected habitats and to a landowner's economic interests, the legislature desires to establish up to seven experimental pilot programs to gain experience with landscape planning that may prove useful in fashioning legislation of a more general application.

1. Until December 31, 2000, the department in cooperation with the department of fish and wildlife, and the department of ecology when relating to water quality protection, is granted authority to select not more than seven pilot projects for the purpose of developing individual landowner multispecies landscape management plans.

    a. Pilot project participants must be selected by the department in cooperation with the department of fish and wildlife, and the department of ecology when relating to water quality protection, no later than October 1, 1997.

    b. The number and the location of the pilot projects are to be determined by the department in cooperation with the department of fish and wildlife, and the department of ecology when relating to water quality protection, and should be selected on the basis of risk to the habitat and species, variety and importance of species and habitats in the planning area, geographic distribution, surrounding ownership, other ongoing landscape and watershed planning activities in the area, potential benefits to water quantity and quality, financial and staffing capabilities of participants, and other factors that will contribute to the creation of landowner multispecies landscape planning efforts.

    c. Each pilot project shall have a landscape management plan with the following elements:

        i. An identification of public resources selected for coverage under the plan and measurable objectives for the protection of the selected public resources;

        ii. A termination date of not later than 2050;

        iii. A general description of the planning area including its geographic location, physical and biological features, habitats, and species known to be present;

        iv. An identification of the existing forest practices rules that will not apply during the term of the plan;

    v. Proposed habitat management strategies or prescriptions;

    vi. A projection of the habitat conditions likely to result from the implementation of the specified management strategies or prescriptions;

    vii. An assessment of habitat requirements and the current habitat conditions of representative species included in the plan;

    viii. An assessment of potential or likely impacts to representative species resulting from the prescribed forest practices;

        ix. A description of the anticipated benefits to those species or other species as a result of plan implementation;

    x. A monitoring plan;

    xi. Reporting requirements including a schedule for review of the plan's performance in meeting its objectives;

    xii. Conditions under which a plan may be modified, including a procedure for adaptive management;

    xiii. Conditions under which a plan may be terminated;

    xiv. A procedure for adaptive management that evaluates the effectiveness of the plan to meet its measurable public resources objectives, reflects changes in the best available science, and provides changes to its habitat management strategies, prescriptions, and hydraulic project standards to the extent agreed to in the plan and in a timely manner and schedule;

    xv. A description of how the plan relates to publicly available plans of adjacent federal, state, tribal, and private timberland owners; and

    xvi. A statement of whether the landowner intends to apply for approval of the plan under applicable federal law.

2. Until December 31, 2000, the department, in agreement with the department of fish and wildlife, and the department of ecology when the landowner elects to cover water quality in the plan, shall approve a landscape management plan and enter into a binding implementation agreement with the landowner when such departments find, based upon the best scientific data available, that:

    a. The plan contains all of the elements required under this section including measurable public resource objectives;

    b. The plan is expected to be effective in meeting those objectives;

    c. The landowner has sufficient financial resources to implement the management strategies or prescriptions to be implemented by the landowner under the plan;

    d. The plan will:

        i. Provide better protection than current state law for the public resources selected for coverage under the plan considered in the aggregate; and

        ii. Compared to conditions that could result from compliance with current state law:

(A) Not result in poorer habitat conditions over the life of the plan for any species selected for coverage that is listed as threatened or endangered under federal or state law, or that has been identified as a candidate for such listing, at the time the plan is approved; and

(B) Measurably improve habitat conditions for species selected for special consideration under the plan;

    e. The plan shall include watershed analysis or provide for a level of protection that meets or exceeds the protection that would be provided by watershed analysis, if the landowner selects fish or water quality as a public resource to be covered under the plan. Any alternative process to watershed analysis would be subject to timely peer review;

    f. The planning process provides for a public participation process during the development of the plan, which shall be developed by the department in cooperation with the landowner.

The management plans must be submitted to the department and the department of fish and wildlife, and the department of ecology when the landowner elects to cover water quality in the plan, no later than March 1, 2000. The department shall provide an opportunity for public comment on the proposed plan. The comment period shall not be less than forty-five days. The department shall approve or reject plans within one hundred twenty days of submittal by the landowner of a final plan. The decision by the department, in agreement with the department of fish and wildlife, and the department of ecology when the landowner has elected to cover water quality in the plan, to approve or disapprove the management plan is subject to the environmental review process of chapter 43.21C RCW, provided that any public comment period provided for under chapter 43.21C RCW shall run concurrently with the public comment period provided in this subsection (2).

3. After a landscape management plan is adopted:

    a. Forest practices consistent with the plan need not comply with:

        i. The specific forest practices rules identified in the plan; and

        ii. Any forest practice rules and policies adopted after the approval of the plan to the extent that the rules:

(A) Have been adopted primarily for the protection of a public resource selected for coverage under the plan; or

(B) Provide for procedural or administrative obligations inconsistent with or in addition to those provided for in the plan with respect to those public resources; and

    b. If the landowner has selected fish as one of the public resources to be covered under the plan, the plan shall serve as the hydraulic project approval for the life of the plan, in compliance with RCW 77.55.021.

4. The department is authorized to issue a single landscape level permit valid for the life of the plan to a landowner who has an approved landscape management plan and who has requested a landscape permit from the department. Landowners receiving a landscape level permit shall meet annually with the department and the department of fish and wildlife, and the department of ecology where water quality has been selected as a public resource to be covered under the plan, to review the specific forest practices activities planned for the next twelve months and to determine whether such activities are in compliance with the plan. The departments will consult with the affected Indian tribes and other interested parties who have expressed an interest in connection with the review. The landowner is to provide ten calendar days' notice to the department prior to the commencement of any forest practices authorized under a landscape level permit. The landscape level permit will not impose additional conditions relating to the public resources selected for coverage under the plan beyond those agreed to in the plan. For the purposes of chapter 43.21C RCW, forest practices conducted in compliance with an approved plan are deemed not to have the potential for a substantial impact on the environment as to any public resource selected for coverage under the plan.

5. Except as otherwise provided in a plan, the agreement implementing the landscape management plan is an agreement that runs with the property covered by the approved landscape management plan and the department shall record notice of the plan in the real property records of the counties in which the affected properties are located. Prior to its termination, no plan shall permit forestland covered by its terms to be withdrawn from such coverage, whether by sale, exchange, or other means, nor to be converted to nonforestry uses except to the extent that such withdrawal or conversion would not measurably impair the achievement of the plan's stated public resource objectives. If a participant transfers all or part of its interest in the property, the terms of the plan still apply to the new landowner for the plan's stated duration unless the plan is terminated under its terms or unless the plan specifies the conditions under which the terms of the plan do not apply to the new landowner.

6. The departments of natural resources, fish and wildlife, and ecology shall seek to develop memorandums of agreements with federal agencies and affected Indian tribes relating to tribal issues in the landscape management plans. The departments shall solicit input from affected Indian tribes in connection with the selection, review, and approval of any landscape management plan. If any recommendation is received from an affected Indian tribe and is not adopted by the departments, the departments shall provide a written explanation of their reasons for not adopting the recommendation.

## Section 208
The department together with the department of fish and wildlife, and the department of ecology relating to water quality protection, shall develop a suitable process to permit landowners to secure all permits required for the conduct of forest practices in a single multiyear permit to be jointly issued by the departments .

## Section 209
1. The legislature intends that small forestland owners have access to alternate plan processes or alternate harvest restrictions, or both if necessary, that meet the public resource protection standard set forth in RCW 76.09.370(3), but which also lowers the overall cost of regulation to small forestland owners including, but not limited to, timber value forgone, layout costs, and operating costs. The forest practices board shall consult with the small forestland owner office advisory committee in developing these alternate approaches.

2. As used in this section, "small forestland owner" has the same meaning as defined in RCW 76.13.120(2).

## Section 210
1. The board must amend the forest practices rules relating to road maintenance and abandonment plans that exist on May 14, 2003, to reflect the following:

    a. A forestland owner who owns a total of eighty acres or less of forestland in Washington is not required to submit a road maintenance and abandonment plan for any block of forestland that is twenty contiguous acres or less in area;

    b. A landowner who satisfies the definition of a small forestland owner, but who does not qualify under (a) of this subsection, is only required to submit a checklist road maintenance and abandonment plan with the abbreviated content requirements provided for in subsection (3) of this section, and is not required to comply with annual reporting and review requirements; and

    c. Existing forest roads must be maintained only to the extent necessary to prevent damage to public resources.

2. The department must provide a landowner who is either exempted from submitting a road maintenance and abandonment plan under subsection (1)(a) of this section, or who qualifies for a checklist road maintenance and abandonment plan under subsection (1)(b) of this section, with an educational brochure outlining road maintenance standards and requirements. In addition, the department must develop a series of nonmandatory educational workshops on the rules associated with road construction and maintenance.

3. [Empty]

    a. A landowner who qualifies for a checklist road maintenance and abandonment plan under subsection (1)(b) of this section is only required to submit a checklist, designed by the department in consultation with the small forestland owner office advisory committee created in RCW 76.13.110, that confirms that the landowner is applying the checklist criteria to forest roads covered or affected by a forest practices application or notification. When developing the checklist road maintenance and abandonment plan, the department shall ensure that the checklist does not exceed current state law. Nothing in this subsection increases or adds to small forestland owners' duties or responsibilities under any other section of the forest practices rules or any other state law or rule.

    b. A landowner who qualifies for the checklist road maintenance and abandonment plan is not required to submit the checklist before the time that he or she submits a forest practices application or notification for final or intermediate harvesting, or for salvage of trees. The department may encourage and accept checklists prior to the time that they are due.

4.

The board shall adopt emergency rules under RCW 34.05.090 by October 31, 2003, to implement this section. The emergency rules shall remain in effect until permanent rules can be adopted. The forest practices rules that relate to road maintenance and abandonment plans shall remain in effect as they existed on May 14, 2003, until emergency rules have been adopted under this section.

5. This section is only intended to relate to the board's duties as they relate to the road maintenance and abandonment plan element of the forests and fish report. Nothing in this section alters any forestland owner's duties and responsibilities under any other section of the forest practices rules, or any other state law or rule.

## Section 211
1. Until July 1, 2030, the charge for the term of an easement granted under RCW 79.110.230(2) will be determined as follows and will be paid in advance upon grant of the easement:

    a. Five thousand dollars for individual easement crossings that are no longer than one mile in length;

    b. Twelve thousand five hundred dollars for individual easement crossings that are more than one mile but less than five miles in length; or

    c. Twenty thousand dollars for individual easement crossings that are five miles or more in length.

2. The charge for easements under subsection (1) of this section must be adjusted annually by the rate of yearly change in the most recently published Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton consumer price index, all urban consumers (CPI-U), over the consumer price index for the same period of the preceding year, as compiled by the bureau of labor statistics, United States department of labor for the state of Washington rounded up to the nearest fifty dollars.

3. The term of the easement is thirty years or a period of less than thirty years if requested by the person or entity seeking the easement.

4. In addition to the charge for the easement under subsection (1) of this section, the department may recover its administrative costs incurred in receiving an application for the easement, approving the easement, and reviewing plans for and construction of the public utility lines. For the purposes of this subsection, "administrative costs" is equivalent to twenty percent of the fee for the easement as determined under subsection (1) of this section and adjusted under subsection (2) of this section. For public utility lines owned by a governmental entity, the administrative costs will be calculated based on the length of the easement and the fee that it would be charged if it were subject to the easement charges in this section. When multiple public utility lines are owned by the same entity and are authorized under the same easement, the administrative fee for the easement shall be equal to twenty percent of the easement fee for the single longest public utility line. Administrative costs recovered by the department must be deposited into the resource management cost account.

5. Applicants under RCW 79.110.230(2) providing a residence with an individual service connection for electrical, natural gas, cable television, or telecommunications service are not required to pay the charge for the easement under subsection (1) of this section but shall pay administrative costs under subsection (4) of this section.

6. A final decision on applications for an easement must be made within one hundred twenty days after the department receives the completed application and after all applicable regulatory permits for the aquatic easement have been acquired. This subsection applies to applications submitted before June 13, 2002, as well as to applications submitted on or after June 13, 2002. Upon request of the applicant, the department may reach a decision on an application within sixty days and charge an additional fee for an expedited processing. The fee for an expedited processing is ten percent of the combined total of the easement charge and administrative costs.

Interstate 405 and state route number 167 are designated an eligible toll facility, and toll revenue generated in the corridor must only be expended on the Interstate 405 and state route number 167 projects as identified in each corridor's master plan and as allowed under RCW 47.56.820.

2. Tolls for the express toll lanes must be set as follows:

    a. The schedule of toll rates must be set by the tolling authority pursuant to RCW 47.56.850. Toll rates may vary in amount by time of day, level of traffic congestion within the highway facility, or other criteria, as the tolling authority deems appropriate.

    b. In those locations with two express toll lanes in each direction, the toll rate must be the same in both lanes.

    c. Toll charges may not be assessed on transit buses and vanpools.

    d. The department shall establish performance standards for travel time, speed, and reliability for the express toll lanes project. The department must automatically adjust the toll rate within the schedule established by the tolling authority, using dynamic tolling, to maintain the goal that average vehicle speeds in the lanes remain above forty-five miles per hour at least ninety percent of the time during peak hours.

    e. The tolling authority shall periodically review the toll rates against traffic performance of all lanes to determine if the toll rates are effectively maintaining travel time, speed, and reliability on the highway facilities.

    f. [Empty]

        i.
