        ii. Subsequent subdivision actions, additions, or modifications to the unit lot housing development project's structures may not create or increase any nonconformity of the parent lot as a whole, and shall conform to the approved unit lot housing development project or to the land use and development standards in effect at the time of the proposed actions, additions, or modifications;

        iii. If a structure or portion of a structure within the unit lot housing development project has been damaged or destroyed, any repair, reconstruction, or replacement of any structure shall conform to the approved unit lot housing development project or to the land use and development standards in effect at the time the proposed repair, reconstruction, or replacement project's permit application becomes vested; and

    c. After the deadlines in (e) of this subsection, no city or town subject to this section may decline to accept, process, or approve an application for a unit lot subdivision, consistent with the procedural requirements of (a) and (b) of this subsection, solely because that city or town has not completed adoption or enactment of the procedures required under this section.

    d. Nothing in this section:

        i. Prohibits a city or county from applying public health, safety, building code, and environmental permitting requirements to a development project that is subject to or integrated with a unit lot subdivision process;

        ii.

    e. Cities and towns that are required to submit their next comprehensive plan update in 2027 pursuant to RCW 36.70A.130 must adopt or amend by ordinance, and incorporate into their development regulations, zoning regulations, and other official controls, the requirements of this section in their next comprehensive plan update.

When the vacation application is specifically for a county road or city or town street, the procedures for road vacation or street vacation in chapter 36.87 or 35.79 RCW shall be utilized for the road or street vacation. When the application is for the vacation of the plat together with the roads and/or streets, the procedure for vacation in this section shall be used, but vacations of streets may not be made that are prohibited under RCW 35.79.035, and vacations of roads may not be made that are prohibited under RCW 36.87.130.

Whenever a city, town, or county receives an application for the approval of a plat for a subdivision that lies in whole or in part in an irrigation district organized pursuant to chapter 87.03 RCW, the administrative personnel shall give written notice of the application, including a legal description of the  subdivision and a location map, to the irrigation district. The irrigation district shall, after receiving the notice, submit to the administrative personnel who furnished the notice a statement with any information or conditions for approval that the irrigation district deems to be necessary regarding the proposed subdivision's effect upon the structural integrity, including lateral support, of the irrigation district facilities, other risk exposures, and the safety of the public and irrigation district.

2. In addition to any other requirements imposed by the provisions of this chapter, the administrative personnel of any city, town, or county shall not approve a  final plat, as defined in RCW 58.17.020, for any subdivision,  lot, tract, parcel, or block which lies in whole or in part in an irrigation district organized pursuant to chapter 87.03 RCW unless there has been provided an irrigation water right-of-way for each portion of the subdivision, lot, tract, block, or parcel of land within such district.

Compliance with the requirements of this section together with all other applicable provisions of this chapter shall be a prerequisite, within the expressed purpose of this chapter, to any sale, lease, or development of land in this state.

## Section 22
1.

1. [Empty]

    a. Within 28 calendar days after receiving a project permit application, a local government planning pursuant to RCW 36.70A.040 shall provide a written determination to the applicant

that must state either:

        i. That the application is procedurally complete; or

        ii. That the application is procedurally incomplete and that the procedural submission requirements  have not been met. The determination shall identify the information necessary to make the application procedurally complete.

    c. To the extent known by the local government, the local government shall identify any other agencies of local, state, or federal governments that may have jurisdiction over some aspect of the application.

2. A project permit application is procedurally complete  when it meets the procedural submission requirements of the local government, as identified on the project permit application. Additional information , studies, or project modifications may be required after a determination of completeness. A determination of completeness does not preclude the local government's ability to request additional information or studies either at the time of the determination of completeness or later if new information is required or if substantial changes in the proposed action occur. However, once the procedural submission requirementshave been satisfied, the need for additional information or studies may not delay or preclude a completeness determination.

3. A determination of completeness may include or be combined with the following:

    a. A preliminary determination of those development regulations that will be used for project mitigation;

    b. A preliminary determination of consistency, as provided under RCW 36.70B.040;

    c. Other information the local government chooses to include; or

    d. The notice of application required under RCW 36.70B.110.

4. [Empty]

    a. An application shall be deemed procedurally complete on the 29th day after receipt if the local government does not provide a written determination to the applicant that the application is procedurally incomplete as provided in subsection (1)(a)(ii) of this section. The absence of a written determinationof completeness does not limit the local government's ability to request additional information or studies as provided for in subsection (2) of this section.

    b. Within 14 calendar days after an applicant submits additional information identified by the local government as  necessary to complete the application, the local government shall notify the applicant whether the application is procedurally complete or identify any remaining information required.

    c. The notice of application required under RCW 36.70B.110 shall be provided within 14 calendar days after the determination of completeness .

5. If a preapplication conference is required for a complete application, then the preapplication conference must:

    b. Answer questions from the applicant to facilitate preparation and submittal of a complete application.

## Section 24
1. [Empty]

    a. Development regulations adopted pursuant to RCW 36.70A.040 must establish and implement time periods for local government actions for each type of project permit application and provide timely and predictable procedures to determine whether a completed project permit application meets the requirements of those development regulations. Except for modifications by a jurisdiction provided for in (e) of this subsection, the time periods for local government actions for each type of complete project permit application or project type may not exceed those specified in this section.

    b. For project permits submitted after January 1, 2025, the development regulations must, for each type of permit application, specify the contents of a completed project permit application necessary for the complete compliance with the time periods and procedures.

    c. A jurisdiction may exclude certain permit types and timelines for processing project permit applications as provided for in RCW 36.70B.140.

    d. The time periods for local government action to issue a final decision for each type of complete project permit application or project type subject to this chapter should not exceed the following time periods unless modified by the local government pursuant to this section or RCW 36.70B.140:

        i. For project permits which do not require public notice under RCW 36.70B.110, a local government must issue a final decision within 65 days of the determination of completeness under RCW 36.70B.070;

        ii. For project permits which require public notice under RCW 36.70B.110, a local government must issue a final decision within 100 days of the determination of completeness under RCW 36.70B.070, provided a project permit application for preliminary plat approval pursuant to chapter 58.17 RCW is subject to the time period in (d)(iii) of this subsection notwithstanding an open record hearing not being required; and

        iii. For project permits which require public notice under RCW 36.70B.110 and a public hearing, a local government must issue a final decision within 170 days of the determination of completeness under RCW 36.70B.070.

    e. A jurisdiction may modify the provisions in (d) of this subsection to add permit types not identified, change the permit names or types in each category, address how consolidated review time periods may be different than permits submitted individually, and provide for how projects of a certain size or type may be differentiated, including by differentiating between permits that include a residential land use as a principal use of the land and permits that do not. Unless otherwise provided for the consolidated review of more than one permit, the time period for a final decision shall be the longest of the permit time periods identified in (d) of this subsection or as amended by a local government.

    f. If a local government does not adopt an ordinance or resolution modifying the provisions in (d) of this subsection, the time periods in (d) of this subsection apply.

    g. The number of days an application is in review with the county or city shall be calculated from the day completeness is determined under RCW 36.70B.070 to the date a final decision is issued on the project permit application. The number of days shall be calculated by counting every calendar day and excluding the following time periods:

        i. Any period between the day that the county or city has notified the applicant, in writing, that additional information is required to further process the application and the day when responsive information is resubmitted by the applicant;

        ii. Any period after an applicant informs the local government, in writing, that they would like to temporarily suspend review of the project permit application until the time that the applicant notifies the local government, in writing, that they would like to resume the application. A local government may set conditions for the temporary suspension of a permit application; and

        iii. Any period after an administrative appeal is filed until the administrative appeal is resolved and any additional time period provided by the administrative appeal has expired.

    h. The time periods for a local government to process a permit shall start over if an applicant proposes a change in use that adds or removes commercial or residential elements from the original application that would make the application fail to meet the determination of procedural completeness for the new use, as required by the local government under RCW 36.70B.070.

        i. If, at any time, an applicant informs the local government, in writing, that the applicant would like to temporarily suspend the review of the project for more than 60 days, or if an applicant is not responsive for more than 60 consecutive days after the county or city has notified the applicant, in writing, that additional information is required to further process the application, an additional 30 days may be added to the time periods for local government action to issue a final decision for each type of project permit that is subject to this chapter. Any written notice from the local government to the applicant that additional information is required to further process the application must include a notice that nonresponsiveness for 60 consecutive days may result in 30 days being added to the time for review. For the purposes of this subsection, "nonresponsiveness" means that an applicant is not making demonstrable progress on providing additional requested information to the local government, or that there is no ongoing communication from the applicant to the local government on the applicant's ability or willingness to provide the additional information.

    j. Annual amendments to the comprehensive plan are not subject to the requirements of this section.

    k. A county's or city's adoption of a resolution or ordinance to implement this subsection shall not be subject to appeal under chapter 36.70A RCW unless the resolution or ordinance modifies the time periods provided in (d) of this subsection by providing for a review period of more than 170 days for any project permit.

    l. [Empty]

        i. When permit time periods provided for in (d) of this subsection, as may be amended by a local government, and as may be extended as provided for in (i) of this subsection, are not met, a portion of the permit fee must be refunded to the applicant as provided in this subsection. A local government may provide for the collection of only 80 percent of a permit fee initially, and for the collection of the remaining balance if the permitting time periods are met. The portion of the fee refunded for missing time periods shall be:

(A) 10 percent if the final decision of the project permit application was made after the applicable deadline but the period from the passage of the deadline to the time of issuance of the final decision did not exceed 20 percent of the original time period; or

(B) 20 percent if the period from the passage of the deadline to the time of the issuance of the final decision exceeded 20 percent of the original time period.

        ii. Except as provided in RCW 36.70B.160, the provisions in (l)(i) of this subsection are not applicable to cities and counties which have implemented at least three of the options in RCW 36.70B.160(1) (a) through (j) at the time an application is deemed procedurally complete.

        ii. The total number of decisions issued during the year for the following permit types: Preliminary subdivisions, final subdivisions, binding site plans, permit processes associated with the approval of multifamily housing, and construction plan review for each of these permit types when submitted separately;

        iii. The total number of decisions for each permit type which included consolidated project permit review, such as concurrent review of a rezone or construction plans;

        iv. The average number of days from a submittal to a decision being issued for the project permit types listed in (b)(ii) of this subsection. This shall be calculated from the day completeness is determined under RCW 36.70B.070 to the date a decision is issued on the application. The number of days shall be calculated by counting every calendar day;

    v. The total number of days each project permit application of a type listed in (b)(ii) of this subsection was in review with the county or city. This shall be calculated from the day completeness is determined under RCW 36.70B.070 to the date a final decision is issued on the application. The number of days shall be calculated by counting every calendar day. The days the application is in review with the county or city does not include the time periods in subsection (1)(g)(i) through (iii) of this section;

    vi. The total number of days that were excluded from the time period calculation under subsection (1)(g)(i) through (iii) of this section for each project permit application of a type listed in (b)(ii) of this subsection.

    c. Counties and cities subject to the requirements of this subsection must:

        i. Post the annual performance report through the county's or city's website; and

        ii. Submit the annual performance report to the department of commerce by March 1st each year.

    d. No later than July 1st each year, the department of commerce shall publish a report which includes the annual performance report data for each county and city subject to the requirements of this subsection and a list of those counties and cities whose time periods are shorter than those provided for in this section.

The annual report must also include key metrics and findings from the information collected.

    e. The initial annual report required under this subsection must be submitted to the department of commerce by March 1, 2025, and must include information from permitting in 2024.

3. Nothing in this section prohibits a county or city from extending a deadline for issuing a decision for a specific project permit application for any reasonable and certain period of time specified and mutually agreed upon in writing by the applicant and the local government. No local government may require or request an extension of an applicable deadline for issuance of a decision for a specific project permit application as a condition or an option at initial submission of a project permit application.
