<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The statutes in chapter 58.17 RCW governing the subdivision of land in Washington state were originally enacted in 1969;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The subdivision process as originally enacted has evolved in practice and implementation by local jurisdictions over 50 years such that a preliminary plat of today has the level of detail of what previously was considered for a final plat;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The subdivision statutes have not been comprehensively updated since the adoption of (i) chapter 36.70A RCW, the growth management act (GMA), (ii) the statutes regarding local project review in chapter 36.70B RCW, and (iii) the statutes integrating project review under chapter 43.21C RCW, the state environmental policy act (SEPA) with the planning requirements under the GMA;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The submittal requirements for a short plat have evolved to become essentially the same as required for a subdivision making the distinction between a short plat and a subdivision obsolete; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington state faces a crisis in housing supply and affordability to provide housing needed for the population growth projected for the state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In light of the foregoing, the legislature deems it necessary to update the statutes governing the division of land and alteration of property boundaries to provide for a uniform and expeditious process and integrate the subdivision process with the requirements under the GMA, local project review, and SEPA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To further these goals, the legislature intends to make the plat approval process administrative for jurisdictions planning under the GMA, and to update the subdivision statutes through adoption of a new chapter 58.17A RCW.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the process by which land is divided is a matter of state concern and should be administered uniformly by cities, towns, and counties throughout the state. The purpose of this chapter is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Regulate the division of land and alteration of property boundaries and to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare in accordance with standards established by the state; to promote efficient use of land consistent with requirements for those cities, towns, and counties planning under the growth management act, chapter 36.70A RCW;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote safe and convenient travel by the public on streets and highways;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide for adequate light and air;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitate adequate provision for water, sewerage, parks and recreation areas, sites for schools and schoolgrounds, and other public requirements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide for proper ingress and egress;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide for the expeditious review of applications for proposed subdivisions consistent with RCW 36.70A.020(7) and chapter 36.70B RCW;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide for the approval of proposed subdivisions that conform to local comprehensive plans, zoning, and development regulations adopted by cities, towns, and counties;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adequately provide for the housing and commercial needs of the citizens of the state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Require uniform monumenting of subdivisions; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Require conveyances of land by accurate legal description.</p>

<h2 id="section-7">Section 7 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A city, town, or county may adopt by ordinance procedures for the division of land into lots, tracts, or parcels through approval and recording of a binding site plan as an alternate method to the subdivision procedures under this chapter only for the following purposes:</p>
<ol type="a">

<p>Divisions of land for lease as provided for in section 9(5) of this act; and</p>
</li>

<p>Divisions of land as provided for in section 9(7) of this act. A binding site plan ordinance may apply the same or different requirements and procedures to each of the three types of authorized divisions; must provide for administrative approval of a binding site plan; and must provide processes for altering and vacating a binding site plan.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A binding site plan ordinance must provide that after approval of the general binding site plan for industrial, commercial, or mixed-use divisions subject to a binding site plan, the approval for improvements and finalization of specific individual commercial, industrial, or mixed-use lots must be reviewed and approved administratively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The binding site plan, after approval, or when specific lots are administratively approved, must be filed with the county auditor together with a record of survey. Lots, tracts, blocks, or other divisions created through the binding site plan procedure must be legal lots of record upon recording of the binding site plan. The number of lots or tracts may not exceed the number of lots allowed by the local zoning ordinances and development regulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A binding site plan filed for record pursuant to section 9(7) of this act may, but need not, depict or describe the boundaries of the lots or tracts resulting from subjecting a portion of the land to either chapter 64.32 or 64.34 RCW, but must contain the following statement:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&quot;All development and use of the land described herein must be in accordance with this binding site plan, as it may be amended with the approval of the city, town, or county having jurisdiction over the development of such land, and in accordance with such other governmental permits, approvals, regulations, requirements, and restrictions that may be imposed upon such land and the development and use thereof. Upon completion, the improvements on the land must be included in one or more condominiums or owned by an association or other legal entity in which the owners of units therein or their owners' associations have a membership or other legal or beneficial interest. This binding site plan is binding upon all now or hereafter having any interest in the land described herein.&quot;</p>
<p>A binding site plan submitted pursuant to section 9(7) of this act must be deemed to have been approved if the site plan was approved by a city, town, or county either:</p>
<pre><code>a. In connection with the approval of a final plat with respect to all of such land;

b. In connection with the issuance of building permits or final certificates of occupancy with respect to all of such land; or

c. If not approved pursuant to (a) and (b) of this subsection, then pursuant to such other procedures as such city, town, or county may have established for the approval of a binding site plan.

<ol>
<li>
<p>Cities that are required to comply with the minimum density requirements under RCW 36.70A.635 may adopt by ordinance, and incorporate into their development regulations, zoning regulations, and other official controls consistent with the requirements of subsection (2) of this section, to take effect on or before the applicability date for such jurisdiction pursuant to sections 46 and 47 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through ordinances, development regulations, zoning regulations, and other official controls as required under subsection (1) of this section, cities may allow within a zone that primarily allows residential uses an administrative minor plat to create one new residential lot if the following conditions are met:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>No more than one new lot is created through a minor plat. A minor plat is not authorized for properties in zones that primarily allow nonresidential uses such as business, commercial, retail, and/or industrial;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lot created through a minor plat may be further segregated through either:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>A unit lot subdivision to segregate middle housing units into separate legal parcels subject to the applicable residential density the city is required to allow pursuant to RCW 36.70A.635; or</p>

<li>
<p>A subdivision provided the total number of lots in such subdivision does not exceed the density allowed under the applicable zoning;</p>

<li>
<p>The parent lot and the new lot or lots resulting from the administrative minor plat both meet the applicable minimum lot size allowed under RCW 36.70A.635;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The parent lot was not created through the dividing of a single-family residential lot authorized by this section; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The minor plat would not require demolition or alteration of any existing housing that is rent restricted, rent subsidized, or that has been occupied by a tenant paying market-rate rent within the preceding 12 months.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A city that elects to allow minor plats shall establish procedural and substantive standards through which an administrative minor plat is reviewed and approved administratively and not subject to an administrative appeal if certain criteria are met. A city may adopt additional standards or criteria that are not inconsistent with this subsection. The criteria must include that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The lots resulting from the minor plat meet the minimum lot size under the city's development regulations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lots resulting from the minor plat will not require a reasonable use exception for subsequent development;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The applicable sewer and water purveyor or purveyors have issued certificates of availability to serve the newly created lot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access rights are granted or conveyed as necessary on or before recording of the final minor plat to provide access for the maximum number of dwelling units that could be developed on the newly created lot, provided such access rights may be reduced consistent with a city's adopted codes, regulations, and design standards as applicable through review of a subsequent application for a building permit, unit lot subdivision, or subdivision application, if less than the maximum number of dwelling units is built on the newly created lot; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A proposed minor plat may be conditioned upon dedication of right-of-way on the parent lot to the extent such dedication would otherwise be required under applicable codes, regulations, and design standards for the development or subdivision of the parent lot absent the minor plat. Similarly, a subsequent application for development of housing units on the newly created lot may be conditioned upon construction of frontage improvements to right-of-way adjacent to either the parent parcel or the newly created lots to the extent such improvements would be required under applicable codes, regulations, and design standards. An administrative minor plat may not be subject to subdivision requirements, including those set forth in section 12 of this act, other than the requirement for a final minor plat and the requirements of this subsection (3).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The final minor plat must include a restriction providing that the approval and recording of an administrative minor plat does not constitute or guarantee approval by the city of other permits and approvals that may be necessary to construct residential units on the lots resulting from the minor plat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any construction on the resulting lots is subject to all existing state and local laws except for the provisions specified in this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A city electing to authorize a division of land through a minor plat may not impose a limit on the total number of dwelling units allowed on the new residential lot and the original lot that is less than the number of residential dwelling units allowed by the underlying zoning of the original lot prior to the administrative minor plat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a city must deny an application for an administrative minor plat if one or both resulting lots would not have sufficient developable land because of the presence of critical areas or their buffers on the lot.</p>

<p>When any person with an ownership interest in all or portions of a subdivision is interested in the alteration of any subdivision or the altering of any portion thereof, except as provided in section 9(6) of this act, that person or a duly authorized representative may submit an application to request the alteration to the legislative body of the city, town, or county where the subdivision is located. The application must be signed by a majority of those persons having an ownership interest of lots, tracts, or parcels in the subject subdivision that are proposed to be altered, however, the application for the alteration of any lots, tracts, or parcels held in common ownership by all lot owners in the subdivision must be signed by the majority of all such owners. If the subdivision is subject to restrictive covenants applicable to the final plat of the subdivision, and the application for alteration would result in the violation of a covenant, the application must contain an agreement signed by all parties subject to the covenants providing that the parties agree to terminate or alter the relevant covenants to accomplish the purpose of the alteration of the subdivision or portion thereof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon receipt of an application for alteration, the legislative body shall provide notice of the application to all owners of property within the subdivision, and as provided for in regulations adopted by the city, town, or county adopted pursuant to chapter 36.70B RCW. The notice must either establish a date for a public hearing or provide that a hearing may be requested by a person receiving notice within 14 days of receipt of the notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislative body may deny or approve the application based on its determination whether the proposed alteration would serve the public use and interest. If any land within the subdivision proposed for alteration is part of an assessment district, any outstanding assessments must be equitably divided and levied against the remaining lots, parcels, or tracts, or be levied equitably on the lots resulting from the alteration. If any land within the alteration contains a dedication to the general use of persons residing within the subdivision, such land may be altered and divided equitably between the adjacent properties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After approval of the alteration, the legislative body shall order the applicant to produce a revised drawing of the approved alteration of the final plat, which after signature of the legislative body, must be filed with the county auditor to become the lawful plat of the property.</p>

In addition, if the subdivision, lot, tract, parcel, or site lies within land within the district classified as irrigable, completed irrigation water distribution facilities for such land may be required by the irrigation district by resolution, bylaw, or rule of general applicability as a condition for approval of the final plat by the legislative authority of the city, town, or county. Rights-of-way must be evidenced by the respective plats submitted for final approval to the appropriate legislative body. In addition, if the subdivision, lot, tract, parcel, or site to be platted is wholly or partially within an irrigation district of 200,000 acres or more and has been previously platted by the United States bureau of reclamation as a farm unit in the district, the plat or final plat as defined in section 3 of this act may not be approved by a city, town, or county without the approval of the irrigation district and the administrator or manager of the project of the bureau of reclamation, or its successor agency, within which that district lies.
