# SB 5335 - Rural nursing education

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5335-S.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that sustainable change is needed for rural health care nursing education. Nursing is the largest health care profession in the United States, yet rural hospitals, affiliated clinics, and underserved rural communities are experiencing a shortage of skilled registered nurses, including nurse practitioners who begin their careers as registered nurses, making it even more difficult to meet the health care needs of rural and underserved populations.

The legislature finds the major barriers that rural nursing students face are lack of access to affordable child care, lack of transportation and safe and extended commute times, and lack of access to internet services and computers. The added burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, subsequent reports of staff burnout, nurses leaving the profession, and higher salaries in urban areas has made it difficult for rural health care facilities, such as the state's 39 critical access hospitals, to compete with larger hospital systems in attracting and retaining a qualified workforce. Nurses living and working in rural communities are in short supply and high demand. Rural hospitals rely heavily on a substitute workforce such as traveling nurses, which is costly, unsustainable, and has significant recruitment and retention challenges.

The legislature recognizes the rural nursing education program, a statewide program created in 2023 by a collaboration of health care stakeholders, addresses the concerns of the rural nursing workforce. The program fosters community-based collaborations between academic institutions, students, and rural community health care partners and has developed a remote grow-your-own nursing education plan that educates prelicensure students as registered nurses who want to learn, live, and work in their rural communities as registered nurses. The program plans to initially offer associate degree prelicensure education with the addition of future programs when resources are available. The legislature intends to codify the program as the rural nursing education program to create a future where underserved rural communities are fully staffed with qualified nurses and thrive with robust health care services staffed by local talent.
