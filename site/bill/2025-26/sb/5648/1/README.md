# SB 5648 - ABLE accounts

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5648.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that:

1. In 2016, legislation was enacted to implement the Washington achieving a better life experience (ABLE) program to allow persons with qualifying disabilities to create tax-advantaged savings accounts known as ABLE accounts. Eligible individuals currently include persons with significant physical, behavioral, developmental, or military disabilities with an age of onset of disability before turning 26 years of age. Eligible individuals can contribute their own earnings to their ABLE accounts as well as accept contributions from family members and employers. ABLE accounts can be used to fund a wide range of expenses related to the eligible individual's disability without risking eligibility for means-tested public benefits such as medicaid and supplemental security income.

2. Increasing participation in the ABLE program helps the individual by increasing self-reliance, encouraging employment, and improving quality of life, and helps the program by keeping account fees low. Recognizing the benefits of the ABLE program, congress recently enacted the ABLE age adjustment act that would raise the threshold for the onset of a qualifying disability to age 46 beginning January 2026. The purpose of this act is to encourage participation in the ABLE program by providing funding for program promotion, reducing individual account fees, and to contribute funding to ABLE accounts.

## Section 2
1. The encouraging achieving a better life experience account, also known as the ENABLE account, is created in the custody of the state treasurer. Moneys from legislative appropriations and transfers, federal funds, public or private donations, gifts, and grants, and any other lawful source may be deposited into the account. Expenditures from the account may be used only for the following purposes in the following priority:

    a. Up to $250,000 or 0.25 percent of the balance of the account on July 1st of each fiscal year, whichever is less, may be used for administrative and promotional expenses for that fiscal year;

    b. Reducing or eliminating fees charged against individual Washington achieving a better life experience program accounts to administer or invest moneys in each account, up to a maximum of $50 annually per account;

    c. Depositing $1,000 into each individual Washington achieving a better life experience program account in existence on July 1, 2025; and

    d. Depositing $1,000 into each new individual Washington achieving a better life experience program account opened in Washington state after July 1, 2025, or an existing account rolled over into an individual Washington achieving a better life experience program account after July 1, 2025.

2. Only the director of the Washington achieving a better life experience governing board or the board's designee may authorize expenditures from the account. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures. If any deposit from the ENABLE account into an individual Washington achieving a better life experience program account would result in the individual exceeding the contribution limit allowed under internal revenue service regulations, the individual may defer the ENABLE deposit for up to two years to prevent exceeding the limit.

## Section 3
