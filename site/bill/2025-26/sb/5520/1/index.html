</li>
<li>
<p>Any pardon or proclamation issued to the claimant must be certified by the officer having lawful custody of the pardon or proclamation, and be affixed with the seal of the office of the governor, or with the official certificate of such officer before it may be offered as evidence.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The claimant may not be compensated for any period of time in which he or she was serving a term of imprisonment or a concurrent sentence for any conviction other than the felony or felonies that are the basis for the claim.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>$70,000 for each year of actual confinement including time spent awaiting trial and an additional $70,000 for each year served under a sentence of death ;</p>

<li>
<p>Upon finding that the claimant was wrongly convicted, the court must seal the claimant's record of conviction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon request of the claimant, the court may order the claimant's record of conviction vacated if the record has not already been vacated, expunged, or destroyed under court rules. The requirements for vacating records under RCW 9.94A.640 do not apply.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The claimant or the attorney general may initiate and agree to a claim with a structured settlement for the compensation awarded under  this section. During negotiation of the structured settlement agreement, the claimant must be given adequate time to consult with the legal and financial advisor of his or her choice. Any structured settlement agreement binds the parties with regard to all compensation awarded. A structured settlement agreement entered into under this section must be in writing and signed by the parties or their representatives and must clearly state that the parties understand and agree to the terms of the agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before approving any structured settlement agreement, the court must ensure that the claimant has an adequate understanding of the agreement. The court may approve the agreement only if the judge finds that the agreement is in the best interest of the claimant and actuarially equivalent to a lump sum compensation award under  this section before taxation. When determining whether the agreement is in the best interest of the claimant, the court must consider the following factors:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The age and life expectancy of the claimant;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The marital or domestic partnership status of the claimant; and</p>

<p>The clemency and pardons board or the indeterminate sentence review board, whichever is applicable, upon issuance of a pardon, amnesty, commutation, or reprieve by the governor on grounds consistent with innocence on or after July 28, 2013, must provide a copy of this chapter and RCW  28B.15.395 and 72.09.750 to the individual pardoned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an individual entitled to receive the information required under this section shows that he or she was not provided with the information, he or she has an additional six years, beyond the statute of limitations under RCW 4.100.090, to bring a claim under this chapter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-7">Section 7 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that the monetary compensation calculated under this chapter shall establish the monetary minimum compensation owed to a claimant pursuant to a wrongful conviction. If  the claimant is awarded compensation under this chapter and receives a tort award from the state or any political subdivision of the state related to his or her wrongful conviction , the claimant must reimburse the state for the lesser of:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The amount of the compensation award, excluding the portion awarded pursuant to RCW 4.100.060(5) (c) through (d) and (6); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amount received by the claimant under the tort award.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A release dismissal agreement, plea agreement, or any similar agreement whereby a prosecutor's office or an agent acting on its behalf agrees to take or refrain from certain action if the accused individual agrees to forgo legal action against the county, the state of Washington, or any political subdivision, is admissible and should be evaluated in light of all the evidence. However, any such agreement is not dispositive of the question of whether the claimant was wrongly convicted or entitled to compensation under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A claimant who receives a judgment for a monetary award under RCW 4.100.060 is entitled to receive an advance on the compensation award from the state general fund within 30 days of the judgment, which shall be repaid upon receipt of the full compensation award or deducted from the full compensation award. The advance shall be in an amount adjusted for inflation that is actuarially equal to one year of compensation under RCW 4.100.060(5)(a), or the full amount of compensation awarded by the court, whichever is less.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-8">Section 8 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-8">¶</a></h2>
<p>Except as provided in RCW 4.100.070, an action for compensation under this chapter must be commenced within six years after the grant of a pardon or other executive relief, the grant of judicial relief and satisfaction of other conditions described in this chapter, or release from custody, whichever is later. Any action by the state challenging or appealing the grant of judicial relief or release from custody shall toll the six-year period. Any person meeting the criteria set forth in this chapter who was wrongly convicted before July 28, 2013, may commence an action under this chapter within three years after the effective date of this section.</p>
<h2 id="section-9">Section 9 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9">¶</a></h2>
