13. Before approving any structured settlement agreement, the court must ensure that the claimant has an adequate understanding of the agreement.

## Section 7
1. It is the intent of the legislature that the monetary compensation calculated under this chapter shall establish the monetary minimum compensation owed to a claimant pursuant to a wrongful conviction. If  the claimant is awarded compensation under this chapter and receives a tort award from the state or any political subdivision of the state related to his or her wrongful conviction , the claimant must reimburse the state for the lesser of:

    a. The amount of the compensation award, excluding the portion awarded pursuant to RCW 4.100.060(5) (c) through (d) and (6); or

    b. The amount received by the claimant under the tort award.

2. A release dismissal agreement, plea agreement, or any similar agreement whereby a prosecutor's office or an agent acting on its behalf agrees to take or refrain from certain action if the accused individual agrees to forgo legal action against the county, the state of Washington, or any political subdivision, is admissible and should be evaluated in light of all the evidence. However, any such agreement is not dispositive of the question of whether the claimant was wrongly convicted or entitled to compensation under this chapter.

3. A claimant who receives a judgment for a monetary award under RCW 4.100.060 is entitled to receive an advance on the compensation award from the state general fund within 30 days of the judgment, which shall be repaid upon receipt of the full compensation award or deducted from the full compensation award. The advance shall be in an amount adjusted for inflation that is actuarially equal to one year of compensation under RCW 4.100.060(5)(a), or the full amount of compensation awarded by the court, whichever is less.

## Section 8
Except as provided in RCW 4.100.070, an action for compensation under this chapter must be commenced within six years after the grant of a pardon or other executive relief, the grant of judicial relief and satisfaction of other conditions described in this chapter, or release from custody, whichever is later. Any action by the state challenging or appealing the grant of judicial relief or release from custody shall toll the six-year period. Any person meeting the criteria set forth in this chapter who was wrongly convicted before July 28, 2013, may commence an action under this chapter within three years after the effective date of this section.
