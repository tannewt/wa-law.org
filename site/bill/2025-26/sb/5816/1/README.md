## Section 1
The legislature finds that it is in the best interest of the state to ensure efficient production and marketing of agricultural products produced in the state. There is a process in place through which fair prices and other contract terms can be negotiated. The legislature finds that producers of grapes that are intended as a nonfermented juice product should be included in that process.
