[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5416.pdf)

## Section 1
It shall be the policy of the state of Washington to:

1. Recognize the family as the most important social and economic unit of society and support the central role parents play in child rearing. All parents are encouraged to care for and nurture their children through the traditional methods of parental care at home. The availability of quality, affordable child care is a concern for working parents, the costs of care are often beyond the resources of working parents, and child care facilities are not located conveniently to workplaces and neighborhoods. Parents are encouraged to participate fully in the effort to improve the quality of child care services;

2. Promote a variety of culturally and developmentally appropriate child care settings and services of the highest possible quality in accordance with the basic principle of continuity of care. These settings shall include, but not be limited to, family day care homes, outdoor nature-based child care, centers, and schools;

3. Promote the growth, development and safety of children by working with community groups including providers and parents to establish standards for quality service, training of child care providers, fair and equitable monitoring, and salary levels commensurate with provider responsibilities and support services;

4. Promote equal access to quality, affordable, socio-economically integrated child care for all children and families;

5. Facilitate broad community and private sector involvement in the provision of quality child care services to foster economic development and assist industry through the department; and

6. Ensure consistent, equitable, fair, and collaborative licensing enforcements to protect the health and safety of children while promoting discussion and cooperation between licensors and child care providers.

## Section 2

In addition to other duties under this chapter, the secretary shall actively participate in a nongovernmental private-public partnership focused on supporting government's investments in early learning and ensuring that every child in the state is prepared to succeed in school and in life. Except for licensing as required by Washington state law and to the extent permitted by federal law, the secretary shall grant waivers from the rules of state agencies for the operation of early learning programs requested by the nongovernmental private-public partnership to allow for flexibility to pursue market-based approaches to achieving the best outcomes for children and families.

    a. Enter into contracts on behalf of the department to carry out the purposes of this chapter;

    b. Accept gifts, grants, or other funds for the purposes of this chapter; and

    c. Adopt, in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW, rules necessary to implement this chapter, including rules governing child  care and early learning programs under this chapter. Rules governing child care licensing must be limited to protecting the health and safety of children and must be in accordance with RCW 43.216.250. This section does not expand the rule-making authority of the secretary beyond that necessary to implement and administer programs and services existing July 1, 2006, as transferred to the department of early learning under section 501, chapter 265, Laws of 2006.
