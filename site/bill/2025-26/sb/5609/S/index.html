<ol>
<li>
<p>If the requirements of subsection (2) of this section are satisfied, a county, city, or town reviewing a project action shall determine that the requirements for environmental analysis, protection, and mitigation measures in the county, city, or town's development regulations and comprehensive plans adopted under chapter 36.70A RCW, and in other applicable local, state, or federal laws and rules provide adequate analysis of and mitigation for the specific adverse environmental impacts of the project action to which the requirements apply. Rules adopted by the department according to RCW 43.21C.110 regarding project specific impacts that may not have been adequately addressed apply to any determination made under this section. In these situations, in which all adverse environmental impacts will be mitigated below the level of significance as a result of mitigation measures included by changing, clarifying, or conditioning of the proposed action and/or regulatory requirements of development regulations adopted under chapter 36.70A RCW or other local, state, or federal laws, a determination of nonsignificance or a mitigated determination of nonsignificance is the proper threshold determination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A county, city, or town shall make the determination provided for in subsection (1) of this section if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>In the course of project review, including any required environmental analysis, the local government considers the specific probable adverse environmental impacts of the proposed action and determines that these specific impacts are adequately addressed by the development regulations or other applicable requirements of the comprehensive plan, subarea plan element of the comprehensive plan, or other local, state, or federal rules or laws;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning July 1, 2029, the local government has adopted an ordinance protecting archaeological and cultural resources developed in consultation with affected federally recognized Indian tribes and consistent with the model ordinance developed by the department of archaeology and historic preservation under section 2 of this act; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The local government bases or conditions its approval on compliance with these requirements or mitigation measures.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a county, city, or town's comprehensive plans, subarea plans, and development regulations adequately address a project's probable specific adverse environmental impacts, as determined under subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the county, city, or town shall not impose additional mitigation under this chapter during project review. Project review shall be integrated with environmental analysis under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A comprehensive plan, subarea plan, or development regulation shall be considered to adequately address an impact if the county, city, or town, through the planning and environmental review process under chapter 36.70A RCW and this chapter, has identified the specific adverse environmental impacts and:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The impacts have been avoided or otherwise mitigated; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislative body of the county, city, or town has designated as acceptable certain levels of service, land use designations, development standards, or other land use planning required or allowed by chapter 36.70A RCW.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In deciding whether a specific adverse environmental impact has been addressed by an existing rule or law of another agency with jurisdiction with environmental expertise with regard to a specific environmental impact, the county, city, or town shall consult orally or in writing with that agency and may expressly defer to that agency. In making this deferral, the county, city, or town shall base or condition its project approval on compliance with these other existing rules or laws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section limits the authority of an agency in its review or mitigation of a project to adopt or otherwise rely on environmental analyses and requirements under other laws, as provided by this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section shall apply only to a county, city, or town planning under RCW 36.70A.040.</p>
</li>
</ol>
