<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that rapid advances in artificial intelligence technology, including generative and conversational models capable of simulating human-like interaction, have created new forms of digital companionship. While these systems, commonly referred to as AI companion chatbots, may offer benefits, such as accessible emotional support and engagement, they also present significant risks, particularly to minors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that AI companion chatbots can sustain prolonged, personalized, and emotionally adaptive conversations that may influence user beliefs, feelings, and behaviors. When used by minors, there is greater risk that these systems may blur the distinction between human and artificial interaction, potentially leading to emotional dependency, exposure to inappropriate or sexually explicit material, or reinforcement of harmful ideation, including self-harm or suicide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that, unlike social media platforms or video games, AI companion chatbots are uniquely capable of imitating empathy, affection, or intimacy through natural language processing, emotional recognition algorithms, and behavioral modeling. These capabilities raise new concerns regarding psychological safety, transparency, and accountability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Promote transparency by requiring clear and ongoing disclosure that AI companion chatbots are artificial systems, not human interlocutors;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish safeguards to detect and respond to user expressions of self-harm, suicidal ideation, or emotional crisis;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Require additional protections for minors, including restrictions on sexually explicit content and additional, recurring reminders about the artificial nature of such systems; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support transparency in suicide prevention efforts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is further the intent of the legislature that the operation of AI companion chatbots in Washington state be conducted in a manner that upholds user dignity, psychological safety, and transparency, while fostering responsible innovation in artificial intelligence technologies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
