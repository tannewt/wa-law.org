<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes the need for clinical treatment for serious and otherwise treatment-resistant conditions. The legislature recognizes that scientific evidence has found that psilocybin can provide medically significant relief for diagnosed conditions. The legislature recognizes the importance of clear training standards, oversight mechanisms, and protections for clinicians and patients. The legislature therefore resolves to create the Washington medical use of psilocybin program under the supervision of the department of health to provide safe access to needed medical treatment services.</p>
