# SB 5437 - Noncompetition agreements

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5437.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that:

1. Workforce mobility is important to economic growth and development;

2. Agreements limiting competition or hiring restrain trade and commerce and may be contracts of adhesion that may be unreasonable; and

3. The provisions in this chapter facilitating workforce mobility and protecting employees and independent contractors must be liberally construed and exceptions narrowly construed. In addition, nonsolicitation agreements, which prohibit an employee from actively soliciting current customers or employees away from the employer, are not prohibited; however, the definition of nonsolicitation agreement must be narrowly construed.

## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1.

"Employee" and "employer" have the same meanings as in RCW 49.17.020.

2. "Franchisor" and "franchisee" have the same meanings as in RCW 19.100.010.

3. [Empty]

    a. "Noncompetition covenant" includes every written or oral covenant, agreement, or contract that prohibits or restrains an employee or independent contractor  from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind.

    b. "A noncompetition covenant" also includes a covenant, agreement, or contract between a performer and a performance space, or a third party scheduling the performer for a performance space, that prohibits or restrains the performer from engaging in a lawful performance.

    c. A "noncompetition covenant" also includes an agreement that directly or indirectly prohibits the acceptance or transaction of business with a customer.

    d. A "noncompetition covenant" also includes any provision in an agreement that threatens, demands, requires, or otherwise effectuates that an individual return, repay, or forfeit any right, benefit, or compensation, as a consequence of the individual engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind.

    e. A "noncompetition covenant" does not include: (i) A nonsolicitation agreement; (ii) a confidentiality agreement; (iii) a covenant prohibiting use or disclosure of trade secrets or inventions; (iv) a covenant entered into by a person purchasing or selling the goodwill of a business or otherwise acquiring or disposing of an ownership interest, but only if the person signing the covenant purchases, sells, acquires, or disposes of an ownership interest representing one percent or more of the business; or (v) a covenant entered into by a franchisee when the franchise sale complies with RCW 19.100.020(1).

4. "Nonsolicitation agreement" means an agreement between an employer and employee that prohibits solicitation by an employee, upon termination of employment: (a) Of any employee of the employer to leave the employer; or (b) of any current customer of the employer to cease or reduce the extent to which it is doing business with the employer. An agreement that directly or indirectly prohibits the acceptance or transaction of business with a customer is not a "nonsolicitation agreement."

5. "Party seeking enforcement" means the named plaintiff or claimant in a proceeding to enforce a noncompetition covenant or the defendant in an action for declaratory relief.

## Section 3

3. By October 1, 2025, an employer must provide to current employees, former employees, and independent contractors, who were required to enter into noncompetition covenants or whose contracts include noncompetition covenants, a written notice that the noncompetition covenant is void and unenforceable.

## Section 4
1. Upon a violation of this chapter, the attorney general, on behalf of a person or persons, may pursue any and all relief. A person aggrieved by a violation of this chapter may bring a cause of action to pursue any and all relief provided for in subsection (2)  of this section.

2. If a court or arbitrator determines that a person has violated this chapter, the violator must pay the aggrieved person the greater of his or her actual damages or a statutory penalty of five thousand dollars, plus reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses, and costs incurred in the proceeding.
