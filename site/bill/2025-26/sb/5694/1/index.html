<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that there are only three jurisdictions that regulate the safe operation of boilers by certified boiler operators. The national board of boiler and pressure vessel inspectors has advised that trained boiler operators are essential to avoiding potential risks to personnel, the public, and property.</p>
<p>The national board stated that &quot;The primary concern in the operation of boilers, regardless of pressure or type, is safety. Too often, automatic features lead owners and the general public to believe that the equipment will function without worker oversight, maintenance, operation, and repair. A boiler can fail regardless of its level of automation and a boiler failure can lead to catastrophic results. Even the automatic controls must be properly maintained and tested at specific intervals to keep them functioning properly.&quot;</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that ensuring boiler safety is critical and the best way to achieve this goal is through the unification of the existing certification and training expectations for the entire state to ensure portability of the certification and that the workers in this field possess the necessary skills, training, and abilities for the safe operation, maintenance, and repair of boilers. This act is intended not to create a drastically new system, but to utilize the currently recognized certification programs for certification of all workers. A worker who retains certification from any jurisdiction having the authority, and approved by the board, to administer an approved boiler operator certification program is intended to be considered appropriately certified and compliant with this act. The role of the department of labor and industries is intended to be to enforce that these certification requirements are complied with.</p>
