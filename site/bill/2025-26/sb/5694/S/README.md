# SB 5694 - Boiler operator cert.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5694-S.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that there are only three jurisdictions that regulate the safe operation of boilers by certified boiler operators. The national board of boiler and pressure vessel inspectors has advised that trained boiler operators are essential to avoiding potential risks to personnel, the public, and property.

The national board stated that "The primary concern in the operation of boilers, regardless of pressure or type, is safety. Too often, automatic features lead owners and the general public to believe that the equipment will function without worker oversight, maintenance, operation, and repair. A boiler can fail regardless of its level of automation and a boiler failure can lead to catastrophic results. Even the automatic controls must be properly maintained and tested at specific intervals to keep them functioning properly."

The legislature further finds that ensuring boiler safety is critical and the best way to achieve this goal is through the unification of the existing certification and training expectations for the entire state to ensure portability of the certification and that the workers in this field possess the necessary skills, training, and abilities for the safe operation, maintenance, and repair of boilers. This act is intended not to create a drastically new system, but to utilize the currently recognized certification programs for certification of all workers. A worker who retains certification from any jurisdiction having the authority, and approved by the board, to administer an approved boiler operator certification program is intended to be considered appropriately certified and compliant with this act. The role of the department of labor and industries is intended to be to enforce that these certification requirements are complied with.

## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Board" means the board of boiler rules established pursuant to RCW 70.79.010.

2. "Department" means the department of labor and industries.

## Section 3
The board shall formulate definitions and rules for the safe and proper construction, installation, repair, use, and operation of boilers , the safe and proper construction, installation, and repair of unfired pressure vessels in this state, and for certification of boiler operators. The definitions and rules so formulated shall be based upon, and, at all times, follow the nationally or internationally accepted engineering standards, formulae, and practices established and pertaining to boiler and unfired pressure vessel construction and safety, and the board may by resolution adopt existing published codifications thereof, and when so adopted the same shall be deemed incorporated into, and to constitute a part or the whole of the definitions and rules of the board. Amendments and interpretations to the code shall be enforceable immediately upon being adopted, to the end that the definitions and rules shall at all times follow nationally or internationally accepted engineering standards. However, all rules adopted by the board shall be adopted in compliance with the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW, as now or hereafter amended.

## Section 4
1. The board shall promulgate rules and regulations for the safe and proper installation, repair, use, and operation of boilers, and for the safe and proper installation and repair of unfired pressure vessels which were in use or installed ready for use in this state prior to the date upon which the first rules and regulations under this chapter pertaining to existing installations became effective, or during the 12-month period immediately thereafter.

    c. The certificate holder has violated any provision of this chapter or any rule adopted under this chapter.

2. Before a boiler operator certification is revoked or suspended, the department shall send written notice using a method by which the mailing can be tracked or the delivery confirmed to the certificate holder's last known address. The notice must list the allegations against the certificate holder and give the certificate holder the opportunity to request, within 20 days of receiving the notice, a hearing before the board.

3. The department may not assess a penalty under this section until the board adopts rules related to the method it uses to calculate penalties for violations of boiler operator requirements.

4. The department must notify the violator of its action, and the reasons for its action, in writing. The department must send the notice to the violator using a method by which the mailing can be tracked or the delivery confirmed. A hearing may be requested under RCW 70.79.361.
