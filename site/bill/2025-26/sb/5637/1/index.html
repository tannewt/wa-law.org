<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that inadequate media literacy skills and limited civic knowledge have become an issue among the youth in Washington state, necessitating the deployment of media literacy and civic engagement resources in schools throughout the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Many high school and middle school students struggle to distinguish between real news and fake news articles and do not verify suspicious information;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The spread of realistic images or videos of people that have been altered to appear as somebody else, or &quot;deepfakes,&quot; has fueled harmful online misinformation campaigns;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Media literacy training educates students on how to properly distinguish between different news sources, information, bias, and more;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Media literacy promotes informed engagement with media platforms and prevents polarization among community members;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to a survey of young adults nationwide by the institute for citizens and scholars, 33 percent of respondents indicated no intention to participate civically in 2024;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2022, only 46 percent of Americans could name all three branches of government; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Civic engagement strengthens communities and supports democracy, and civic education helps students develop critical thinking and social skills that are vital to success.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
