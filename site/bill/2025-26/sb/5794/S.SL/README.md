# SB 5794 - Tax preferences

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5794-S.SL.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that, according to the most recent tax exemption study published by the department of revenue, there are currently 786 tax exemptions for the major state and local tax sources in Washington. The exemptions result in nearly $200,000,000,000 of taxpayer savings for the current biennium. The legislature acknowledges that certain tax preferences, such as the sales and use tax exemption for food and the working families tax credit, are intended to rebalance Washington's tax code for working people. However, the legislature further acknowledges that many existing tax preferences are the result of private interests securing preferential tax treatment.

2. For that reason, the legislature enacted robust tax preference performance measures to create greater tax preference transparency and accountability and provide a framework for legislators to make informed decisions on the most efficient use of taxpayer dollars. To ensure tax exemptions meet certain public policy objectives, the joint legislative audit and review committee, a nonpartisan legislative agency, routinely evaluates tax preferences based on specific criteria provided in law and reports that information to the legislature each year. The reports provide accurate, comprehensive, unbiased data that policymakers may use to determine if a tax preference should be continued, modified, or repealed. Additionally, the citizen commission for performance measurement of tax preferences is responsible for selecting which tax preferences are reviewed each year and provides comment on the legislative auditor's reports. Both entities provide recommendations to the legislature on the effectiveness of a tax preference in meeting certain performance measures.

3. Furthermore, the department of revenue assists in the tax preference evaluation process by collecting data from taxpayer beneficiaries and regularly reviewing changes in state and federal law. The analysis by the department and legislative auditor often reveals that a tax exemption is legally obsolete, meaning the specific legal conditions that existed when the exemption was enacted have since changed and the original legislative intent is no longer applicable. Additionally, some tax exemptions are simply not used and should be removed from the tax code to create better clarity for taxpayers.

4. The legislature recognizes that more progress is needed for the state to have a fair and balanced tax system that provides sustainable and ample funding for public schools, health care, and other programs that protect the safety and well-being of the public, as well as social services that provide critical, basic-needs assistance for our state's most vulnerable residents. The legislature further recognizes that the tax preference performance review process provides an opportunity for policymakers to evaluate the tax code to ensure the state is not losing essential revenue due to inefficient or no longer applicable tax exemptions.

5. Thus, the legislature intends to enact recommendations from the joint legislative audit and review committee, the citizen commission for performance measurement of tax preferences, and the department of revenue, including eliminating several obsolete tax preferences, clarifying legislative intent to better inform future tax preference performance reviews, adding expiration dates, and other actions aimed at creating a fair and balanced tax system.

7.

This subsection is limited to premiums and payments for health benefit plans offered by health care service contractors under chapter 48.44 RCW, health maintenance organizations under chapter 48.46 RCW, and self-funded multiple employer welfare arrangements as defined in RCW 48.125.010. The preemption authorized by this subsection must not impair the ability of a county, city, town, or other municipal subdivision to impose excise or privilege taxes upon the health care services directly delivered by the employees of a health maintenance organization under chapter 48.46 RCW.

8. [Empty]

    a. The taxes imposed by this section apply to a self-funded multiple employer welfare arrangement only in the event that they are not preempted by the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1001 et seq. The arrangements and the commissioner must initially request an advisory opinion from the United States department of labor or obtain a declaratory ruling from a federal court on the legality of imposing state premium taxes on these arrangements. Once the legality of the taxes has been determined, the multiple employer welfare arrangement certified by the insurance commissioner must begin payment of these taxes.

    b. If there has not been a final determination of the legality of these taxes, then beginning on the earlier of (i) the date the fourth multiple employer welfare arrangement has been certified by the insurance commissioner, or (ii) April 1, 2006, the arrangement must deposit the taxes imposed by this section into an interest bearing escrow account maintained by the arrangement. Upon a final determination that the taxes are not preempted by the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1001 et seq., all funds in the interest bearing escrow account must be transferred to the state treasurer.

9. The effect of transferring contracts for health care services from one taxpayer to another taxpayer is to transfer the tax prepayment obligation with respect to the contracts.

10. On or before June 1st of each year, the commissioner must notify each taxpayer required to make prepayments in that year of the amount of each prepayment and must provide remittance forms to be used by the taxpayer. However, a taxpayer's responsibility to make prepayments is not affected by failure of the commissioner to send, or the taxpayer to receive, the notice or forms.

    b. This subsection (2) does not apply to transactions for which an application has been submitted for regulatory approval prior to the effective date of this section.

2. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

    a. "Affiliated" means a person that directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another person. For purposes of this subsection (2)(a), "control" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of more than 50 percent of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting shares, by contract, or otherwise.

    b. "Consolidated financial institution group" means all financial institutions that are affiliated with each other.

    c. "Consolidated financial statement" means a consolidated financial institution group's consolidated reports of condition and income filed with the federal financial institutions examination council, or successor agency.

    d. "Financial institution" means:

        i. Any corporation or other business entity chartered under Titles 30A, 30B, 31, 32, and 33 RCW, or registered under the federal bank holding company act of 1956, as amended, or registered as a savings and loan holding company under the federal national housing act, as amended;

        iii. A savings association or federal savings bank as defined in the federal deposit insurance act, 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1813(b)(1);

        iv. Any bank or thrift institution incorporated or organized under the laws of any state;

    v. Any corporation organized under the provisions of 12 U.S.C. Sec. 611 through 631;

    vi. Any agency or branch of a foreign depository as defined in 12 U.S.C. Sec. 3101 ;

    vii. A production credit association organized under the federal farm credit act of 1933, all of whose stock held by the federal production credit corporation has been retired;

    viii. Any corporation or other business entity who receives gross income taxable under RCW 82.04.290, and whose voting interests are more than 50 percent owned, directly or indirectly, by any person or business entity described in (d)(i) through (vii) of this subsection other than an insurance company liable for the insurance premiums tax under RCW 48.14.020 or any other company taxable under chapter 48.14 RCW;

        ix.(A) A corporation or other business entity that receives more than 50 percent of its total gross income for federal income tax purposes from finance leases. For purposes of this subsection, a "finance lease" means a lease that meets two requirements:

(I) It is the type of lease permitted to be made by national banks (see 12 U.S.C. Sec. 24(7) and (10), comptroller of the currency regulations, part 23, leasing (added by 56 C.F.R. Sec. 28314, June 20, 1991, effective July 22, 1991), and regulation Y of the federal reserve system 12 C.F.R. Part 225.25, as amended); and

(II) It is the economic equivalent of an extension of credit, i.e., the lease is treated by the lessor as a loan for federal income tax purposes. In no event does a lease qualify as an extension of credit where the lessor takes depreciation on such property for federal income tax purposes.

(B) For this classification to apply, the average of the gross income in the current tax year and immediately preceding two tax years must satisfy the more than 50 percent requirement;

    x. Any other person or business entity, other than an insurance general agent taxable under RCW 82.04.280(1)(e), an insurance business exempt from the business and occupation tax under RCW 82.04.320, a real estate broker taxable under RCW 82.04.255, a securities dealer or international investment management company taxable under RCW 82.04.290(2), that receives more than 50 percent of its gross receipts from activities that a person described in (d)(ii) through (vii) and (ix) of this subsection is authorized to transact.

        i. "Specified financial institution" means a financial institution that is a member of a consolidated financial institution group that reported on its consolidated financial statement for the previous calendar year annual net income of at least $1,000,000,000, not including net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, as the terms "net income" and "noncontrolling interest" are used in the consolidated financial statement.

        ii. If financial institutions are no longer required to file consolidated financial statements, "specified financial institution" means any person that was subject to the additional tax in this section in at least two of the previous four calendar years.

3. The department must notify the fiscal committees of the legislature if financial institutions are no longer required to file consolidated financial statements.

4. To aid in the effective administration of the additional tax imposed in this section, the department may require a person believed to be a specified financial institution to disclose whether it is a member of a consolidated financial institution group and, if so, to identify all other members of its consolidated financial institution group. A person failing to comply with this subsection is deemed to have intended to evade tax payable under this section and is subject to the penalty in RCW 82.32.090(7) on any tax due under this section by the person and any financial institution affiliated with the person.

5. Taxes collected under this section must be deposited into the general fund.
