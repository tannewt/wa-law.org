<li>
<p>Beginning July 1, 2022, through June 30, 2033, an administrator of a community solar project meeting the eligibility requirements described in this section and RCW 82.16.170(3) may submit an application to the Washington State University extension energy program to receive a precertification for a community solar project. Projects with precertification applications approved by the Washington State University extension energy program have two years to complete their projects and apply for certification. Projects that have not completed certification within two years may apply to the Washington State University extension energy program for an extension of their precertification status for an additional 180 days if they can demonstrate significant progress during the time they were in precertification status. By certifying qualified projects pursuant to the requirements of this section and RCW 82.16.170(3), the Washington State University extension energy program authorizes the utility serving the site of a community solar project in the state of Washington to remit  low-income community solar incentive payments to the community solar project administrator, who accepts the payments on behalf of, and for the purpose of providing direct benefits to, the project's qualifying subscribers. The Washington State University extension energy program may provide incentive payments prior to project certification in accordance with subsection (4) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, a low-income community solar incentive payment remitted to a community solar project administrator for a project certified under this section equals the sum of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>An amount, not to exceed $20,000 per community solar project, equal to the community solar project's administrative costs related to the administrative start-up of the project for qualifying subscribers; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An amount that does not exceed 100 percent of the proportional cost of the installed cost of the share of the community solar project that provides direct benefits to qualifying subscribers, taking into account any federal tax credits or other federal or nonfederal grants or incentives that the program is benefiting from.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the administrator is a utility that is purchasing energy from a community solar project that it does not own, a low-income community solar incentive payment remitted to the utility administrator for a project certified under this section equals: The cost for the utility to purchase power and the corresponding renewable energy credits from a third-party owned community solar project, under a power purchase agreement, for 10 years after project certification for the portion of the project's energy output that will provide direct benefits to qualifying subscribers over those 10 years, or until such time as funding has been fully distributed, whichever comes later. All renewable energy credits must be retired on behalf of program participants or participants must be compensated for additional value from renewable energy credits. The incentives under this subsection can only be used to pay for low-income customer participation in the program. Utilities receiving incentives under this subsection may not earn a rate of return on incentives certified by the Washington State University extension energy program.</p>

<p>Incentive payments provided under this subsection must be issued as follows:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>An incentive payment shall be made for 50 percent of project costs as identified in RCW 82.16.170(3)(g) upon precertification by the Washington State University extension energy program;</p>

<li>
<p>An incentive payment for all remaining costs shall be made upon final certification by the Washington State University extension energy program;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) A project administrator may adjust cost estimates provided under RCW 82.16.170(3)(g) by providing evidence of unavoidable cost increases prior to certification.</p>
<p>(B) The Washington State University extension energy program may approve, reject, or approve partial additional costs submitted for recovery by a community solar project administrator.</p>
<p>(C) Costs identified and approved during precertification may not be rejected unless the Washington State University extension energy program determines there have been material changes to the project design that eliminate the need for such costs.</p>
<pre><code>c. Incentive payments authorized by the Washington State University extension energy program and remitted prior to project certification shall be deducted from the amount the utility is provided to pay to the project administrator after project certification.

d. In the event that a project receiving incentive payment prior to certification does not achieve certification within two years, achieves certification for a lesser incentive amount than what has already been disbursed, or fails to provide direct benefits to the share of qualifying subscribers used to calculate the incentive payment, it is the responsibility of the administrator to remit funding back to the Washington State University extension energy program. After being notified by the Washington State University extension energy program that they are required to do so, the administrator must within 30 days remit a payment to the state for the full amount of the incentive payment received under precertification with interest. Interest must be assessed at the rate provided for delinquent excise taxes under chapter 82.32 RCW, retroactively to the date the credit was claimed, and accrues until the full amount of all amounts due are repaid.

</li>
<li>
<p>For all other community solar projects for which the administrator is not a utility, compensation paid to the interconnection customer must be determined in a written agreement between the interconnection customer and the utility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For all other community solar projects for which the administrator is a utility, compensation must be provided directly to subscribers in accordance with subsection (10)(a)(i) of this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>iv.(A) When the administrator of a community solar project receives compensation for the generation of electricity from a participating utility, interconnection customer, or from the retail electric customer that is the host for the community solar project, the administrator must provide all of that compensation as a direct benefit to the project subscribers, except as described in (iv)(B) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(B) An administrator may deduct ongoing administrative and maintenance costs from compensation they provide to subscribers from power generation, provided those costs are identified in the subscription agreement and approved by the Washington State University extension energy program. The Washington State University extension energy program shall review any such administrative and maintenance costs justifications for reasonableness and approve, reject, or negotiate changes to the proposal. An administrator may request a change in the deduction for administrative and maintenance costs when there is an unplanned maintenance or repair cost if the subscription agreement includes language notifying the subscriber that administrative and maintenance fees are subject to change. If an administrator requests this change, notice must be provided to the subscribers of the fee change and provide a reason for the additional deduction.</p>
<pre><code>b. For 10 years after certification, and by March 1st of each year following certification, the administrator must provide the Washington State University extension energy program with signed statements of the following for the preceding year:

    i. The energy production for the period for which compensation is to be provided;

    ii. Each subscriber's units of the project;

    iii. The amount disbursed to each subscriber for the period. If a utility project administrator administered a community solar project certified under subsection (3) of this section, the utility project administrator must report the amount paid out for low-income customer participation, and the remaining balance of the Washington State University extension energy program's authorized incentive payment; and

    iv. The date and amount disbursed to each subscriber.

c. Starting in fiscal year 2026, the Washington State University extension energy program must provide a report every even-numbered year to the legislature. The report must include the number of projects certified, number of subscribers per project, and total benefits resulting from all projects.

<p>The Washington State University extension energy program must attempt to equitably distribute incentive funds throughout the state. Considerations for equitable fund distribution, based on precertification applications received from administrators served by utilities voluntarily participating in the program, may include measures to reserve or allocate available funds based on the proportion of public utility taxes collected, the proportion of the state's low-income customers served by each utility based on low-income home energy assistance program data at the department of commerce, measures to achieve an equitable geographic distribution of community solar installations and a diversity of administrative models for community solar projects, and the amount of energy burden reduction for qualifying subscribers relative to the project's cost. If an equitable distribution of funds is not feasible due to a lack of precertification applications, the Washington State University extension energy program may allocate funds based on (a) of this subsection on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Washington State University extension energy program must ensure that at least $2,000,000 of the statewide total for the entire program is used to support nonprofit organizations' innovative approaches to allocating benefits to subscribers, defining and valuing benefits to be provided to subscribers or other aspects of the subscriber, administrator, system host, and utility relationship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Washington State University extension energy program must also ensure that at least $2,000,000 of the statewide total for the entire program is available to tribal governments and their designated subdivisions and agencies.</p>
