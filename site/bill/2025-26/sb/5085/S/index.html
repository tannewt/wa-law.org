<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the funding for three of its closed retirement plans has become lopsided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>In 1969, the state merged local police and fire retirement plans because too many of those plans were insolvent, or soon to be insolvent. An estimate conducted by the legislature that year concluded the combined systems were underfunded by around $400,000,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite being merged into the law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system (later designated as plan 1 of that system), within seven years the legislature determined that the funding structure for the merged plan was also unsustainable, and closed the plan to new members on September 30, 1977.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Though the members and employers each paid a fixed six percent of each employee's pay, the total amount was insufficient to pay the cost of benefits for plan members, and the state paid the remainder of the cost. At its highest level, the state paid more than eight times the nonstate employer and member contributions combined in one year alone. Over time, this contributed to the plan having more assets than is required to fund the members' benefits, and the legislature allowed the members and employers to stop making contributions to the plan beginning June 30, 2000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As of June 30, 2023, the law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system plan 1 is 149 percent funded despite including benefits like a fully indexed cost-of-living adjustment. In fact, the plan is so well funded that in 2022, the legislature granted all benefit recipients a one-time lump sum payment equal to $100 per service credit month, with a minimum of $20,000 for any members who retired with a line of duty disability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The history of the teachers' retirement system plan 1 and the public employees' retirement system plan 1 may look similar at first because in most years members and employers each paid a fixed six percent of each employee's pay (with a reduction to the employer rates circa 2002-2007), and this amount was insufficient to pay the liabilities of the plan. However, unlike the law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system plan 1, these plans have had unfunded liabilities for decades. Beginning in 1989, the legislature created an additional contribution rate (colloquially called the &quot;UAAL Rate&quot;) directly aimed at paying off this deficit, and bringing both plans up to full funding. This additional contribution rate has been paid exclusively by the employers and the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As of June 30, 2023, the teachers' retirement system plan 1 is 86 percent funded, and the public employees' retirement system plan 1 is 80 percent funded. Neither plan provides an ongoing cost-of-living adjustment unless an individual's benefits are small enough to qualify for minimum benefit increases.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that, so long as member benefits are protected, it is an appropriate use of law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system plan 1 excess funds (particularly state funds and investment returns resulting from those funds) to improve the funded status of the teachers' retirement system plan 1 and the public employees' retirement system plan 1 via a plan merger. To quote the state supreme court, &quot;[A] defined benefit plan entitles the members to a predetermined distribution upon retirement and to an actuarially sound plan to ensure that the plan is adequately funded to meet those distribution requirements. It does not entitle them to any use of the contributions other than to ensure the above entitlements are met.&quot; Retired Pub. Emples. Council of Wash. v. Charles, 148 Wn.2d 602, 616; quoting Koster v. City of Davenport, 183 F.3d 762, 767.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that a merger would be beneficial to the law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system plan 1 since that plan has no practical funding source. More specifically, current law calls for no contributions to the plan so long as the plan is fully funded. However, if the plan drops below full funding, current law calls for contributions based on a fixed six percent of active employee pay, and there are only seven active employees remaining in the system as of June 30, 2023. This means that in the case of sufficiently unfavorable economic conditions, an unfunded liability could appear in that plan with no method of paying it off except to rely on pay-as-you-go payments from the general fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus, the legislature finds that a merger of these three plans would:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Immediately improve the funded status of both the public employees' retirement system plan 1 and the teachers' retirement system plan 1;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide an ongoing funding source for the law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system plan 1 in case an unfunded actuarial accrued liability emerges in the future, while simultaneously exempting employers of law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system plan 1 members from any future contributions to the plan; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase parity in cost-of-living adjustment policy across the closed plans 1 by providing the members of the public employees' retirement system plan 1 and the teachers' retirement system plan 1 with new and ongoing cost-of-living adjustments.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-102">Section 102 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-102">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature intends to immediately improve the funded status of the teachers' retirement system plan 1 and the public employees' retirement system plan 1 while reiterating its commitment to the on-going funding required to secure benefits promised to members of the law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system plan 1. The legislature intends to accomplish this goal by merging the assets, liabilities, and membership of the three plans. The resulting merged plan will have three tiers of benefits representing each of the plans being merged.</p>
<p>The legislature further intends that this merger, as well as any administrative changes necessary to implement the merger, be accomplished in a way that does not negatively impact benefits provided.</p>
<p>To fully ensure the protection of benefits, the legislature intends for the following to be accomplished by this act:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Members of the law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system plan 1 tier of the merged plan will receive the same benefits from the merged plan as they would have received from their current plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Members of the teachers' retirement system plan 1 tier of the merged plan will receive the same benefits from the merged plan as they would have received from their current plan. The cost-of-living adjustments in sections 401 and 403 of this act are intended as an additional benefit improvement granted on top of existing benefits, and are not intended as a trade-off for any other impact to benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Members of the public employees' retirement system plan 1 tier of the merged plan will receive the same benefits from the merged plan as they would have received from their current plan. The cost-of-living adjustments in sections 402 and 404 of this act are intended as an additional benefit improvement granted on top of existing benefits, and are not intended as a trade-off for any other impact to benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The merger of these three plans will be administered in a way that is consistent with plan qualification requirements in the federal internal revenue code.</p>

<p>It is the policy of the state of Washington to ensure the well-being of its citizens by protecting retirement income to which they are or may become entitled. For that purpose generally and pursuant to the authority granted to the state of Washington under 11 U.S.C. Sec. 522(b)(2), the exemptions in this section relating to retirement benefits are provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise provided by federal law, any money received by any citizen of the state of Washington as a pension from the government of the United States, whether the same be in the actual possession of such person or be deposited or loaned, shall be exempt from execution, attachment, garnishment, or seizure by or under any legal process whatever, and when a debtor dies, or absconds, and leaves his or her family any money exempted by this subsection, the same shall be exempt to the family as provided in this subsection. This subsection shall not apply to child support collection actions issued under chapter 26.18, 26.23, or 74.20A RCW, if otherwise permitted by federal law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The right of a person to a pension, annuity, or retirement allowance or disability allowance, or death benefits, or any optional benefit, or any other right accrued or accruing to any citizen of the state of Washington under any employee benefit plan, and any fund created by such a plan or arrangement, shall be exempt from execution, attachment, garnishment, or seizure by or under any legal process whatever. This subsection shall not apply to child support collection actions issued under chapter 26.18, 26.23, or 74.20A RCW if otherwise permitted by federal law. This subsection shall permit benefits under any such plan or arrangement to be payable to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant in such plan to the extent expressly provided for in a qualified domestic relations order that meets the requirements for such orders under the plan, or, in the case of benefits payable under a plan described in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 403(b) or 408 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, or section 409 of such code as in effect before January 1, 1984, to the extent provided in any order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction that provides for maintenance or support. This subsection does not prohibit actions against an employee benefit plan, or fund for valid obligations incurred by the plan or fund for the benefit of the plan or fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, the term &quot;employee benefit plan&quot; means any plan or arrangement that is described in RCW 49.64.020, including any Keogh plan, whether funded by a trust or by an annuity contract, and in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 401(a) or 403(a) of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended; or that is a tax-sheltered annuity or a custodial account described in section 403(b) of such code or an individual retirement account or an individual retirement annuity described in section 408 of such code; or a Roth individual retirement account described in section 408A of such code; or a medical savings account or a health savings account described in sections 220 and 223, respectively, of such code; or a retirement bond described in section 409 of such code as in effect before January 1, 1984. The term &quot;employee benefit plan&quot; shall not include any employee benefit plan that is established or maintained for its employees by the government of the United States, by the state of Washington under chapter 2.10, 2.12, 41.26, 41.32, 41.34, 41.35, 41.37, 41.40, 41.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 701 of this act), or 43.43 RCW or RCW 41.50.770, or by any agency or instrumentality of the government of the United States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An employee benefit plan shall be deemed to be a spendthrift trust, regardless of the source of funds, the relationship between the trustee or custodian of the plan and the beneficiary, or the ability of the debtor to withdraw or borrow or otherwise become entitled to benefits from the plan before retirement. This subsection shall not apply to child support collection actions issued under chapter 26.18, 26.23, or 74.20A RCW, if otherwise permitted by federal law. This subsection shall permit benefits under any such plan or arrangement to be payable to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant in such plan to the extent expressly provided for in a qualified domestic relations order that meets the requirements for such orders under the plan, or, in the case of benefits payable under a plan described in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 403(b) or 408 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, or section 409 of such code as in effect before January 1, 1984, to the extent provided in any order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction that provides for maintenance or support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless prohibited by federal law, nothing contained in subsection (3), (4), or (5) of this section shall be construed as a termination or limitation of a spouse's community property interest in an employee benefit plan held in the name of or on account of the other spouse, who is the participant or the account holder spouse. Unless prohibited by applicable federal law, at the death of the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse, the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse may transfer or distribute the community property interest of the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse in the participant or account holder spouse's employee benefit plan to the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse's estate, testamentary trust, inter vivos trust, or other successor or successors pursuant to the last will of the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse or the law of intestate succession, and that distributee may, but shall not be required to, obtain an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, including a nonjudicial binding agreement or order entered under chapter 11.96A RCW, to confirm the distribution. For purposes of subsection (3) of this section, the distributee of the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse's community property interest in an employee benefit plan shall be considered a person entitled to the full protection of subsection (3) of this section. The nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse's consent to a beneficiary designation by the participant or account holder spouse with respect to an employee benefit plan shall not, absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, be deemed a release, gift, relinquishment, termination, limitation, or transfer of the nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse's community property interest in an employee benefit plan. For purposes of this subsection, the term &quot;nonparticipant, nonaccount holder spouse&quot; means the spouse of the person who is a participant in an employee benefit plan or in whose name an individual retirement account is maintained. As used in this subsection, an order of a court of competent jurisdiction entered under chapter 11.96A RCW includes an agreement, as that term is used under RCW 11.96A.220.</p>
