<p>The legislative authority of any county may impose an excise tax of up to two percent of the selling price on the retail sale of cannabis concentrates, useable cannabis, and cannabis-infused products. The legislative authority of the county may only impose the tax by ordinance and must condition its imposition on the specific authorization of a majority of the voters voting on a proposition submitted at a special or general election. The ordinance and ballot proposition may provide for the tax to apply for a period of up to seven consecutive years.</p>

<p>If a county has not imposed the excise tax under (a) of this subsection before July 1, 2027, then a city within that county may impose an excise tax of up to two percent of the selling price on the retail sale of cannabis concentrates, useable cannabis, and cannabis-infused products. The legislative authority of the city may only impose the tax by ordinance and must condition its imposition on the specific authorization of a majority of the voters voting on a proposition submitted at a special or general election.

<p>The tax authorized in this section is in addition to any other taxes authorized by law and must be collected from those persons who are taxable by the state under RCW 69.50.535 upon the occurrence of any taxable event within the county or city.</p>
