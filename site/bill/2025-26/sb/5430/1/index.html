<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to provide for the safe, efficient, and reliable transmission and distribution of electric power at affordable rates. Preparation for and response to wildfire risk is an increasingly important element of planning conducted by electric utilities. Proper preparation is crucial to position electric utilities to respond to wildfire risk. Knowing what measures should be taken to minimize wildfire risk before it occurs and to respond to it when it does occur is central to the safe, efficient, and reliable provision of an essential public service. It is essential to make sure these risks are addressed, as needed, but also within appropriate cost parameters to keep electric power affordable to the public. This legislation is designed to direct the prudent use of resources by electric utilities to mitigate and respond to wildfire risk within costs that can be justified as fair, just, and reasonable in order to balance wildfire risk with affordable electric rates.</p>

The company shall update a plan no less frequently than every three years. The company shall provide a copy of its wildfire mitigation plan and updates to the department of natural resources and the utility wildland fire prevention advisory committee created in RCW 76.04.780.</p>

<p>The commission must approve, reject, or approve with conditions, after a public meeting, an electrical company's wildfire mitigation plan or plan update within 60 days of the filing of such plan. The commission shall issue an order approving or approving with conditions the plan or plan update if the commission finds that the plan or plan update is based on reasonable and prudent practices and is designed to meet all appropriate standards adopted or established by rule or order of the commission. The commission may, in approving with conditions the plan or plan update, make modifications to the plan or plan update that the commission reasonably finds represent a reasonable balancing of mitigation costs with the resulting reduction of wildfire risk. The commission shall issue an order explaining any modifications at the time the plan or plan update is approved. In evaluating a plan or plan update, the commission may consult with and consider information from federal, tribal, state, or local governmental entities, utilities, and industry organizations.

</li>
<li>
