# SB 6153 - Senior independent housing

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6153.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that many Washingtonians over 55 years of age choose to live in communities specifically designed for, and marketed to, seniors who wish to live independently in a community of their peers. These senior independent living housing options are often composed of renters or individuals entering into long-term contracts, such as in continuing care retirement communities. As such, residents of these communities are unable to reasonably move should they have a conflict with management.

The legislature finds these seniors do not have access to ombuds services because the long-term care ombuds do not have jurisdiction over senior independent living. As such, the legislature will create senior independent living ombuds who will track data on the types of complaints and identified resolutions and specialize in landlord-tenant and consumer protection advocacy to assist seniors living in these kinds of housing arrangements with issues that may arise.

The legislature further finds that given low supply and high demand for such housing options, statewide data on available senior independent housing units is necessary for public planning purposes, necessitating a statewide database on senior independent housing unit inventory.

Finally, the legislature finds that provisions of the residential landlord-tenant act with respect to tenants who are senior independent housing residents are matters vitally affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act.
