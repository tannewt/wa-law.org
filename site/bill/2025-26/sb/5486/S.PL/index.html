<p>A place of public accommodation that is a motion picture theater shall provide access to fully operational and well–maintained closed captioning technology for the general public for each screening of a motion picture that is produced and available with closed captioning as required by Title III of the federal Americans with disabilities act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a motion picture is produced with open captioning content and distributed to motion picture theaters, a motion picture theater company that controls, operates, owns, or leases five or more motion picture theaters in the state shall provide open captioning screenings of such motion picture that has at least five scheduled screenings at that theater, provided that the theater has digital projection systems that support open captioning files. Such open captioning screenings must occur within each of the time periods set forth below:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Within each of the first two weeks of such a motion picture's release, the motion picture theater shall provide at least two open captioning screenings, of which at least one must begin between 5:59 p.m. and 11:01 p.m. on Fridays or between 10:59 a.m. and 11:01 p.m. on Saturdays or Sundays.</p>

<li>
<p>Within each week after the first two weeks of such a motion picture's release, the motion picture theater shall provide at least one open captioning screening per week, which must begin between 5:59 p.m. and 10:01 p.m. on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays; between 5:59 p.m. and 11:01 p.m. on Fridays; or between 10:59 a.m. and 11:01 p.m. on Saturdays or Sundays.</p>
