<p>A place of public accommodation that controls, operates, owns, or leases a motion picture theater with six or more screens in the state shall, for each motion picture it screens that is produced and available with open captioning, provide open captioning for at least two screenings of the motion picture within each of the first two weeks of the motion picture's release.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>At least one open-captioned screening must take place during peak weekend hours. For purposes of this subsection (2)(a), &quot;peak weekend hours&quot; means between 5:59 p.m. and 11:01 p.m. on Fridays or between 10:59 a.m. and 11:01 p.m. on Saturdays or Sundays.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>A motion picture theater shall advertise the date and time of open-captioned screenings required by this section in the same manner as the motion picture theater advertises all other motion picture screenings and indicate which screenings will include open captioning.</p>

If the motion picture theater demonstrates compliance within the 30-day period, the fine may not be assessed and the violation must be dismissed. Any subsequent violation results in a civil fine of up to $500.</p>
</li>
