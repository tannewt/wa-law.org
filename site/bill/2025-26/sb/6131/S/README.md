## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Bicyclist fatality" means any death of a bicyclist resulting from a collision, whether on a roadway, at an intersection, along an adjacent sidewalk, or on a path that is contiguous with a roadway.

2. "Commission" means the Washington traffic safety commission.

3. "Council" means the Cooper Jones active transportation safety council.

4. "Fatality review committee" means a group of subject matter experts and other members recruited and assembled by the commission based upon their traffic safety experience to review incidents involving the death of a person in Washington resulting from a collision involving a motor vehicle, whether on a roadway, at an intersection, along an adjacent sidewalk, or on a path that is contiguous with a roadway.

5. "Motorist" means anyone using the transportation system who is using a motor vehicle as a driver or passenger.

6. "Nonmotorist" means anyone using the transportation system who is not in a vehicle.

7. "Pedestrian fatality" means any death of a pedestrian resulting from a collision, whether on a roadway, at an intersection, along an adjacent sidewalk, or on a path that is contiguous with a roadway.

8. "Public health authority" has the same meaning as defined in 45 C.F.R. Part 164, as it existed on the effective date of this section, or such subsequent date as may be provided by the commission by rule, consistent with the purposes of this chapter.

9. "Serious injury" means any injury other than a fatal injury that prevents the injured person from walking, driving, or normally continuing the activities the person was capable of performing before the injury occurred.

## Section 3
1. The  Washington traffic safety commission is established as a public health authority. The functions and purpose of this commission shall be to identify contributing factors that most commonly lead to motor vehicle collisions that result in death or serious injury; to plan and supervise programs for the prevention of collisions on streets and highways including but not limited to educational campaigns designed to reduce traffic crashes in cooperation with all official and unofficial organizations interested in traffic safety; to coordinate the activities at the state and local level in the development of statewide and local traffic safety programs; to promote a uniform enforcement of traffic safety laws and establish standards for investigation and reporting of traffic collisions; to promote and improve driver education; and to authorize the governor to perform all functions required to be performed by him or her under the federal Highway Safety Act of 1966 (Public Law 89-564; 80 Stat. 731) in order to promote and protect public health and safety.

2. The legislature finds and declares that bicycling and walking are becoming increasingly popular in Washington as clean and efficient modes of transportation, as recreational activities, and as organized sports. Future plans for the state's transportation system will require increased access and safety for bicycles and pedestrians on our common roadways, and federal transportation legislation and funding programs have created strong incentives to implement these changes quickly. As a result, many more people are likely to take up bicycling in Washington both as a leisure activity and as a convenient, inexpensive form of transportation. Bicyclists are more vulnerable to serious injury during collisions than motorists, and should be as knowledgeable as possible about traffic laws, be highly visible and predictable when riding in traffic, and be encouraged to wear bicycle safety helmets. Hundreds of bicyclists and pedestrians are seriously injured every year in collisions, and millions of dollars are spent on health care costs associated with these collisions. There is clear evidence that organized training in the rules and techniques of safe and effective cycling can significantly reduce the incidence of serious injury and collisions, increase cooperation among road users, and significantly increase the incidence of bicycle helmet use, particularly among minors. A reduction in collisions benefits the entire community. Therefore it is appropriate for businesses and community organizations to provide donations to bicycle and pedestrian safety training programs.

## Section 4
1. In addition to other responsibilities set forth in this chapter the commission shall:

    a. Advise and confer with the governing authority of any political subdivision of the state or federally recognized Indian tribe deemed eligible under the federal Highway Safety Act of 1966 (Public Law 89-564; 80 Stat. 731) for participation in the aims and programs and purposes of that act;

    b. Advise and confer with all agencies of state government whose programs and activities are within the scope of the Highway Safety Act including those agencies that are not subject to direct supervision, administration, and control by the governor under existing laws;

    d. Receive crash reports, toxicology reports, and related investigation information from state or local law enforcement agencies;

    e. Receive driver licensing records from the department of licensing for motor vehicle collisions resulting in a fatality;

    f. In reviewing traffic crashes resulting in the death of a pedestrian, bicyclist, or other active transportation user, include members from the council in the review process and provide a summary of the review results to the council at a regularly scheduled meeting. The number of councilmembers in attendance for the review are limited to less than a quorum of the membership;

    g. Present reports prepared under this section regarding fatal traffic crashes involving the deaths of active transportation users to the council during the calendar year that the review under (f) of this subsection is published; and

    h. Carry out such other responsibilities as may be consistent with this chapter.

2. The commission may:

    a. As a public health authority, collect health care information under RCW 70.02.050(2)(b). Any health care information obtained under this subsection is exempt from public inspection and copying under chapter 42.56 RCW. The health care information may be collected from, but is not limited to, hospitals, emergency medical services, medical examiners, and coroner offices. The commission may compile and link the records data from these sources, store this information in a secure database, and perform statistical and epidemiological analyses to identify causes and trends in traffic fatalities. Such health care information must only be used for the purposes of this chapter, including for anonymized reports on fatal or serious injury collisions and for providing such reports and underlying data to the University of Washington's institute for health metrics and evaluation;

    b. As part of its purpose to identify contributing factors contributing to fatal and serious injury collisions, convene a fatality review committee to review any available information, including: Crash information maintained in existing databases; statutes, rules, policies, or ordinances related to the incidents; and any other relevant information, including reports and records described in this section;

    c. Make recommendations regarding changes in statutes, ordinances, rules, and policies that could improve the safety of all road users, including motor vehicle occupants, motorcyclists, pedestrians, bicyclists, and individuals using personal mobility devices. Additionally, the commission may make recommendations on how to improve traffic fatality and serious injury data quality, including crashes that occur in privately owned property such as parking lots;

    d. Consult with local cities and counties, as well as local police departments and other law enforcement agencies and associations representing those jurisdictions on how to improve data quality regarding crashes;

    e. Obtain and examine medical records related to individuals involved in fatal traffic crashes that occur in Washington including, but not limited to, postmortem medical examinations and emergency medical treatment and trauma care provided after a traffic collision. Medical records may be reviewed by members of the fatality review committee and are subject to the protections described in (a) of this subsection; and

    f. Publish reports summarizing trends, contributing factors, and policy or program recommendations resulting from reviews. Reports may not include personally identifiable information or information with which, in combination with readily available public sources, members of the public could discern personal information.

3. All meetings or deliberations of a fatality review committee are confidential and are not subject to the requirements of chapter 42.30 RCW, the open public meetings act.

4. Discussions among participants of a fatality review committee during fatal crash review proceedings and documents, other than the final report of the committee, prepared by the commission are inadmissible and may not be used in a civil or administrative proceeding, except that any document that exists before its use or consideration in a review by the commission, or that is created independently of such review, does not become inadmissible merely because it is reviewed or used by the commission.

5. For confidential information, including medical records and personal information under RCW 42.56.230 (7) and (9), that is obtained by the commission, neither the commission nor any participant in the fatality review committee may publicly disclose such confidential information. Such confidential information must only be used for the purposes of this chapter. No person who was in attendance at a meeting of the fatality review committee or who participated in the creation, retention, collection, or maintenance of information or documents specifically for the commission or the council shall be permitted to testify in any civil action as to the content of such proceedings or of the documents and information prepared specifically as part of the activities of the council. However, recommendations from the council and the commission generally may be disclosed without personal identifiers.

6. The commission may review, only to the extent otherwise permitted by law or court rule when determined to be relevant and necessary: Any law enforcement incident documentation, such as incident reports, dispatch records, and victim, witness, and suspect statements; any supplemental reports, probable cause statements, and 911 call taker's reports; abstracts of driving records; and any other information determined to be relevant to the review. The commission and the council must maintain the confidentiality of the information to the extent required by any applicable law.

7. If acting in good faith, without malice, and within the parameters of and protocols established under this chapter, representatives of the commission and members of a fatality review committee convened by the commission are immune from civil liability for any activity related to reviews of any particular fatalities and serious injuries.

8. This section does not create a private right of action, except if representatives of the commission and members of a fatality review committee act in bad faith by disclosing confidential information protected under this chapter.

## Section 5
