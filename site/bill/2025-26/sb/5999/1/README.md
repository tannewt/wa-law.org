# SB 5999 - Ecosystem services

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5999.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds it is in the best interest of the trust beneficiaries and the state to increase revenue opportunities, diversify the trust asset portfolio, and reduce costs. As new markets emerge, the department should be enabled to take full advantage of opportunities to diversify and grow revenue streams for beneficiaries and the state.

2. The legislature finds that the trust land performance assessment, completed pursuant to section 7015, chapter 298, Laws of 2018, recommends exploring opportunities to diversify funding streams for revenue generation, including utilizing carbon markets, as well as other ways to monetize ecosystem services for the beneficiaries and the state. The legislature further finds that the climate commitment act, which established a cap and invest program under chapter 70A.65 RCW, makes Washington state a leader in climate policy and, through the codification of carbon offset projects, creates a new way for revenue to be generated from lands and waters in the state. The legislature intends that the carbon offset projects established for this program benefit the people of Washington by being located on Washington lands and waters to the extent possible, rather than outside the state.

3. The legislature finds that as the manager of approximately 6,000,000 acres of lands and waters, the department is well-suited to take actions that increase carbon sequestration and storage, generate revenue from those actions through carbon offset projects, and provide additional benefits including reforestation, forest health restoration, afforestation, air and water purification, habitat creation, temperature regulation, stormwater management, and disaster mitigation.

4. The legislature further finds that private landowners are leading the way by entering carbon markets and that the department should have similar authority as private landowners to enter carbon markets to generate revenue and reduce costs for beneficiaries and the state. For these reasons, the legislature believes the department should have the same authority to enter carbon markets as private landowners for ecosystem services projects on state lands.

5. The legislature finds that similar opportunities exist in aquatic lands for kelp and eelgrass conservation and restoration projects that reduce conservation and restoration costs to the state and help to generate revenue for aquatic lands enhancement account funds for salmon habitat improvements.

6. Therefore, the legislature intends to establish the direct authority for the department to generate revenue on its lands and waters through payment for ecosystem service projects including, but not limited to, carbon offset projects. Accordingly, the legislature intends to provide the department the necessary authority to create carbon offset and ecosystem services projects under the cap and invest program and other regulatory and voluntary ecosystem service market places.

4. The department shall consult with affected interest groups in implementing this section.

5. Any project designed to address the restoration of Puget Sound may be funded under this chapter only if the project is not in conflict with the action agenda developed by the Puget Sound partnership under RCW 90.71.310.
