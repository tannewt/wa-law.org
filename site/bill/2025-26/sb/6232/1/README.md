# SB 6232 - Mental health counselors

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6232.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. The licensed mental health counseling profession has distinct educational requirements, practice standards, ethical considerations, and scope of practice that warrant specialized governance.

    b. Licensed mental health counselors play a crucial role in providing mental health services to Washington state residents, and the profession has grown significantly in scope, complexity, and public impact.

    c. The establishment of an independent licensing board will provide stronger professional oversight, more targeted regulatory focus, and enhanced public protection specifically related to mental health counseling practice.

    d. An independent board will enhance the profession's ability to respond promptly and effectively to evolving practice standards, emerging ethical issues, and public protection needs.

    e. As Washington prepares to adopt the counseling compact, an independent licensing board becomes necessary to manage the state's regulatory duties under the compact. A licensing board provides the authority, infrastructure, and accountability needed to evaluate and grant practice privileges, set and enforce standards, and oversee compact practitioners practicing in Washington. Moving to a licensing board model ensures consistent regulation, facilitates effective participation in the compact, and enhances consumer protection within an expanded interstate practice environment.

    f. Professional self-regulation through an independent licensing board improves accountability, encourages professional excellence, and guarantees that regulatory decisions are based on current practice standards and clinical expertise.

    g. The creation of an independent licensing board aligns with the regulatory structure of other health care professions in Washington state and demonstrates the maturity and independence of the mental health counseling profession.

2. The legislature intends to establish the board of licensing of licensed mental health counselors to improve public safety, strengthen professional oversight, support the ongoing growth of high-quality mental health counseling in Washington, and ensure that mental health services meet the highest standards of safety, ethics, and clinical skill.
