<p>To carry out the purposes for which ferry districts are created, the governing body of a ferry district may levy each year an ad valorem tax on all taxable property located in the district not to exceed 75 cents per thousand dollars of assessed value, except a ferry district in a county with a population of 1,500,000 or more may not levy at a rate that exceeds seven and one-half cents per $1,000 of assessed value. The levy must be sufficient for the provision of ferry services as shown to be required by the budget prepared by the governing body of the ferry district.</p>

<li>
<p>A tax imposed under this section may be used only for:</p>
<ol type="a">
