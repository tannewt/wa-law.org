# SB 6314 - Firearm manufacturing

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6314.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds the production of undetectable and untraceable firearms and firearm components through three-dimensional printing and computer numerical control (CNC) milling presents a growing threat to public safety. The legislature further finds the production of firearms by unlicensed manufacturers allows prohibited individuals to evade background checks and obtain firearms they could not otherwise lawfully obtain. The legislature intends to address these problems by strengthening the state's existing firearms laws.

## Section 2
Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter.

## Section 3
Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter.
