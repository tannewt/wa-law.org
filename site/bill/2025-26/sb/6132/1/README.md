    a. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, a port district may at any time contract indebtedness or borrow money for district purposes and may issue general obligation bonds therefor not exceeding an amount, together with any existing indebtedness of the district not authorized by the voters, of one-fourth of one percent of the value of the taxable property in the district.

Prior to contracting for any indebtedness authorized by this subsection (1)(b), the port district must have a comprehensive plan for harbor improvements or industrial development and a long-term financial plan approved by the department of commerce. The department of commerce is immune from any liability for its part in reviewing or approving port district's improvement or development plans, or financial plans.

2. With the assent of three-fifths of the voters voting thereon at a general or special port election called for that purpose, a port district may contract indebtedness or borrow money for district purposes and may issue general obligation bonds therefor provided the total indebtedness of the district at any such time shall not exceed three-fourths of one percent of the value of the taxable property in the district.

3. In addition to the indebtedness authorized under subsections (1) and (2) of this section, port districts having less than two hundred million dollars in value of taxable property and operating a municipal airport may at any time contract indebtedness or borrow money for airport capital improvement purposes and may issue general obligation bonds therefor not exceeding an additional one-eighth of one percent of the value of the taxable property in the district without authorization by the voters; and, with the assent of three-fifths of the voters voting thereon at a general or special port election called for that purpose, may contract indebtedness or borrow money for airport capital improvement purposes and may issue general obligation bonds therefor for an additional three-eighths of one percent provided the total indebtedness of the district for all port purposes at any such time shall not exceed one and one-fourth percent of the value of the taxable property in the district.

4. [Empty]

    a. In addition to the indebtedness authorized under subsections (1) through (3) of this section, a port district that meets the requirements in (b) of this subsection (4) may at any time contract indebtedness or borrow money for district purposes and may issue general obligation bonds therefor not exceeding an additional 0.25 percent of the value of the taxable property in the district without authorization by the voters.

        ii. The estimated taxable assessed value within the port district is between $6,000,000,000 and $7,000,000,000 in the calendar year in which the resolution or ordinance establishing the increment area is adopted;

        iii.
