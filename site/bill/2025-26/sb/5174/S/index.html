<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that wood burning stoves are an economical and appealing source of home heating and that it has a duty to protect public health and the environment by minimizing air pollution. In 2015, the United States environmental protection agency established new air quality standards for certain wood burning devices, setting a compliance date for step two of the standards of May 15, 2020. Washington's laws regulating certain devices, as of May 15, 2020, are weaker than those put in place by the environmental protection agency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that a 2021 report by the Northeast states for coordinated air use management, a nonprofit association of eight state air quality agencies, found that the environmental protection agency's certification program to verify that new wood burning devices meet clean air requirements was unreliable and allowed devices that did not meet the requirements to enter the market, putting public health and the environment at risk. Similarly, a 2024 report by the United States office of the inspector general found that the environmental protection agency failed to properly oversee and administer the wood heater program and as a result, wood burning devices that do not meet clean air act standards may be offered for sale unbeknownst to consumers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Protect public health and the environment by aligning state standards for emissions with existing federal standards, where federal standards are more stringent;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protect consumers from woodstoves improperly certified by the environmental protection agency by creating a voluntary state wood burning device verification program; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support voluntary verification by allowing the department of ecology to add voluntary verification as a criterion in determining which stoves qualify for regional wood stove change-out programs and the wood smoke reduction grant program.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout RCW 70A.15.3510 through 70A.15.3620:</p>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<p>No wood burning device shall be installed in new or existing buildings unless such device meets the applicable emission standards adopted by the department under RCW 70A.15.3530.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>By July 1, 1992, the state building code council shall adopt rules requiring an adequate source of heat other than woodstoves in all new and substantially remodeled residential and commercial construction. This rule shall apply (a) to areas designated by a county to be an urban growth area under chapter 36.70A RCW; and (b) to areas designated by the environmental protection agency as being in nonattainment for particulate matter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section, &quot;substantially remodeled&quot; means any alteration or restoration of a building exceeding 60 percent of the appraised value of such building within a 12-month period.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>The department</li>
</ol>
<p>must adopt rules establishing statewide emission performance standards for new wood burning devices in accordance with this section, which may include adopting rules to:</p>
<pre><code>a. Implement the federal emission standards for new residential wood heaters in 40 C.F.R. Part 60, subpart AAA (2025);

b. Implement the federal emission standards for new residential forced-air furnaces and new residential hydronic heaters in 40 C.F.R. Part 60, subpart QQQQ (2025); and

c. Establish and implement emission standards for masonry heaters if the United States environmental protection agency adopts such standards.

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Except as provided in (b) of this subsection and subsection (8) of this section, if a federal emission standard applies to a particular wood burning device as of January 1, 2025, the applicable statewide emission standards adopted by the department under this section must be consistent with the federal emission standards adopted by the United States environmental protection agency, as it existed on January 1, 2025.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may amend the rules to maintain consistency with the emission performance standards adopted by the United States environmental protection agency. If the United States environmental protection agency adopts federal emission standards that are less stringent than those in existence on January 1, 2025, the department must retain the more stringent statewide emission standards.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter which allows an authority to adopt more stringent emission standards, no authority shall adopt any emission standard for new wood burning devices other than the statewide standard adopted by the department under this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>4.No wood burning device shall be offered for sale in this state to residents of this state that does not meet the statewide emission performance standards adopted by the department under this section, using only the applicable test methodology adopted by the United States environmental protection agency. For the purposes of this subsection (4), &quot;wood burning device&quot; does not include a fireplace.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>After January 1, 1997, no fireplace, except masonry fireplaces, shall be offered for sale unless such fireplace meets the 1990 United States environmental protection agency standards for woodstoves or equivalent standard that may be established by the state building code council by rule. Prior to January 1, 1997, the state building code council shall establish by rule a methodology for the testing of factory-built fireplaces. The methodology shall be designed to achieve a particulate air emission standard equivalent to the 1990 United States environmental protection agency standard for woodstoves. In developing the rules, the council shall include on the technical advisory committee at least one representative from the masonry fireplace builders and at least one representative of the factory-built fireplace manufacturers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to January 1, 1997, the state building code council shall establish by rule design standards for the construction of new masonry fireplaces in Washington state. In developing the rules, the council shall include on the technical advisory committee at least one representative from the masonry fireplace builders and at least one representative of the factory-built fireplace manufacturers. It shall be the goal of the council to develop design standards that generally achieve reductions in particulate air contaminant emissions commensurate with the reductions being achieved by factory-built fireplaces at the time the standard is established.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actions of the department and local air pollution control authorities under this section shall preempt actions of other state agencies and local governments for the purposes of controlling air pollution from wood burning devices, except where authorized by chapter 199, Laws of 1991.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For wood burning devices for which the United States environmental protection agency has not established emission standards, the department may exempt or establish, by rule, statewide standards including emission levels and test procedures for such devices .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must establish, by rule, a program to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Determine whether a new wood burning device complies with the statewide emission  standards adopted under this section; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Publish a list of devices that comply with the statewide emission  standards.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Subject to amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the department must administer a voluntary program to verify that a wood burning device certified by the United States environmental protection agency complies with emission standards adopted by the department under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To participate in the program, a wood stove manufacturer must submit its United States environmental protection agency required air quality compliance documentation to the department for review. Upon review of the documentation, the department must evaluate whether the device meets emission standards and therefore, was property certified by the United States environmental protection agency.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If the department finds that the device meets emission standards, the department must notify the manufacturer. The department may also publish notice on its website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the department finds that the device does not meet emission standards, the department may provide technical support to a manufacturer to help address deficiencies. The department must deny verification until the manufacturer has sufficiently addressed all deficiencies.</p>
