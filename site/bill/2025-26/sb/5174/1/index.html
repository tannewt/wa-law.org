<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout RCW 70A.15.3510 through 70A.15.3620:</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>No wood burning device shall be installed in new or existing buildings unless such device meets the applicable emission standard and certification requirements adopted by the department under this section. The department may adopt by rule additional certification procedures for wood burning devices to ensure compliance with the adopted emission standard. The department may also adopt by rule emission standards and other requirements for residential home heating devices burning solid fuels other than wood or pellet fuel, including devices burning coal and other nongaseous and nonliquid fuels.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>By July 1, 1992, the state building code council shall adopt rules requiring an adequate source of heat other than woodstoves in all new and substantially remodeled residential and commercial construction. This rule shall apply (a) to areas designated by a county to be an urban growth area under chapter 36.70A RCW; and (b) to areas designated by the environmental protection agency as being in nonattainment for particulate matter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section, &quot;substantially remodeled&quot; means any alteration or restoration of a building exceeding 60 percent of the appraised value of such building within a 12-month period.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<p>The department of ecology shall establish by rule under chapter 34.05 RCW:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Statewide emission performance standards for new wood burning devices. The department may adopt rules to implement the federal emission standards for new residential wood heaters in 40 C.F.R. Part 60, subpart AAA (2025), and to implement the federal emission standards for new residential forced-air furnaces and new residential hydronic heaters in 40 C.F.R. Part 60, subpart QQQQ (2025). The department may also adopt rules to establish and implement emission standards for masonry heaters, which may include incorporation of federal emission standards adopted by the United States environmental protection agency. If the department adopts rules as authorized in this section, the department shall adopt the emission performance standards as they exist on January 1, 2025. The department may amend the rules from time to time to maintain consistency with the emission performance standards adopted by the United States environmental protection agency unless the department finds that the requirements adopted by the United States environmental protection agency are less stringent than those in effect under this section or that the changes would adversely impact air quality. The department may adopt by rule a sell-through provision allowing retailers to sell United States environmental protection agency-certified wood burning devices in their inventory for up to 12 months after a device is removed from the department's certification list. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter which allows an authority to adopt more stringent emission standards, no authority shall adopt any emission standard for new wood burning devices other than the statewide standard adopted by the department under this section.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>No wood burning device shall be offered for sale in this state to residents of this state that does not meet the statewide emission performance standards adopted by the department under this section, using an applicable test methodology adopted by the United States environmental protection agency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After January 1, 1997, no fireplace, except masonry fireplaces, shall be offered for sale unless such fireplace meets the 1990 United States environmental protection agency standards for woodstoves or equivalent standard that may be established by the state building code council by rule. Prior to January 1, 1997, the state building code council shall establish by rule a methodology for the testing of factory-built fireplaces. The methodology shall be designed to achieve a particulate air emission standard equivalent to the 1990 United States environmental protection agency standard for woodstoves. In developing the rules, the council shall include on the technical advisory committee at least one representative from the masonry fireplace builders and at least one representative of the factory-built fireplace manufacturers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to January 1, 1997, the state building code council shall establish by rule design standards for the construction of new masonry fireplaces in Washington state. In developing the rules, the council shall include on the technical advisory committee at least one representative from the masonry fireplace builders and at least one representative of the factory-built fireplace manufacturers. It shall be the goal of the council to develop design standards that generally achieve reductions in particulate air contaminant emissions commensurate with the reductions being achieved by factory-built fireplaces at the time the standard is established.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actions of the department and local air pollution control authorities under this section shall preempt actions of other state agencies and local governments for the purposes of controlling air pollution from wood burning devices, except where authorized by chapter 199, Laws of 1991.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsection (1)(a) of this section shall not apply to fireplaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For wood burning devices for which the United States environmental protection agency has not established emission standards, the department may exempt or establish, by rule, statewide standards including emission levels and test procedures for such devices .</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A program to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Determine whether a new wood burning device complies with the statewide emission performance standards and certification requirements adopted under subsection (1) of this section; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Publish a list of devices that comply with the statewide emission performance standards and certification requirements.</p>
