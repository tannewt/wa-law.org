<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Access to health care is fundamental to the health and safety of Washington state residents;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health insurance coverage is necessary for most people to access health care;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uncertainty in the health insurance marketplace is significantly impacted by the volatility in the federal legislative and regulatory environment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rising health care costs are impacting access and affordability for Washington state residents;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An unstable and volatile individual insurance market would be catastrophic and lead to:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Deteriorating health outcomes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Declining work force productivity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lower quality of life; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased burdens on safety net providers from the rising demand for uncompensated care;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each year, the Washington health benefit exchange board uses 19 basic criteria that were established in the affordable care act to review and certify health plans that will be offered to Washington state residents in the exchange market;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These 19 basic criteria do not address access and affordability issues in the exchange market; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The affordable care act authorizes state exchanges to ensure that certified health plans are in the interest of the residents of the state by adopting additional health plan certification criteria to that effect. Access to and affordability of certified health plans are in the interest of residents of the state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to authorize the Washington health benefit exchange to add criteria in the health plan certification process to address access and affordability issues impacting residents who purchase health insurance coverage on the exchange market and help reduce volatility in the exchange market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, the legislature recognizes that the office of the insurance commissioner has the primary responsibility to review and approve a health carrier's:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Proposed rate increases to ensure that any rate increases are reasonable, actuarially sound, nondiscriminatory, and comply with federal and state law; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provider networks to ensure adequate access to services.</p>

<p>Members of the board are not civilly or criminally liable and may not have any penalty or cause of action of any nature arise against them for any action taken or not taken, including any discretionary decision or failure to make a discretionary decision, when the action or inaction is done in good faith and in the performance of the powers and duties under chapter 317, Laws of 2011. Nothing in this section prohibits legal actions against the board to enforce the board's statutory or contractual duties or obligations.</p>

<p>Each year, after the board has reviewed and certified health plans to be offered on the exchange market in the following plan year, the exchange shall review market conditions and identify access and affordability issues in the exchange market that impact the next plan year for which the exchange has not yet certified plans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each year, the exchange may adopt market factor certification criteria for the next plan year to address market conditions that impact access to and affordability of qualified health plans for individuals or employers who are eligible to purchase coverage on the exchange market in Washington state.
