[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6037-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. As an alternative to the petition method of formation for fire protection districts provided in this chapter, the legislative authority of a city or town may by resolution, subject to the approval of the voters, establish a fire protection district with boundaries that are the same as the corporate boundaries of the city or town for the provision of fire prevention services, fire suppression services, and emergency medical services, and for the protection of life and property within the city or town.

    a. Any resolution adopted by a city or town under this section to establish a fire protection district must, at a minimum:

        i. Contain a financing plan for the fire protection district. As part of the financing plan, the city or town may propose the imposition of revenue sources authorized by this title for fire protection districts, such as property taxes, as provided in chapter 52.16 RCW, or benefit charges, as provided in chapter 52.18 RCW; and

        ii. Set a date for a public hearing on the resolution.

    b. The financing plan in the resolution adopted by the city or town must contain the following information regarding property taxes that will be imposed by the fire protection district and city or town subsequent to the formation of the district:

        i. The dollar amount the fire protection district will levy in the first year in which the fire protection district imposes any of the regular property taxes in RCW 52.16.130, 52.16.140, or 52.16.160;

        ii. If the fire protection district is formed prior to July 1, 2026, the city's or town's highest lawful levy for the purposes of RCW 84.55.092, reduced by the fire protection district's levy amount from (b)(i) of this subsection. This reduced highest lawful levy becomes the city's or town's highest lawful levy since 1986 for subsequent levy limit calculations under chapter 84.55 RCW; and

        iii. The estimated aggregate net dollar amount impact on property owners within the city or town based on the levy rate including, if the fire protection district is formed prior to July 1, 2026, the city's or town's levy reduction described in (b)(ii) of this subsection.

    c. If a city or town proposes the initial imposition of a benefit charge as a revenue source for the fire protection district under (a) of this subsection, the resolution adopted by the city or town must comply with the requirements of RCW 52.18.030.

    d. Notice of public hearing on a resolution adopted by a city or town must be published on a city website or local newspaper for three consecutive weeks , and must be posted for at least fifteen days prior to the date of the hearing in three public places within the boundaries of the proposed fire protection district. Additional notice of the hearing may be given by mail, or in any manner the city legislative authorities deem necessary to notify affected persons. All notices must contain the time, date, and place of the public hearing.

2. [Empty]

    a. A resolution adopted under this section is not effective unless approved by the voters of the city or town at a general election. The resolution must be approved:

        i. By a simple majority of the voters of the city or town; or

        ii. If the resolution proposes the initial imposition of a benefit charge, by sixty percent of the voters of the city or town.

    b. An election to approve or reject a resolution forming a fire protection district, including the proposed financial plan and any imposition of revenue sources for the fire protection district, must be conducted by the election officials of the county or counties in which the proposed district is located in accordance with the general election laws of the state. If a resolution forming a fire protection district provides that the fire protection district will be governed by a board of independently elected fire commissioners, as permitted under RCW 52.14.140, then the initial independently elected fire commissioners must be elected at the same election where the resolution is submitted to the voters authorizing the creation of the fire protection district. The election must be held at the next general election date, according to RCW 29A.04.321 and 29A.04.330, occurring after the date of the public hearing on the resolution adopted by the city or town legislative authority. The ballot title must include the information regarding property taxes that is required to be in the financing plan of the resolution under subsection (1)(b) of this section.

    c. If a ballot proposition on the resolution is approved by voters, as provided in (a) of this subsection, the county legislative authority shall by resolution declare the fire protection district organized under the name designated in the ballot proposition.

    d. Nothing contained in this chapter may be construed to alter a municipal airport fire department or affect any powers authorized under RCW 14.08.120. If a question arises as to whether this chapter modifies the affairs of municipal airports in any way, the answer is no.

3. (a) For any fire protection district formed under this section prior to July 1, 2026, a city or town must reduce its general fund regular property tax levy by the total combined levy of the fire protection district as proposed by the district in accordance with subsection (1)(b)(i) of this section. The reduced levy amount of the city or town must occur in the first year in which the fire protection district imposes any of the property taxes in RCW 52.16.130, 52.16.140, or 52.16.160 and must be specified in the financing plan and ballot proposition as provided in this section. If the fire protection district does not impose all three levies under RCW 52.16.130, 52.16.140, and 52.16.160 when it begins operations, the city must further reduce its general fund regular property tax levy if the district initially imposes any of the levies in subsequent years, by the amount of such levy or levies initially imposed in a subsequent year.

    b. For any fire protection district formed under this section on or after July 1, 2026, for the city or town participating in the fire protection district, with the exception of cities over 500,000 in population as of 2025, the regular levies of the city or town may not exceed the applicable rates provided in RCW 27.12.390, 52.04.081, and 84.52.043(1) less the aggregate rates of any regular levies made by the district under RCW 52.16.130, 52.16.140, or 52.16.160.

## Section 2
1. Except as provided otherwise in the resolution adopted by the legislative authority of a city or town establishing a fire protection district under RCW 52.02.160, all powers, duties, and functions of the city or town fire department pertaining to fire protection and emergency services of the city or town are transferred to the fire protection district on its creation date.

3. All rules and all pending business before the city or town fire department pertaining to the fire protection and emergency services powers, functions, and duties transferred must be continued and acted upon by the fire protection district, and all existing contracts and obligations remain in full force and must be performed by the fire protection district.

4. The transfer of powers, duties, functions, and personnel of the city or town fire department do not affect the validity of any act performed before creation of the fire protection district.

5. If apportionments of budgeted funds are required because of the transfers, the treasurer for the city or town fire department must certify the apportionments.

6. [Empty]

    a. Subject to (c) of this subsection, all employees of the city or town fire department are transferred to the fire protection district on its creation date. Upon transfer, unless an agreement for different terms of transfer is reached between the collective bargaining representatives of the transferring employees and the fire protection district, an employee is entitled to the employee rights, benefits, and privileges to which he or she would have been entitled as an employee of the city or town fire department, including rights to:

        i. Compensation at least equal to the level at the time of transfer;

        ii. Retirement, vacation, sick leave, and any other accrued benefit;

        iii. Promotion and service time accrual; and

        iv. The length or terms of probationary periods, including no requirement for an additional probationary period if one had been completed before the transfer date.

    b. If a city or town provides for civil service in its fire department, the collective bargaining representatives of the transferring employees and the fire protection district must negotiate regarding the establishment of a civil service system within the fire protection district.

    c. Nothing contained in this section may be construed to alter any existing collective bargaining unit or the provisions of any existing collective bargaining agreement until the agreement has expired or until the bargaining unit has been modified as provided by law.

## Section 3
1. The regular property tax levy for each taxing district other than the state's levies may be set at the amount which would be allowed otherwise under this chapter if the regular property tax levy for the district for taxes due in prior years beginning with 1986 had been set at the full amount allowed under this chapter including any levy authorized under RCW 52.16.160 or 52.26.140(1)(c) that would have been imposed but for the limitation in RCW 52.18.065 or 52.26.240, applicable upon imposition of the benefit charge under chapter 52.18 or 52.26 RCW.

2. The purpose of subsection (1) of this section is to remove the incentive for a taxing district to maintain its tax levy at the maximum level permitted under this chapter, and to protect the future levy capacity of a taxing district that reduces its tax levy below the level that it otherwise could impose under this chapter, by removing the adverse consequences to future levy capacities resulting from such levy reductions.
