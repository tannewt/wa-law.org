<ol>
<li>
<p>Each agency shall collect voluntary self-identification demographic data using the United States office of management and budget statistical policy directive number 15 as published on March 29, 2024, that provides common language for uniformity and comparability in the collection and use of race and ethnicity data, minimum categories, and corresponding detailed categories and subcategories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each agency must consider and base demographic data collection on the appropriate demographic data set necessary with regard to appropriate target demographic categories or subcategories of a program or agency being evaluated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The data collected under subsection (1) of this section must be included in every demographic report on race or ethnic origin by the state agency, board, or commission published or released after June 30, 2025. The reports must state the reasoning and process used to determine the appropriate data set. If the appropriate data set cannot be collected, the report should state the reasons why. The data must be made available to the public in accordance with state and federal law, except for personal information, which shall be deemed confidential.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>An agency may submit a request to the office of financial management for a variance to the detailed categories if the agency determines that collecting different detailed data categories than the ones listed in United States office of management and budget statistical policy directive number 15 provides more useful or accurate data for the collection's specific context and intended uses. Any variances in detailed data collection must be able to be aggregated up to the required minimum categories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of financial management must review agency requests for exemptions and variances, and only approve the requests if they contain sufficient justification.</p>
