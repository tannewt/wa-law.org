## Section 3
1. Each agency shall collect voluntary self-identification demographic data using the United States office of management and budget statistical policy directive number 15 as published on March 29, 2024, that provides common language for uniformity and comparability in the collection and use of race and ethnicity data, minimum categories, and corresponding detailed categories and subcategories used by the United States census bureau for Washington state population estimates, or other more granular demographic data as the agency may deem appropriate and necessary for its intended purpose.

2. Each agency must consider and base demographic data collection on the appropriate demographic data set necessary with regard to appropriate target demographic categories or subcategories of a program or agency being evaluated.

3. The data collected under subsection (1) of this section must be included in every demographic report on race or ethnic origin by the state agency, board, or commission published or released after June 30, 2030. The reports must state the reasoning and process used to determine the appropriate data set. If the appropriate data set cannot be collected, the report should state the reasons why. The data must be made available to the public in accordance with state and federal law including, but not limited to, the health insurance portability and accountability act and family educational rights and privacy act, and privacy protection standards including, but not limited to, data aggregation and suppression necessary to protect individual identities, and excluding personal information, which shall be deemed confidential.

4. If any questions arise regarding the appropriate racial, ethnic, or cultural categories or subcategories from which data should be collected for any given program, the state ethnic commissions and the governor's office of Indian affairs should be consulted for advice.

5. An agency must comply with the requirements of this section as early as possible following the effective date of this section, but at the latest by June 30, 2030.

## Section 4
1. The office of financial management shall convene and manage a multiagency committee that includes representatives from the state ethnic commissions, the governor's office of Indian affairs, office of equity, and office of privacy and data protection to review and approve requests for exemptions to the requirement to collect more detailed data beyond the minimum categories in statistical policy directive number 15. An agency may submit a request to the multiagency committee for an exemption to the requirement to collect more detailed data beyond the minimum categories if the agency determines that the potential benefit of the detailed data would not justify the additional burden to the agency and the public or the additional risk to privacy or confidentiality.

2. An agency may submit a request to the multiagency committee for a variance to the detailed categories used by the United States census bureau for Washington state if the agency determines that collecting different detailed data categories provides more useful or accurate data for the collection's specific context and intended uses. Any variances in detailed data collection must be able to be aggregated up to the required minimum categories.

3. The multiagency committee must review agency requests for exemptions and variances, and only approve the requests if:

    a. The potential benefit of the detailed data would not justify the additional burden to the agency and the public or the additional risk to individual privacy or confidentiality;

    b. The agency demonstrates that the exemption or variance is appropriate for target demographic categories or subcategories of a program or agency;

    c. The agency is not the primary data collector;

    d. The agency is required to report demographic data to federal agencies using different categories; or

    e. They otherwise contain sufficient justification.

## Section 5
1. Each agency shall develop a multiyear phased plan for implementing the demographic data collection and reporting requirements in section 3 of this act. Agency plans must address:

    a. Technology updates needed for technical implementation;

    b. Statutory and rule changes needed;

    c. Data security and guidelines for reporting that protect individual privacy;

    d. Data governance;

    e. Change management strategies including training and process modifications; and

    f. The staffing, technology, and other costs associated with each of the above plan components.

2. Each agency must submit implementation plans to the multiagency committee by December 1, 2026, and the multiagency committee must submit a report summarizing statewide implementation needs and costs to the governor and legislature by June 30, 2027.
