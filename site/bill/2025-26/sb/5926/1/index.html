<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that child care providers care for and serve some of Washington's most vulnerable populations. Existing privacy protections under RCW 42.56.640 apply only to licensed family home child care providers because their business operates within their private residence. However, the legislature further finds that child care providers working in licensed centers and other nonresidential care settings also face safety risks, harassment, doxxing, and targeted retaliation when their home addresses, personal phone numbers, photographs, and other identifying information are released publicly.</p>
<p>The legislature intends to extend the public records act privacy protections currently provided to licensed family home child care providers to all licensed child care providers, regardless of setting, to ensure that individuals who care for young children are protected from harm, intimidation, and threats to their personal safety.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
