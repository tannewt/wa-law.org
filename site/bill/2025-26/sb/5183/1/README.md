# SB 5183 - Tobacco & nicotine products

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5183.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds the following:

    a. Tobacco use remains a significant public health problem and impediment to health equity in Washington and across the country. It remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, killing more than 480,000 Americans each year, including 8,300 Washingtonians. Of cancer deaths in Washington, 27 percent are attributable to smoking.

    b. The growing market for flavored tobacco and nicotine products is undermining the nation's progress in reducing overall youth tobacco use. Flavored tobacco and nicotine products, including menthol cigarettes, have been shown to be starter products for youth who begin using tobacco, establishing tobacco habits that can lead to long-term addiction. Of youth who have ever used a tobacco product, eight out of 10 initiated with a flavored product.

    c. The United States surgeon general declared youth vapor product use an "epidemic" in 2018. More than 1,600,000 middle and high school students across the United States currently use vapor products, including almost eight percent of 10th graders and 14 percent of 12th graders in Washington. Of high school students who vape, 42 percent are addicted enough to use frequently or daily.

    d. Youth vape because they come in appealing, kid-friendly flavors like cotton candy, gummy bear, and pink lemonade. About 88 percent of youth who vape use a flavored product.

    e. The tobacco industry continues to redesign products to become even more appealing to youth, with some of the newest products featuring light-up video games like pac-man and tetris.

    f. Vaping is not harmless. Youth vapor product use is associated with an increased risk for cigarette smoking, and according to the surgeon general, nicotine can harm the parts of the adolescent brain responsible for attention, learning, mood, and impulse control, and can prime the brain for addiction to other drugs.

    g. Like vapor products, cigars are also sold in hundreds of flavors, including tropical twist, chocolate brownie, and cherry dynamite, which mask the harsh taste of tobacco. Black and Hispanic youth smoke cigars at higher rates than white youth. Regular cigar use can cause cancer of the oral cavity, larynx, esophagus, and lung, and it kills approximately 9,000 Americans each year.

    h. Each year, more than 9,100 kids in Washington try their first cigarette, with half initiating with menthol cigarettes. Menthol appeals to youth who are initiating tobacco use because it cools and numbs the throat and reduces irritation. The food and drug administration has concluded that menthol cigarettes lead to increased smoking initiation among youth and young adults, greater addiction, and decreased success in quitting smoking.

        i. The centers for disease control estimates that prohibiting menthol cigarettes in Washington state would lead to 7,400 adults to quit smoking.

    j. The tobacco industry has targeted African American communities for decades with marketing for menthol cigarettes through sponsorship of community and music events, targeted magazine advertising, and retail promotions. The result today is that 85 percent of Black smokers and 50 percent of Hispanic smokers smoke menthol cigarettes, compared to 29 percent of white smokers. Each year approximately 45,000 African Americans die from a smoking-caused illness. Ending the sale of flavored tobacco and nicotine products will improve the health and save lives of groups who historically have been targeted by the tobacco industry and disproportionally burdened by tobacco-related disease.

    k. The number of youth using nicotine pouches has more than doubled since 2021, with nearly half a million youth reporting current nicotine pouch use in 2024.

    l. Hookah smoking is linked to many of the same adverse health effects as cigarette smoking, such as heart disease and lung, bladder, and oral cancers. Hookah is available in more than 1,800 varieties, including kid-friendly flavors like bubble gum, cola, and watermelon, and 84 percent of youth hookah users use flavored hookah.

2. The legislature therefore intends to prohibit the sale of all flavored tobacco and nicotine products and entertainment vapor products to reduce youth usage and protect the next generation from a lifetime of addiction and premature death.

## Section 3
1. Beginning January 1, 2026, no retailer may sell, offer for sale, display, market, or advertise for sale in this state, any flavored tobacco or nicotine product or entertainment vapor product.

2. [Empty]

    a. There is a rebuttable presumption that a tobacco or nicotine product is a flavored tobacco or nicotine product if any communication by or on behalf of the manufacturer or retailer indicates that the product imparts a:

        i. Taste or smell other than the taste or smell of tobacco; or

        ii. Cooling or numbing sensation.

    b. Evidence of such communication may include but is not limited to the use of terms such as "cool," "chill," "ice," "fresh," "arctic," or "frost" to describe the product.

## Section 4
The department of health shall develop, implement, and maintain a statewide flavored tobacco and nicotine products and entertainment vapor products prevention and awareness campaign to address the use of such products. The campaign must educate the public about the health risks and addictive nature of flavored tobacco and nicotine products, include outreach to both youth and adults aimed at preventing use, and be consistent with best practices identified by the centers for disease control and prevention. The department, in consultation with the health care authority, may also include messaging focused on tobacco and nicotine addiction and prevention and resources for addiction treatment and services. The department shall report to the appropriate committees of the legislature regarding the status of such education program by January 1, 2026.

## Section 5
The liquor and cannabis board must adopt rules to implement the requirements of this chapter and for compliance education for licensed retailers, distributors, and manufacturers and their employees relating to abating violations of this chapter and rules adopted under this chapter.

## Section 6
It is an unfair or deceptive practice under RCW 19.86.020 for any retailer to sell, offer for sale, display, market, or advertise for sale any flavored tobacco or nicotine product or any entertainment vapor product in this state. The legislature finds that the practices covered by this chapter are matters vitally affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW. A violation of this chapter is not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business and is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce and an unfair method of competition for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW.
