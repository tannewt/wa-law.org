# SB 5678 - Residential landlord-tenant

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5678.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that the dynamic nature of the residential rental market in Washington state necessitates a thorough reevaluation of the existing residential landlord-tenant act. Recognizing the fundamental importance of stable housing for individuals and communities, it is evident that changes in societal and economic conditions may have impacted the effectiveness of the residential landlord-tenant act. Furthermore, differences in local ordinances have prevented consistent delivery and implementation of state law. The legislature acknowledges the need to adapt and enhance the current regulatory framework to address emerging challenges, ensure fair treatment for both landlords and tenants, and uphold the principles of housing stability and equity.

2. Therefore, the legislature intends to establish a task force dedicated to a comprehensive study of the residential landlord-tenant act. This task force will undertake a meticulous review of the existing legislation, analyzing its provisions, enforcement mechanisms, and practical implications. By soliciting input from diverse stakeholders, including landlords, tenants, legal experts, housing advocates, and industry representatives, the task force aims to gain a nuanced understanding of the contemporary issues within the residential rental sector. The legislature intends for this collaborative effort to result in evidence-based recommendations for potential amendments or enhancements to the residential landlord-tenant act, fostering a balanced and fair relationship between landlords and tenants while addressing the evolving needs of Washington's housing landscape.
