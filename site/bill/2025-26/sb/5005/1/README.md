# SB 5005 - Concerning transparency, public safety, and independent oversight of the city, county, and regional jail system in Washington state.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5005.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that independent oversight of correctional systems encourages public trust, supports safe and humane conditions for correctional employees and incarcerated people, enhances public safety, and promotes reform towards more rehabilitative and therapeutic correctional systems.

The legislature established the joint legislative task force on jail standards to study and make recommendations regarding jail conditions and oversight. This act reflects many of the findings and recommendations of that task force, whose members represented the senate and house of representatives, prosecutors, defense attorneys, law enforcement, courts, jail administrators, counties and cities, medical and mental health services providers, persons with lived experience, and others interested in the operation of jails.

The legislature further finds that the jail system has a significant impact on the people of Washington. In 2022, more than 130,000 people were booked into Washington jails and that, on any given day in 2022, more than 8,000 people were detained in Washington jails.

Until 1987, Washington jails were overseen by the Washington corrections standards board. This body was eliminated over the opposition of stakeholders including jail administrators, advocates, and the department of corrections.

The legislature further finds that an increasing number of states are establishing independent oversight of their correctional systems. At least 29 states have established independent correctional oversight to promote transparency and improve their correctional systems. Washington has already established independent oversight of juvenile detention facilities and state prisons.

The legislature declares that oversight and transparency are integral components of Washington state government, and data collection is one essential tool to allow the public, correctional administrators and staff, and policymakers to analyze existing practices. Independent oversight and data-driven decision-making help identify and solve problems and make the government accountable to the people of Washington state.

Therefore, the legislature resolves to establish independent oversight of Washington's jail system to ensure transparency, support safe and humane conditions for jail employees and incarcerated individuals, promote reform towards a more rehabilitative and therapeutic jail system, reduce jails' exposure to litigation, and promote cost savings.
