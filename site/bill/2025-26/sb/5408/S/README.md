[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5408-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The employer must disclose in each posting for each job opening the wage scale or salary range, and a general description of all of the benefits and other compensation to be offered to the hired applicant. For the purposes of this section, "posting" means any solicitation intended to recruit job applicants for a specific available position, including recruitment done directly by an employer or indirectly through a third party, and includes any postings done electronically, or with a printed hard copy, that includes qualifications for desired applicants.

2. Upon request of an employee offered an internal transfer to a new position or promotion, the employer must provide the wage scale or salary range for the employee's new position.

3. This section only applies to employers with 15 or more employees.

4. [Empty]

    a. A job applicant or an employee is entitled to the remedies in RCW 49.58.060 and 49.58.070 for violations of this section, subject to (b) of this subsection. Recovery of any wages and interest must be calculated from the first date wages were owed to the employee.

    b. Any individual may provide written notice to an employer alleging that the employer's job posting does not comply with subsection (1) of this section. This written notice must be provided prior to a job applicant seeking remedies in RCW 49.58.060 and 49.58.070. Once the employer receives notice from any individual as to a particular job posting, this constitutes adequate notice for the duration of that job posting for any job applicant to seek remedies pursuant to RCW 49.58.060 and 49.58.070. If the employer corrects the posting within 14 calendar days of receiving the written notice, and where applicable, contacts the third-party job posting entity with a demand to correct the insufficient job posting, no penalties, damages, or other relief may be assessed to the employer.
