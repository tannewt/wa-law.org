# SB 5680 - Mobility equipment repair

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5680.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that access to reliable mobility devices is critical for Washingtonians living with disabilities, the growing senior population, developmentally delayed children, and others. For those who rely on a power wheelchair or other mobility device, any delay in repair is not only a quality of life issue, but it can interfere with their employment, schooling, health, and safety. A recent survey of wheelchair users found that a majority of respondents had repair times that were at least four weeks, but often seven or more weeks. Therefore, the legislature intends to require mobility device manufacturers to make documentation, parts, embedded software, firmware, and tools available to independent repair providers and mobility device owners to ensure that there are more repair options available for Washingtonians, so no one has to wait for long repairs for vital equipment.

## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Authorized repair provider" means an individual or business that is unaffiliated with an original equipment manufacturer and that has an arrangement with the original equipment manufacturer to use the original equipment manufacturer's trade name, service mark, or other proprietary identifier for the purpose of offering the services of diagnosis, maintenance, or repair of equipment under the name of the original equipment manufacturer, or that has an arrangement with the original equipment manufacturer under which the individual or business offers the services of diagnosis, maintenance, or repair of equipment on behalf of the original equipment manufacturer. An original equipment manufacturer who offers the services of diagnosis, maintenance, or repair of its own equipment shall be considered an authorized repair provider with respect to such products.

2. "Authorized third-party provider" means an individual or business that is unaffiliated with an original equipment manufacturer and that has an arrangement with the original equipment manufacturer to use the original equipment manufacturer's trade name, service mark, or other proprietary identifier for the purpose of distributing documentation, parts, embedded software, firmware, or tools.

Such documentation, parts, embedded software, firmware, and tools shall be made available either directly by the original equipment manufacturer or via an authorized repair provider or authorized third-party provider.

Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to:

1. Require an original equipment manufacturer to sell parts if the parts are no longer made available to authorized repair providers by the original equipment manufacturer;

4. Require an original equipment manufacturer or an authorized repair provider to provide to an owner or independent repair provider access to information, other than documentation, that is provided by the original equipment manufacturer to an authorized repair provider pursuant to the terms of an arrangement described in section 2(1) of this act.

## Section 5
1. An original equipment manufacturer or authorized repair provider shall not be liable for any damage or injury to any equipment caused by an independent repair provider or owner which occurs during the course of services and is not attributable to the original equipment manufacturer or authorized repair provider other than if the failure is attributable to design or manufacturing defects.

2. The original equipment manufacturer does not warrant any services provided by independent repair providers.

## Section 6
1. The legislature finds that the practices covered by this chapter are matters vitally affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW. A violation of this chapter is not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business and is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce and an unfair method of competition for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW.

2. This chapter may be enforced solely by the attorney general under the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW.
