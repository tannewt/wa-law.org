<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that access to reliable mobility devices is critical for Washingtonians living with disabilities, the growing senior population, developmentally delayed children, and others. For those who rely on a power wheelchair or other mobility device, any delay in repair is not only a quality of life issue, but it can interfere with their employment, schooling, health, and safety. A recent survey of wheelchair users found that a majority of respondents had repair times that were at least four weeks, but often seven or more weeks. Therefore, the legislature intends to require mobility device manufacturers to make documentation, parts, embedded software, firmware, and tools available to independent repair providers and mobility device owners to ensure that there are more repair options available for Washingtonians, so no one has to wait for long repairs for vital equipment.</p>
