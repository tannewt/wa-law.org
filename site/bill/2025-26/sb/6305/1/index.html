<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Analyses by Milliman in 2017 and 2019 and RTI International in 2024 demonstrate that, over multiple years, Washington residents have experienced substantially greater difficulty accessing in-network mental health and substance use services than accessing medical and surgical services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2021, Washington residents were 7.1 times more likely to receive outpatient behavioral health services out-of-network than outpatient medical and surgical services; 12.1 times more likely for outpatient facility services; and 16.7 times more likely for inpatient behavioral health services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Washington, average in-network reimbursement in 2021 for medical and surgical clinicians was 41 percent higher than for behavioral health clinicians, indexed to medicare reimbursement. This gap discourages behavioral health clinicians from joining insurance networks and further limits access to care for enrollees. More recent Washington-specific data is unavailable due to the absence of standardized public reporting requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federal regulators have cited the RTI data as evidence of the need for greater accountability and transparency by health plans and issuers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Youth face even greater barriers to access due to health benefit plans' narrow networks that lack sufficient child and adolescent behavioral health providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Independent economic analyses by McKinsey and Company show that individuals with behavioral health diagnoses incur two to four times higher total medical costs than those without such diagnoses, largely because untreated behavioral health conditions worsen physical health outcomes. The same analyses by Milliman show that individuals with behavioral health diagnoses incur between 3.2 and 6.2 times higher medical costs. Earlier access to effective treatment reduces these downstream costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transparent, comparable information on coverage and access, including information maintained on a public dashboard, is an essential regulatory function necessary to effectuate compliance with state insurance laws, protect consumers and employers as informed purchasers, and reduce the higher downstream medical costs associated with untreated mental health and substance use disorders.</p>
