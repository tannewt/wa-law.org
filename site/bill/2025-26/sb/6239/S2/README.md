# SB 6239 - State tort claims

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6239-S2.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature recognizes that while private entrepreneurs voluntarily choose the ambit of their activity and can thereby exert some control over their exposure to liability, state government does not have the same flexibility. In acting for the public good and in responding to public need, state government must provide a broad range of services and perform a broad range of functions throughout the entire state, regardless of how much exposure to liability may be involved. The legislature also recognizes that the state and its political subdivisions provide essential public services and functions and that unlimited liability could disrupt or make prohibitively expensive the provision of such essential public services and functions.

2. The legislature finds that the right to sue the government is not considered a privilege or immunity requiring heightened scrutiny analysis by the courts. The right to pursue a government tort liability claim in court is not a fundamental right of state citizenship. Article II, section 26 of our state Constitution gives the legislature the sole authority to decide in what manner, and in what courts, suits may be brought against the state, rather than it being a fundamental right provided by the state Constitution itself, so long as it conforms to the equal protection guarantees of the state and federal constitutions. A distinction based on the age of claims serves a legitimate state interest in that it rationally relates to the purpose of the statute, to address old cases and provide all claimants justice by encouraging negotiation and fair settlement, and providing a fair but streamlined resolution that is less expensive and more efficient for all parties involved.

3. The legislature further finds that its power to control and regulate the right of suit against the state is plenary. The state may grant the right or refuse it as it chooses and when granted may annex such conditions thereto as it deems wise. Further, the state supreme court has consistently acknowledged this constitutional duty includes the power to establish conditions precedent before suit can be brought against the state, including the placement of reasonable procedural burdens that may be placed on tort claimants as long as such burdens are not substantial and do not constitute a real impediment to relief. The legislature therefore finds it necessary to protect the public treasury from increasing liability while providing a structured, fair process through arbitration for persons who seek compensation for injuries caused by government.

## Section 2
1. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, all civil actions, except for appeals from municipal or district courts, which are at issue in the superior court in counties which have authorized arbitration, where the sole relief sought is a money judgment, and where no party asserts a claim in excess of $15,000, or if approved by the superior court of a county by two-thirds or greater vote of the judges thereof, up to $100,000, exclusive of interest and costs, are subject to civil arbitration.

2. If approved by majority vote of the superior court judges of a county which has authorized arbitration, all civil actions which are at issue in the superior court in which the sole relief sought is the establishment, termination, or modification of maintenance or child support payments are subject to mandatory arbitration. The arbitrability of any such action shall not be affected by the amount or number of payments involved.

Filing a claim for damages within the time allowed by law shall be a condition precedent to the commencement of any action claiming damages.
