<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes a critical workforce shortage of public defense attorneys and public defense professional staff, who are necessary to ensure the right to counsel and due process guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States and the Washington state Constitution. The legislature recognizes that a variety of barriers impede recruitment and retention of public defense attorneys and public defense professional staff, particularly impacting certain underserved areas of the state. The legislature intends to promote policies that remove barriers and streamline pathways to public defense practice for attorneys and professional legal staff.</p>
