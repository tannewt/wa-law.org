[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5865-S.E.pdf)

## Section 1
1. Service of a writ for a continuing lien shall comply fully with RCW 6.27.110.

2. If the writ is directed to an employer for the purpose of garnishing the defendant's wages, the first answer shall accurately state, as of the date the writ of garnishment was issued as indicated by the date appearing on the last page of the writ, whether the defendant was employed by the garnishee defendant (and if not the date employment terminated), whether the defendant's earnings were subject to a preexisting writ of garnishment for continuing liens on earnings (and if so the date such writ will terminate and the current writ will be enforced), whether the defendant maintained a financial account with garnishee, and whether the garnishee defendant had possession of or control over any funds, personal property, or effects of the defendant (and if so the garnishee defendant shall list all of defendant's personal property or effects in its possession or control). The first answer shall further accurately state, as of the time of service of the writ of garnishment on the garnishee defendant, the amount due and owing from the garnishee defendant to the defendant, and the defendant's total earnings, allowable deductions, disposable earnings, exempt earnings, deductions for superior liens such as child support, and net earnings withheld under the writ. The first answer may be substantially in the same form as the form developed by the Washington pattern forms committee

.

3. In the event plaintiff fails to comply with this section, employer may elect to treat the garnishment as one not creating a continuing lien.

## Section 2
1. Where the garnishee's answer to a garnishment for a continuing lien reflects that the defendant is employed by the garnishee, the judgment or balance due thereon as reflected on the writ of garnishment shall become a lien on earnings due at the time of the effective date of the writ, as defined in this subsection, to the extent that they are not exempt from garnishment, and such lien shall continue as to subsequent nonexempt earnings until the total subject to the lien equals the amount stated on the writ of garnishment or until the expiration of the employer's payroll period ending on or before 60 days after the effective date of the writ, whichever occurs first, except that such lien on subsequent earnings shall terminate sooner if the employment relationship is terminated or if the underlying judgment is vacated, modified, or satisfied in full or if the writ is dismissed. The "effective date" of a writ is the date of service of the writ if there is no previously served writ; otherwise, it is the date of termination of a previously served writ or writs.

2. At the time of the expected termination of the lien, the plaintiff shall mail  the garnishee a copy of the second answer form developed by the Washington pattern forms committee or a substantially equivalent form.

3. Within 20 days of receipt of the second answer form the garnishee shall file a second answer in the form as provided in subsection (2) of this section, stating the total amount held subject to the garnishmentor otherwise containing the information required in subsection (2) of this section and a calculation indicating the total amount due and owing from the garnishee defendant to the defendant, the defendant's total earnings deductions, disposable earnings, exempt earnings, deductions for superior liens such as child support, and net earnings withheld under the writ.

## Section 3

## Section 4
Sections 1 and 2 of this act take effect May 1, 2027.
