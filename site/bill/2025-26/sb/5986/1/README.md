2. To claim the exemption under this section for qualifying housing, the owner of the property must submit an application with the county assessor in a form and manner required by the department.

3. At least 80 percent of the property tax savings from the valuation exemption authorized under this section must verifiably and uniformly inure to the benefit of a qualifying tenant or qualifying tenants. The requirement under this subsection (3) must be effectuated through a reduction, elimination, or refund of one or more rental payments due and payable by the qualifying tenant during the same calendar year in which the property owner benefits from the exemption authorized under this section.

    b. "Dwelling unit" means a structure or that part of a structure which is occupied by one person or by two or more persons maintaining a common household.

    c.
