    a. In addition to an approval process for residential development based on clear and objective development regulations as provided in subsection (1) of this section, a city or county may adopt and apply an alternative approval process for applications and permits for residential development based on approval criteria regulating, in whole or in part, appearance or aesthetics that are not clear and objective if:

        i. The applicant retains the option of proceeding under the approval process that meets the requirements of subsection (1) of this section;

        ii. The approval criteria for the alternative approval process comply with this chapter; and

    b. Subjective interpretations of nonobjective criteria, such as design guidelines, may not be the sole basis for denial or conditioning a permit in the alternative process if the application otherwise meets the requirements of this subsection and the applicant has retained the option to proceed under subsection (1) of this section. Any nonobjective criteria used in the alternative process should be clearly identified and articulated in publicly available advisory guidelines prior to application submittal.

3. Subject to subsection (1) of this section, this section does not infringe on the prerogative of a city or county to:

    a. Set approval standards under which a particular housing type is permitted outright;

    b. Impose special conditions upon approval of a specific development proposal;Â or

    c. Establish approval procedures.

4. By January 1, 2029, all development regulations in effect in a city or county must comply with the requirements of this section.

If the department determines that the adopted provisions do not meet the requirements of the model code developed under section 4 of this act or are not substantially similar to the requirements of the model code, the department shall notify the city or county of the deficiencies identified and proposed amendments to correct any deficiencies. Upon amendment of any provisions deemed to not meet the requirements of the model code, the city or county may resubmit the amended provisions to the department for approval.

7. Nothing in this section prevents the legislative authority from adopting changes in the future. Future changes may be submitted to the department for continued approval. Approval by the department of the adopted provisions will be considered to continue unless the legislative authority adopts changes and submits those changes to the department for approval and the department makes a written determination that the changes are not consistent with clear and objective standards.

Upon receipt of the notice from the department, the city or county must delay any final action to adopt any comprehensive plan or any amendment or its development regulations for at least 60 days. The tribe and the city or county may jointly agree to extend this period by notifying the department. A county or city must not be penalized for noncompliance under this chapter due to any delays associated with this process.

    c. Upon receipt of a request, the department shall provide comments to the county or city including a summary and supporting materials regarding the tribe's concerns.
