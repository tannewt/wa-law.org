Assessments may be performed by the department or by a contracted entity.

4. If a recipient refuses to engage in work and work activities required by the department,  the family's grant shall be reduced by the recipient's share and the department shall notify the recipient that the grant will be terminated if the case is not brought back into compliance within two months. The grant shall be terminated after two months of continuous noncompliance.
