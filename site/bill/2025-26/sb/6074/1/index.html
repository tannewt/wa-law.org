<p>Upon receipt of a petition for early release submitted under RCW 9.94A.730, or a petition for parole submitted under section 1 of this act, or upon determination of a parole eligibility review date pursuant to RCW 9.95.100 and 9.95.052, the  board must provide notice and a copy of a petition or parole eligibility documents to the sentencing court, prosecuting attorney, and crime victim or surviving family member. The board may request the prosecuting attorney to assist in contacting the crime victim or surviving family member. If requested in writing by the sentencing court, the prosecuting attorney, or the crime victim or surviving family member, the  board must also provide any assessment, psychological evaluation, institutional behavior record, or other examination of the offender. Notice of the early release hearing date or parole eligibility date, and any evaluations or information relevant to the release decision, must be provided at least ninety days before the early release hearing or parole eligibility review hearing. The records described in this section, and other records reviewed by the board in response to the petition or parole eligibility review, must be disclosed in full and without redaction. Copies of records to be provided to the sentencing court and prosecuting attorney under this section must be provided as required without regard to whether the board has received a request for copies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purpose of review by the board of a petition for early release or parole eligibility, it is presumed that none of the records reviewed are exempt from disclosure to the sentencing court, prosecuting attorney, and crime victim or surviving family member, in whole or in part. The board may not claim any exemption from disclosure for the records reviewed for an early release petition or parole eligibility review hearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board and its subcommittees must provide comprehensive minutes of all related meetings and hearings on a petition for early release or parole eligibility review hearing. The comprehensive minutes should include, but not be limited to, the board members present, the name of the petitioner seeking review, the purpose and date of the meeting or hearing, a listing of documents reviewed, the names of members of the public who testify, a summary of discussion, the motions or other actions taken, and the votes of board members by name. For the purposes of this subsection, &quot;action&quot; has the same meaning as in RCW 42.30.020. The comprehensive minutes must be publicly and conspicuously posted on the board's website within thirty days of the meeting or hearing, without any information withheld or redacted. Nothing in this subsection precludes the board from receiving confidential input from the crime victim or surviving family member.</p>

<h2 id="section-23">Section 23 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-23">¶</a></h2>
<p>Any offender released under RCW 9.95.420, 10.95.030(2),  9.94A.730, or section 1 of this act who is arrested and detained in physical custody by the authority of a community corrections officer, or upon the written order of the board, shall not be released from custody on bail or personal recognizance, except upon approval of the board and the issuance by the board of an order reinstating the offender's release on the same or modified conditions. All chiefs of police, marshals of cities and towns, sheriffs of counties, and all police, prison, and peace officers and constables shall execute any such order in the same manner as any ordinary criminal process.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If an offender released by the board under RCW 9.95.420, 10.95.030(2),  9.94A.730, or section 1 of this act violates any condition or requirement of community custody, the board may transfer the offender to a more restrictive confinement status to serve up to the remaining portion of the sentence, less credit for any period actually spent in community custody or in detention awaiting disposition of an alleged violation and subject to the limitations of subsection (2) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following the hearing specified in subsection (3) of this section, the board may impose sanctions such as work release, home detention with electronic monitoring, work crew, community restitution, inpatient treatment, daily reporting, curfew, educational or counseling sessions, supervision enhanced through electronic monitoring, or any other sanctions available in the community, or may suspend the release and sanction up to sixty days' confinement in a local correctional facility for each violation, or revoke the release to community custody whenever an offender released by the board under RCW 9.95.420, 10.95.030(2),  9.94A.730, or section 1 of this act violates any condition or requirement of community custody.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an offender released by the board under RCW 9.95.420, 10.95.030(2),  9.94A.730, or section 1 of this act is accused of violating any condition or requirement of community custody, he or she is entitled to a hearing before the board or a designee of the board prior to the imposition of sanctions. The hearing shall be considered as offender disciplinary proceedings and shall not be subject to chapter 34.05 RCW. The board shall develop hearing procedures and a structure of graduated sanctions consistent with the hearing procedures and graduated sanctions developed pursuant to RCW 9.94A.737. The board may suspend the offender's release to community custody and confine the offender in a correctional institution owned, operated by, or operated under contract with the state prior to the hearing unless the offender has been arrested and confined for a new criminal offense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hearing procedures required under subsection (3) of this section shall be developed by rule and include the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Hearings shall be conducted by members or designees of the board unless the board enters into an agreement with the department to use the hearing officers established under RCW 9.94A.737;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board shall provide the offender with findings and conclusions which include the evidence relied upon, and the reasons the particular sanction was imposed. The board shall notify the offender of the right to appeal the sanction and the right to file a personal restraint petition under court rules after the final decision of the board;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hearing shall be held unless waived by the offender, and shall be electronically recorded. For offenders not in total confinement, the hearing shall be held within 30 days of service of notice of the violation, but not less than 24 hours after notice of the violation. For offenders in total confinement, the hearing shall be held within 30 days of service of notice of the violation, but not less than 24 hours after notice of the violation. The board or its designee shall make a determination whether probable cause exists to believe the violation or violations occurred. The determination shall be made within 48 hours of receipt of the allegation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The offender shall have the right to: (i) Be present at the hearing; (ii) have the assistance of a person qualified to assist the offender in the hearing, appointed by the presiding hearing officer if the offender has a language or communications barrier; (iii) testify or remain silent; (iv) call witnesses and present documentary evidence; (v) question witnesses who appear and testify; and (vi) be represented by counsel if revocation of the release to community custody upon a finding of violation is a probable sanction for the violation. The board may not revoke the release to community custody of any offender who was not represented by counsel at the hearing, unless the offender has waived the right to counsel; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sanction shall take effect if affirmed by the presiding hearing officer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within seven days after the presiding hearing officer's decision, the offender may appeal the decision to the full board or to a panel of three reviewing examiners designated by the chair of the board or by the chair's designee. The sanction shall be reversed or modified if a majority of the panel finds that the sanction was not reasonably related to at least one of the following: (a) The crime of conviction; (b) the violation committed; (c) the offender's risk of reoffending; or (d) the safety of the community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section, no finding of a violation of conditions may be based on unconfirmed or unconfirmable allegations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-25">Section 25 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-25">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the event the board suspends the release status of an offender released under RCW 9.95.420, 10.95.030(2),  9.94A.730, or section 1 of this act by reason of an alleged violation of a condition of release, or pending disposition of a new criminal charge, the board may nullify the suspension order and reinstate release under previous conditions or any new conditions the board determines advisable under RCW 9.94A.704. Before the board may nullify a suspension order and reinstate release, it shall determine that the best interests of society and the offender shall be served by such reinstatement rather than return to confinement.</p>
