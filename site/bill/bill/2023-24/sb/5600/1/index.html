<ol>
<li>
<p>A state universal communications services program is established. The program is established to protect public safety and welfare under the authority of the state to regulate telecommunications under Article XII, section 19 of the state Constitution. The purpose of the program is to support continued provision of basic telecommunications services under rates, terms, and conditions established by the commission and the provision, enhancement, and maintenance of broadband services, recognizing that, historically, the incumbent public network functions to provide all communications services including, but not limited to, voice and broadband services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the program, eligible communications providers may receive distributions from the universal communications services account created in RCW 80.36.690 in exchange for the affirmative agreement to provide continued telecommunications services under the rates, terms, and conditions established by the commission under this chapter, and broadband services, for the period covered by the distribution. The commission must implement and administer the program under terms and conditions established in RCW 80.36.630 through 80.36.690. Expenditures for the program may not exceed $5,000,000 per fiscal year; provided, however, that if less than $5,000,000 is expended in any fiscal year, the unexpended portion must be carried over to subsequent fiscal years and, unless fully expended, must be available for program expenditures in such subsequent fiscal years in addition to the $5,000,000 allotted for each of those subsequent fiscal years.</p>

For purposes of determining the access line threshold in this subsection, the access lines or equivalents of all wireline affiliates must be counted as a single threshold, if the lines or equivalents are located in Washington;</p>

<li>
<p>The communications provider has adopted a plan to provide, enhance, or maintain broadband services in its service area; and</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>To receive a distribution under the program, an eligible communications provider must affirmatively consent to continue providing communications services to its customers under rates, terms, and conditions established by the commission pursuant to this chapter for the period covered by the distribution.</p>

<li>
<p>The commission must periodically review the accounts and records of any communications provider that receives distributions under the program to ensure compliance with the program and monitor the providers' use of the funds.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Any amounts recovered under this section must be deposited in the universal communications services account created in RCW 80.36.690.</p>

<h2 id="section-6">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6">¶</a></h2>
<p>The universal communications services account is created in the custody of the state treasurer.

Expenditures from the account may be used only for the purposes of the universal communications services program established in RCW 80.36.650 and commission expenses related to implementation and administration of the provisions of RCW 80.36.630 through 80.36.690 and section 212, chapter 8, Laws of 2013 2nd sp. sess.
