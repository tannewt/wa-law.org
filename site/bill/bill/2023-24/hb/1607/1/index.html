<p>Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, law enforcement shall provide a juvenile who is suspected of committing a criminal offense with access to an attorney for consultation, which may be provided in person, by telephone, or by video conference, before the juvenile waives any constitutional rights if a law enforcement officer:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Questions a juvenile during a custodial interrogation;</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Statements made by a juvenile after the juvenile is contacted by a law enforcement officer in a manner described under subsection (1) of this section are not admissible in the state's case in chief in a juvenile offender or adult criminal court proceeding in which said juvenile is a defendant, unless:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The juvenile has been provided with access to an attorney for consultation; and the juvenile provides an express waiver knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made by the juvenile after the juvenile has been fully informed of the rights being waived as required under RCW 13.40.140;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The statement is for impeachment purposes; or</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

<li>

<p>After the juvenile has consulted with legal counsel, the juvenile may advise, direct a parent or guardian to advise, or direct legal counsel to advise the law enforcement officer whether the juvenile chooses to assert or waive a constitutional right. Any assertion of constitutional rights by the juvenile through legal counsel must be treated by a law enforcement officer as though it came from the juvenile, however, legal counsel may not assert constitutional rights on behalf of the juvenile without the juvenile's consent. A juvenile who has asserted their constitutional rights directly or through a parent, guardian, or legal counsel may subsequently waive their constitutional rights at any time, if the waiver of any constitutional rights of the juvenile is made according to the applicable requirements of RCW 13.40.140.</p>
