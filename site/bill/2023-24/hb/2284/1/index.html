<p>The legislature finds that, during the 2020-21 school year, 39.2 percent of third grade students and 42.4 percent of fourth grade students were identified as reading below grade level. Learning to read and write is a core element of the state's statutory program of basic education and is the foundation for many other elements of the basic education program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that, during the 2021-22 school year, the system established to screen students for risks associated with reading difficulties, including dyslexia, identified over 20 percent of students as at risk and in need of additional supports.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that, in 2009, the United States department of education published a practice guide with evidence-based suggestions for implementing multitier interventions that are feasible and based on evidence from rigorous research. One of the recommendations is to use a curriculum that addresses the components of reading instruction (comprehension, fluency, phonemic awareness, phonics, and vocabulary) and relates to students' needs and developmental levels. The legislature acknowledges that these components are often referred to as &quot;structured literacy.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends that these components be incorporated into foundational curricula and expectations for teaching reading and writing in Washington public schools.</p>

<p>The legislature understands recent research indicates that African American and Hispanic children who show signs of dyslexia are less likely than white children to be identified as dyslexic through school screening programs, even after controlling for income level. The legislature recognizes that the scientific literature on reading and cognition indicates that instruction using the principles of structured literacy will benefit almost all students, not only those with indicators of dyslexia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to address this serious equity problem by ensuring that all students receive evidence-based reading and writing instruction using the principles of structured literacy.</p>

<p>The legislature recognizes that all elementary educators who support early literacy and reading and writing literacy need professional development on using the principles of structured literacy.</p>

<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to require that preservice and in-service elementary educators be trained to teach students to read and write using the evidence-based instructional practices in early literacy and reading and writing literacy.</p>
