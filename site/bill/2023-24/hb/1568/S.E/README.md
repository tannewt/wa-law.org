Notwithstanding (a) of this subsection, if the long-term care worker is not certified as a home care aide within 200 days after the date of hire, the long-term care worker may continue to work for an additional 100 days if the long-term care worker has proof of completion of the 75 hours of training required under RCW 74.39A.074(1).
