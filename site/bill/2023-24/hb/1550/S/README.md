# HB 1550 - Transition to kindergarten

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1550-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that high quality early learning is the best way to ensure children have the social-emotional skills and other skills they need to enter kindergarten ready to learn. Unfortunately, too many children across the state do not have access to high quality early learning.

2. The legislature recognizes that the early childhood education and assistance program, the state's preschool program, is expanding and will become an entitlement for eligible children in the year 2026. The fair start for kids act, enacted in 2021, is helping to expand access to more affordable, high quality child care; and early learning and federal early learning programs serve thousands of families across the state.

3. However, the legislature finds that these early learning programs do not yet reach all families in need. As a result, there are children about to enter kindergarten who need an opportunity for high quality preschool in order to be successful kindergarten students in the following school year. The legislature recognizes that school districts, especially those in communities with early learning deserts, can and do reach children who need these opportunities. Some school districts and charter schools have attempted to address this gap by creating programs referred to as transitional kindergarten using allocations appropriated for the state's program of basic education. These extrastatutory programs are established by school districts and charter schools on an ad hoc basis and not all of the programs referred to as transitional kindergarten meet the high quality age-appropriate early learning standards that other state-funded early learning programs are required to meet.

4. Therefore, the legislature intends to establish a transition to kindergarten program that meets early learning standards in lieu of transitional kindergarten programs and to help fill in gaps in access to high quality early learning for eligible children, especially in early learning deserts. School district transitional kindergarten programs in operation in 2023 will be converted to school district transition to kindergarten programs for eligible students, provided that the standards set forth in this act are met. The legislature intends to provide state funding, which is separate from and in addition to the state basic education allocation, for the transition to kindergarten program so that it can be offered at no charge to eligible students, and to prohibit the use of state basic education allocations for this program. The legislature further intends to clarify that these transition to kindergarten programs, which are offered at the school district's option, are not part of the state's required minimum instructional program of basic education and do not constitute enrollments for purposes of generating state basic education funding allocations. The legislature also intends to: Require that the early learning ecosystem work together; promote coordinated systems of comprehensive early learning services; maximize efficient use of state, federal, and local resources; and ensure that children and families get the early learning services they need in the most appropriate setting.

## Section 2
1. Establishment.

    a. The transition to kindergarten program is established to assist eligible children in need of additional preparation to be successful kindergarten students in the following school year. The program is not part of the state's instructional program of basic education under RCW 28A.150.220.

    b. The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall administer the program as required by this section.

    f. Each program classroom must be staffed with a teacher who holds a valid Washington teacher certificate and who either:

        i. Holds an early childhood education endorsement or an early childhood special education endorsement; or

        ii. Holds an elementary education endorsement and, within five years of initial assignment to the program, completes at least 30 college credits related to the state early childhood education core competencies established by the department of children, youth, and families.

    g. Authorized school districts are prohibited from establishing a policy of excluding an eligible child due only to the presence of a disability.

    h. Authorized school districts must work in collaboration with early learning partners to promote coordinated systems of comprehensive early childhood services.

    i. Nothing in this section prohibits authorized school districts from blending or colocating early learning programs, such as the program established under this section, the early childhood education and assistance program, the federal head start program, or private pay programs.

4. Funding.

    a. The office of the superintendent of public instruction must distribute to authorized school districts an amount per eligible child enrolled in a program that is the greater of: (i) The estimated allocation per kindergarten student statewide generated by the distribution formula under RCW 28A.150.260 (4)(a), (5), (6), and (8), and the allocation under RCW 28A.150.415; or (ii) an amount as specified in the omnibus operating appropriations act. The office of the superintendent of public instruction must prorate the amount per eligible child to account for enrollment in a program that is less than a full school day or a full school year.

    b. The office of the superintendent of public instruction must submit to the legislature by each December 1st a report that includes the following data: (i) The number of state-funded eligible children enrolled in programs operated by authorized school districts in the current school year; and (ii) the estimated number of eligible children that authorized school districts intend to enroll in the following school year.

5. Reapprovals and reauthorizations. The office of the superintendent of public instruction must establish processes to reapprove program sites and reauthorize school districts, periodically and, at a minimum, as required in the omnibus operating appropriations act.
