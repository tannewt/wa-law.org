<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that people that intentionally choose to block state highways without a permit create a safety risk that may result in the loss of life. Such illegal activities have resulted in death in the past that could have been avoided. This act provides consequences for endangering people, impeding emergency vehicles, and blocking the freedom of movement of others. The legislature recognizes the right to peacefully assemble. Endangering people's lives, the traveling public, and law enforcement officers is not part of a civil society when there are plenty of legal and safe times and locations for public discourse and assemblies.</p>
