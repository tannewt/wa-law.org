# HB 2358 - Obstructing highways

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2358.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that people that intentionally choose to block state highways without a permit create a safety risk that may result in the loss of life. Such illegal activities have resulted in death in the past that could have been avoided. This act provides consequences for endangering people, impeding emergency vehicles, and blocking the freedom of movement of others. The legislature recognizes the right to peacefully assemble. Endangering people's lives, the traveling public, and law enforcement officers is not part of a civil society when there are plenty of legal and safe times and locations for public discourse and assemblies.

## Section 2

    a. The person, acting with three or more persons together, intentionally obstructs vehicular traffic by walking, standing, or sitting in a manner that blocks without lawful authority the ability of a vehicle to drive on a state highway.

    b. Except as provided for in (c) of this subsection, obstructing highways is a gross misdemeanor.

    c. It is a class C felony if a person is a leader or organizer of the people engaging in obstructing highways and must pay a monetary penalty of at least $5,000, which may not be reduced to an amount less than $1,000.
