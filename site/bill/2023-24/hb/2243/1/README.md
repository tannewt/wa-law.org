# HB 2243 - Social equity land trust

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2243.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that access to affordable child care increases economic growth and labor force participation because too many working parents are forced to reduce their hours, decline promotional opportunities, or leave the workforce completely due to a lack of affordable and appropriate child care. This has, and continues to, disproportionately impact working-age mothers and contributes to the gender pay gap. The legislature recognizes that high quality, inclusive child care can reduce the opportunity gap for low-income children and black, indigenous, and children of color while consistently improving outcomes for all children both inside and outside of the classroom.

2. The legislature acknowledges that in 2019, the Washington state child care collaborative task force found that 49 percent of parents in the state found it difficult or very difficult to find, afford, and keep child care. The lack of child care was projected to cost the state $2,080,000,000 in the direct cost of turnover and missed work due to child care issues, with a total estimate of $6,500,000,000 in direct and opportunity costs due to employee child care issues. The legislature further finds that for over the past decade, the trend has been in the wrong direction, between 2010 and 2023, the state has seen a decrease of 2,000 family child care providers and 300 centers, contributing to an increase in child care deserts statewide. Child care deserts are most often in communities that struggle with health and economic disparities. Not having access to affordable child care is a further detriment that perpetuates cycles of poverty and inequities.

3. The legislature further finds that sustainably managed forests enhance carbon sequestration and reduce the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Sustainably managed forests can also provide a stream of revenue to support new and existing child care resources in the areas of greatest need in the state.

4. Accordingly, the legislature intends to create a permanent children's social equity land trust that will utilize the trust management expertise of the department of natural resources to deliver much needed revenue for child care programs while prioritizing funding for child care deserts to assist families with access to child care where the need is greatest.

    b. In managing forestlands acquired pursuant to this section, the department is not required to maximize revenue generation and may balance revenue generation with enhancement of natural carbon sequestration afforded by sustainable management of forests.

3. The department shall manage, care for, and protect these lands for the purposes of commercial forestry, which includes both carbon sequestration and revenue generation for child care grants to be awarded by the department of children, youth, and families under RCW 43.216.602.

4. To the extent consistent with the requirements of this chapter, the department shall manage lands acquired pursuant to this section in compliance with policies established by the board and with the procedures that govern the department's management of other forested lands.

Any revenue derived from any sale of lands acquired pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the child care trust account created in section 3 of this act.

7. The department may sell valuable materials from these lands in the same manner and purposes as the department is authorized to sell valuable materials from other state lands. In addition, the department is authorized to enter into contracts for payment for ecosystem service projects on public lands acquired under this section, on terms and conditions acceptable to the department, after approval by the board.

Following the deduction provided in RCW 79.64.110, revenue generated from activities on these lands, including the revenue derived from the sale of timber or other valuable materials from lands acquired pursuant to this section must be deposited in the child care trust account created in section 3 of this act.

## Section 4
Revenue derived from all leases, sales, contracts, licenses, permits, easements, and rights-of-way, on lands acquired pursuant to section 2 of this act are subject to the deduction in RCW 79.64.110 to cover the costs incurred by the department in carrying out the purposes of this chapter.

## Section 6
1. Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the department shall establish a grant program to retain and expand child care in child care deserts. Grants may be used for one-time costs associated with the opening of a child care site, including program costs, for providers who are newly licensed or are in the process of becoming licensed, or for supporting established child care sites that are in jeopardy of closure for financial reasons.

2. In awarding grants, the department must prioritize applications in a manner that supports racial equity across the state and must also prioritize applications that include funding for one or more of the following purposes:

    a. Personnel costs, including compensation, benefits, health care premium pay, or paid leave;

    b. Rent or mortgage payments;

    c. Copayment or tuition waivers for families receiving care, including refunds or credits to families who are not attending but are paying tuition in order to maintain a child's spot in the facility;

    d. Child care for historically disadvantaged populations;

    e. Child care during nonstandard hours and periods of the year;

    f. Outreach to families who may have stopped attending due to cost; and

    g. Mental health supports for children and employees.

3. In addition to other indicators identified by the department, the department may use the child care industry insights dashboard from the child care industry assessment as a tool to identify areas in which additional investments are needed in order to expand existing child care capacity to meet family demand and reduce child care deserts.
