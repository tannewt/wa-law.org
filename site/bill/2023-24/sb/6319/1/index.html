<li>
<p>In addition to the findings described in RCW 70A.555.005, the legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>In 2023, the legislature enacted producer responsibility requirements for most types of smaller and medium-sized batteries, but elected to further study how to best manage electric vehicle batteries prior to establishing producer responsibility requirements for such batteries;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In January of 2024, the state of New Jersey enacted the nation's first producer responsibility law focused on electric vehicle batteries; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state of California has taken important steps that will facilitate electric vehicle battery recycling, including by establishing requirements for electric vehicle battery labeling.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to make producers responsible for the end-of-life management of electric vehicle batteries, in order to ensure economically and environmentally beneficial use of the valuable resources contained in electric vehicle batteries.</p>
