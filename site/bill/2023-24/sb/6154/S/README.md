        i. Operation of a vehicle thereon; or

        ii. The operation thereon of the nonresident's vehicle with the nonresident's consent, express or implied.

    b. Such acceptance pursuant to (a) of this subsection shall be deemed equivalent to and construed to be an appointment by such nonresident of the secretary of state of the state of Washington to be the nonresident's true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served all lawful summons and processes against the nonresident growing out of any accident, collision, or liability in which such nonresident may be involved while operating a vehicle upon the public highways, or while the nonresident's vehicle is being operated thereon with the nonresident's consent, express or implied.

2. Such operation and acceptance pursuant to subsection (1) of this section shall be a signification of the nonresident's agreement that any summons or process against the nonresident which is so served shall be of the same legal force and validity as if served on the nonresident personally within the state of Washington.

3. A resident of this state appoints the secretary of state of the state of Washington as the person's lawful attorney for service of summons or process as provided in this section for nonresidents, if the resident, while operating a motor vehicle on the public highways of this state:

    a. Is involved in any accident, collision, or liability; and

    b. Thereafter at any time within the following three years cannot, after a due and diligent search, be found in this state .

4. Service of such summons or process under subsections (1) and (3) of this section shall be made by leaving a copy for record and for each address to be served thereof with a fee established by the secretary of state by rule with the secretary of state of the state of Washington, or at the secretary of state's office.

5. Such service pursuant to subsection (4) of this section shall be sufficient and valid personal service upon said resident or nonresident, provided that:

    a. Notice of such service and a copy of the summons or process is forthwith sent by registered mail with return receipt requested, by plaintiff to the defendant at the last known address of the said defendant; and

    b. The plaintiff's affidavit of compliance herewith are appended to the process, together with :
