<li>
<p>Operation of a vehicle thereon; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The operation thereon of the nonresident's vehicle with the nonresident's consent, express or implied, shall be deemed equivalent to and construed to be an appointment by such nonresident of the secretary of state of the state of Washington to be the nonresident's true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served all lawful summons and processes against the nonresident growing out of any accident, collision, or liability in which such nonresident may be involved while operating a vehicle upon the public highways, or while the nonresident's vehicle is being operated thereon with the nonresident's consent, express or implied.</p>
</li>
</ol>
