## Section 1

2. A permit for a new American dream home must be approved in a city or county according to the following criteria:

    a. Each American dream home is eligible to have impact fees imposed under RCW 82.02.050 offset by payments made to the city or county from the department pursuant to section 5 of this act;

    b. The city or county may not charge cumulative permitting fees for each American dream home that exceed $1,250, which must be offset by the distribution received by the city or county under section 2 of this act;

Provisions, such as covenants or other restrictions, are applied to ensure that each American dream home remains reserved for low-income households for a period of seven years from the date of the first sale of the home to an owner who will occupy the home. The covenant or restriction must provide that the American dream home is occupied by the owner that is qualified under this section. If an American dream home is resold any time within seven years after purchase of the home by the first owner-occupier, the price must be affordable for low-income households; however, this resale price requirement does not apply in the case of foreclosure if all permit fees, impact fees, and taxes, related to the American dream home have been paid in full to the appropriate authority;
