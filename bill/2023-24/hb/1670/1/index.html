<p>&quot;Population change&quot; means the annual percent increase in the population of a taxing district between the two most recent years as provided in the official population estimates published by the office of financial management for April 1st of the year before taxes are payable. If the office of financial management estimates a net decrease in a taxing district's population, for the purposes of this section, the population change is zero. For a county, the &quot;population of a taxing district&quot; means the population within the county's incorporated and unincorporated areas, unless the county taxing district boundaries are limited to the unincorporated county areas, in which case the &quot;population of a taxing district&quot; means the population of the unincorporated county areas only. For taxing districts that are not coterminous with one or more cities, towns, counties, or unincorporated county areas, or any combination thereof, as provided in the official population estimates published by the office of financial management in April of the year before the taxes are payable, &quot;population change&quot; means:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The population change for the city or town within which the taxing district is wholly located;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The population change for the county in which the taxing district is wholly located, when the taxing district is not wholly located within a city or town; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For taxing districts located in more than one county, the county population change for the county in which the greatest total taxable assessed value of the taxing district for the prior assessment year is located.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this subsection (3), the annual percent increase in population is calculated to the nearest tenth of one percent, rounding up to the next tenth of one percent if the second decimal place of the annual percent increase is five or greater.</p>
