## Section 1
1. When a school performs a records check under RCW 28A.400.303 on a parent, the school must comply with the requirements in this subsection.

    a. The school must notify applicants for volunteer positions about the process for parents to submit criminal innocence or rehabilitation-related documents.

    b. For a parent with one or more criminal convictions who has submitted a criminal innocence or rehabilitation-related document addressing each conviction, the school may not deny the parent's volunteer application based on a criminal conviction if the parent signed a statement indicating that the parent has not been convicted of any crime since the date that the criminal innocence or rehabilitation-related document was issued.

    c. For a parent with one or more criminal convictions who has not submitted a criminal innocence or rehabilitation-related document addressing each conviction, the school must complete the following process to determine whether to approve the parent's volunteer application. The school:

        i. Must consider the length of time since the commission of the last crime for which the parent was convicted and whether any criminal conviction involved a minor child victim; and

        ii. May consider: (A) The age of the parent on the date of the commission of the last crime for which the parent was convicted; (B) whether the parent has been approved by a state agency to have unsupervised access to children under 18 years of age or persons with developmental disabilities; or (C) limiting the parent's unsupervised access to children under 18 years of age and to persons with developmental disabilities if this would give the parent the opportunity to have meaningful involvement in the school.

    d. Within five days of denying the volunteer application of a parent, the school must notify the parent of the school's decision, state specific reasons for the denial, and provide the procedure for appealing the school's decision.

2. A parent whose volunteer application has been denied under this section may appeal to the office of the superintendent of public instruction according to procedures established by the superintendent of public instruction.

3. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

    a. "Criminal innocence or rehabilitation-related document" means evidence that a criminal conviction is the subject of: (i) Expungement, pardon, vacation, annulment, certificate of rehabilitation, or other equivalent procedure based on a finding of the rehabilitation of the person convicted; (ii) a pardon, annulment, or other equivalent procedure based on a finding of innocence; or (iii) a certificate of restoration of opportunity under RCW 9.97.020.

    b. "Parent" means a parent, grandparent, guardian, or legal custodian of a student enrolled at a school.

    c. "School" means a school district, educational service district, the Washington center for deaf and hard of hearing youth, the state school for the blind, a federal bureau of Indian affairs-funded school, a charter school established under chapter 28A.710 RCW, a school that is the subject of a state-tribal education compact under chapter 28A.715 RCW, or their contractors.

    d. "Unsupervised" has the same meaning as in RCW 28A.400.303.

## Section 2
1. If a volunteer alerts a school  that the volunteer has undergone a criminal records check in accordance with applicable state law, including RCW 10.97.050, 28A.400.303, 28A.410.010, or 43.43.830 through 43.43.845, within the two years before the time the volunteer is volunteering in the school, then the school may request that the volunteer furnish the school with a copy of the criminal history record information or sign a release to the business, school, organization, criminal justice agency, or juvenile justice or care agency, or other state agency that originally obtained the criminal history record information to permit the record information to be shared with the school. Once the school requests the information from the business, school, organization, or agency the information shall be furnished to the school. Any business, school, organization, agency, or its employee or official that shares the criminal history record information with the requesting school in accordance with this section is immune from criminal and civil liability for dissemination of the information.

If the criminal history record information is shared, the school must require the volunteer to sign a disclosure statement indicating that there has been no conviction since the completion date of the most recent criminal background inquiry.

2. For the purposes of this section, "school" has the same meaning as in section 1 of this act.
