1. A person may not:

2. The use or sale of software as described in subsection (1) of this section only violates this section if the user or seller knows or should know that the purpose of the software is to circumvent, thwart, interfere with, or evade a security measure, access control system, or other control or measure on a ticket seller's internet website, application, phone system, or similar technology that is used to enforce posted event admission ticket purchasing limits or to maintain the integrity of posted online admission ticket purchasing order rules.

## Section 11
1. A ticket seller may employ a nontransferable admission ticketing system only if the consumer is offered an option at the time of initial sale or presale to purchase the same admission ticket in a transferable form that allows admission tickets to be given away or resold independent of and without requiring the consumer to access or log into the ticket seller's website or platform, without penalty or discrimination.

The disclosure under subsection (1) of this section must include an approximate delivery date and the number of admission tickets that are guaranteed to be grouped together, including any designation by the venue of an assigned seating zone, section number, or seat number.

When fans felt the ticket sales industry created "bad blood" with consumers, they refused to be told "you need to calm down."

3. The legislature believes ticket sellers should be "fearless" in providing integrity, fairness, and transparency with consumers, and therefore, the legislature refuses to "shake it off."
