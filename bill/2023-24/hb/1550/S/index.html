<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that high quality early learning is the best way to ensure children have the social-emotional skills and other skills they need to enter kindergarten ready to learn. Unfortunately, too many children across the state do not have access to high quality early learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that the early childhood education and assistance program, the state's preschool program, is expanding and will become an entitlement for eligible children in the year 2026. The fair start for kids act, enacted in 2021, is helping to expand access to more affordable, high quality child care; and early learning and federal early learning programs serve thousands of families across the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, the legislature finds that these early learning programs do not yet reach all families in need. As a result, there are children about to enter kindergarten who need an opportunity for high quality preschool in order to be successful kindergarten students in the following school year. The legislature recognizes that school districts, especially those in communities with early learning deserts, can and do reach children who need these opportunities. Some school districts and charter schools have attempted to address this gap by creating programs referred to as transitional kindergarten using allocations appropriated for the state's program of basic education. These extrastatutory programs are established by school districts and charter schools on an ad hoc basis and not all of the programs referred to as transitional kindergarten meet the high quality age-appropriate early learning standards that other state-funded early learning programs are required to meet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to establish a transition to kindergarten program that meets early learning standards in lieu of transitional kindergarten programs and to help fill in gaps in access to high quality early learning for eligible children, especially in early learning deserts. School district transitional kindergarten programs in operation in 2023 will be converted to school district transition to kindergarten programs for eligible students, provided that the standards set forth in this act are met. The legislature intends to provide state funding, which is separate from and in addition to the state basic education allocation, for the transition to kindergarten program so that it can be offered at no charge to eligible students, and to prohibit the use of state basic education allocations for this program. The legislature further intends to clarify that these transition to kindergarten programs, which are offered at the school district's option, are not part of the state's required minimum instructional program of basic education and do not constitute enrollments for purposes of generating state basic education funding allocations. The legislature also intends to: Require that the early learning ecosystem work together; promote coordinated systems of comprehensive early learning services; maximize efficient use of state, federal, and local resources; and ensure that children and families get the early learning services they need in the most appropriate setting.</p>

<li>
<p>The transition to kindergarten program is established to assist eligible children in need of additional preparation to be successful kindergarten students in the following school year. The program is not part of the state's instructional program of basic education under RCW 28A.150.220.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall administer the program as required by this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</li>
<li>
<p>Describe the screening process or other instruments that the school district will use to individually determine whether an eligible child has a developmental delay or otherwise needs additional preparation to be successful in kindergarten in the following school year. Eligible children who are on the waitlist for early childhood education and assistance program sites are not required to be screened; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outline the school district's plan for coordinated recruitment and enrollment with other early learning program providers, including its proposed memoranda of understanding.</p>

<p>Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section and otherwise provided by law, it is the general policy of the state that the common schools shall be open to the admission of all persons who are five years of age and less than 21 years residing in that school district. Except as otherwise provided by law or rules adopted by the superintendent of public instruction, districts may establish uniform entry qualifications, including but not limited to birthdate requirements, for admission to kindergarten and first grade programs of the common schools. Such rules may provide for exceptions based upon the ability, or the need, or both, of an individual student. For the purpose of complying with any rule adopted by the superintendent of public instruction that authorizes a preadmission screening process as a prerequisite to granting exceptions to the uniform entry qualifications, a school district may collect fees to cover expenses incurred in the administration of any preadmission screening process: PROVIDED, That in so establishing such fee or fees, the district shall adopt rules for waiving and reducing such fees in the cases of those persons whose families, by reason of their low income, would have difficulty in paying the entire amount of such fees. Beginning with the 2024-25 school year, rules providing for exceptions to the uniform entry qualifications for kindergarten must limit early kindergarten admission to children deemed by the local educational service district, using multiple objective criteria, to be &quot;likely to be successful in kindergarten.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A student who meets the definition of a child of a military family in transition under Article II of RCW 28A.705.010 shall be permitted to continue enrollment at the grade level in the common schools commensurate with the grade level of the student when attending school in the sending state as defined in Article II of RCW 28A.705.010, regardless of age or birthdate requirements.</p>
