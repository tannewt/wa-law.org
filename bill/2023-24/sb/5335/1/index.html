<p>During this time of deep racial and socioeconomic inequity, Washingtonians have watched as loved ones and neighbors slipped through the widening gaps in our health care system. According to the Washington state department of health, the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened these structural disparities, showing in their recent COVID-19 morbidity report that the death and burden of this pandemic has disproportionately affected those already marginalized and underserved communities. With the intent to start healing the wounds of generations of inequality and to ensure a future where health care is recognized as a basic right afforded to each resident, the people of the state of Washington declare their intention to create a single, primary nonprofit health financing entity called the Washington health trust. The trust will simplify health care financing, eliminate administrative waste, respond to the health needs of each regional health district, and guarantee all residents coverage of a comprehensive set of essential health benefits without the burden of premiums, deductibles, copayments, or medical bills.</p>
<ol>

<p>All residents of the state of Washington are eligible for coverage through this chapter.</p>

<p>A participating health care provider is not required to furnish any health care service that is outside the scope of their practice or, in the health care provider's reasonable clinical judgment, not consistent with the accepted standard of care as described in RCW 7.70.040.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Only individual and joint taxpayers with federal net long-term capital gains or net earnings from self-employment of sole proprietors in excess of $15,000 on their federal tax return are required to file a capital gains tax return with the department. Each person required to file a return under this chapter must, without assessment, notice, or demand, pay any tax due thereon to the department on or before the date fixed for the filing of the return.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in this chapter or RCW 82.32.080, taxpayers owing tax under this chapter must file, on forms prescribed by the department, a return with the department on or before the date the taxpayer's federal income tax return for the taxable year is required to be filed along with all schedules and supporting documentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an adjustment to a taxpayer's federal return is made by the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, the taxpayer must, within 90 days of the final determination of the adjustment by the internal revenue service or within 30 days of the filing of a federal return adjusted by the taxpayer, file with the department on forms prescribed by the department a corrected return reflecting the adjustments as finally determined; however, such an amendment of the state return may take place only when the original filing was made in error. The taxpayer must pay any additional tax due resulting from the finally determined internal revenue service adjustment or a taxpayer adjustment without notice and assessment. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter or any other title to the contrary, the period of limitation for the collection of the additional tax, interest, and penalty due as a result of such an adjustment by the taxpayer or a finally determined internal revenue service adjustment must begin at the later of 30 days following the final determination of the adjustment or the date of the filing of the corrected return.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a taxpayer required to file a return under this section has obtained an extension of time for filing the federal tax return for the taxable year, the taxpayer is entitled to the same extension of time for filing the return required under this section if the taxpayer provides the department, before the due date provided in subsection (1) of this section, the extension confirmation number or other evidence satisfactory to the department confirming the federal extension. An extension under this subsection for the filing of a return under this chapter is not an extension of time to pay the tax due under this chapter.</p>

<li>
<p>If any return due on long-term capital gains under subsection (1) of this section, along with a copy of the federal tax return, is not filed with the department by the due date or any extension granted by the department, the department must assess a penalty in the amount of five percent of the tax due for the taxable year covered by the return for each month or portion of a month that the return remains unfiled. The total penalty assessed under this subsection may not exceed 25 percent of the tax due for the taxable year covered by the delinquent return.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The penalty under this subsection is in addition to any penalties assessed for the late payment of any tax due on the return.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must waive or cancel the penalty imposed under this subsection if:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The department is persuaded that the taxpayer's failure to file the return by the due date was due to circumstances beyond the taxpayer's control; or</p>
