<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Final regulations adopted by the United States environmental protection agency (EPA) require owners and operators of underground petroleum storage tanks to demonstrate financial responsibility for accidental releases of petroleum as a precondition to continued ownership and operation of such tanks;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial responsibility is demonstrated through the purchase of pollution liability insurance or an acceptable alternative such as coverage under a state financial responsibility program, in the amount of at least five hundred thousand dollars per occurrence and one million dollars annual aggregate depending upon the nature, use, and number of tanks owned or operated;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many owners and operators of underground petroleum storage tanks cannot purchase pollution liability insurance either because private insurance is unavailable at any price or because owners and operators cannot meet the rigid underwriting standards of existing insurers, nor can many owners and operators meet the strict regulatory standards imposed for alternatives to the purchase of insurance; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without a state financial responsibility program for owners and operators of underground petroleum storage tanks, many tank owners and operators will be forced to discontinue the ownership and operation of these tanks.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to create a state financial responsibility program meeting EPA standards for owners and operators of underground petroleum storage tanks in a manner that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Minimizes state involvement in pollution liability claims management and insurance administration;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protects the state of Washington from unwanted and unanticipated liability for accidental release claims;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creates incentives for private insurers to provide needed liability insurance; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parallels generally accepted principles of insurance and risk management.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To that end, this chapter establishes a temporary program to provide pollution liability reinsurance at a price that will encourage a private insurance company or risk retention group to sell pollution liability insurance in accordance with the requirements of this chapter to owners and operators of underground petroleum storage tanks, thereby allowing the owners and operators to comply with the financial responsibility regulations of the EPA. In the event that private insurance is not available in the state, this chapter provides an emergency program to address the need of owners and operators of underground petroleum storage tanks to demonstrate financial responsibility so that businesses may continue to operate.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>It is not the intent of this chapter to permit owners and operators of underground petroleum storage tanks to obtain pollution liability insurance without regard to the quality or condition of their storage tanks or without regard to the risk management practices of tank owners and operators, nor is it the intent of this chapter to provide coverage or funding for past or existing petroleum releases. Further, it is the intent of the legislature that the program follow generally accepted insurance underwriting and actuarial principles and to deviate from those principles only to the extent necessary and within the tax revenue limits provided, to make pollution liability insurance reasonably affordable and available to owners and operators who meet the requirements of this chapter, particularly to those owners and operators whose underground storage tanks meet a vital economic need within the affected community.</li>

<p>The director has the following powers and duties:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To design and from time to time revise a reinsurance contract providing coverage to an insurer meeting the requirements of this chapter. Before initially entering into a reinsurance contract, the director shall prepare an actuarial report describing the various reinsurance methods considered by the director and describing each method's costs. In designing the reinsurance contract the director shall consider common insurance industry reinsurance contract provisions and shall design the contract in accordance with the following guidelines:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The contract shall provide coverage to the insurer for the liability risks of owners and operators of underground storage tanks for third party bodily injury and property damage and corrective action that are underwritten by the insurer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the event of an insolvency of the insurer, the reinsurance contract shall provide reinsurance payable directly to the insurer or to its liquidator, receiver, or successor on the basis of the liability of the insurer in accordance with the reinsurance contract. In no event may the program be liable for or provide coverage for that portion of any covered loss that is the responsibility of the insurer whether or not the insurer is able to fulfill the responsibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The total limit of liability for reinsurance coverage shall not exceed one million dollars per occurrence and two million dollars annual aggregate for each policy underwritten by the insurer less the ultimate net loss retained by the insurer as defined and provided for in the reinsurance contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disputes between the insurer and the insurance program shall be settled through arbitration.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To design and implement a structure of periodic premiums due the director from the insurer that takes full advantage of revenue collections and projected revenue collections to ensure affordable premiums to the insured consistent with sound actuarial principles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To periodically review premium rates for reinsurance to determine whether revenue appropriations supporting the program can be reduced without substantially increasing the insured's premium costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To solicit bids from insurers and select an insurer to provide pollution liability insurance to owners and operators of underground storage tanks for third party bodily injury and property damage and corrective action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To monitor the activities of the insurer to ensure compliance with this chapter and protect the program from excessive loss exposure resulting from claims mismanagement by the insurer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To monitor the success of the program and periodically make such reports and recommendations to the legislature as the director deems appropriate, and to annually publish a financial report on the pollution liability insurance program trust account showing, among other things, administrative and other expenses paid from the fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To annually report the financial and loss experience of the insurer as to policies issued under the program and the financial and loss experience of the program to the legislature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To enter into contracts with public and private agencies to assist the director in his or her duties to design, revise, monitor, and evaluate the program and to provide technical or professional assistance to the director.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To examine the affairs, transactions, accounts, records, documents, and assets of insurers as the director deems advisable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To design, in consultation with the office of financial management, an emergency program to assist owners and operators of underground storage tanks in meeting the federal financial responsibility requirements in the event that a private insurer withdraws from the Washington pollution liability insurance program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To determine, assess, and collect moneys sufficient to cover the direct and indirect costs of implementing the emergency program, including initial program development costs. The moneys may be collected from underground storage tank owners and operators who are using the emergency program. All moneys collected under this section must be deposited in the pollution liability insurance program trust account created in RCW 70A.325.020.</p>

<li>
<p>In selecting an insurer to provide pollution liability insurance coverage to owners and operators of underground storage tanks, the director shall evaluate bids based upon criteria established by the director that shall include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The insurer's ability to underwrite pollution liability insurance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The insurer's ability to settle pollution liability claims quickly and efficiently;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The insurer's estimate of underwriting and claims adjustment expenses;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The insurer's estimate of premium rates for providing coverage;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The insurer's ability to manage and invest premiums; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The insurer's ability to provide risk management guidance to insureds.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The director shall select the bidder most qualified to provide insurance consistent with this chapter and need not select the bidder submitting the least expensive bid. The director may consider bids by groups of insurers and management companies who propose to act in concert in providing coverage and who otherwise meet the requirements of this chapter.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>The successful bidder shall agree to provide liability insurance coverage to owners and operators of underground storage tanks for third party bodily injury and property damage and corrective action consistent with the following minimum standards:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The insurer shall provide coverage for defense costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The insurer shall collect a deductible from the insured for corrective action in an amount approved by the director.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The insurer shall provide coverage for accidental releases in the amount of five hundred thousand dollars per occurrence and one million dollars annual aggregate but no more than one million dollars per occurrence and two million dollars annual aggregate exclusive of defense costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The insurer shall require insurance applicants to meet at least the following underwriting standards before issuing coverage to the applicant:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The applicant must be in compliance with statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, and orders governing the ownership and operation of underground storage tanks as identified by the director by rule; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The applicant must exercise adequate underground storage tank risk management as specified by the director by rule.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The insurer may exclude coverage for losses arising before the effective date of coverage, and the director may adopt rules establishing standards for determining whether a loss was incurred before the effective date of coverage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The insurer may exclude coverage for bodily injury, property damage, and corrective action as permitted by the director by rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The insurer shall use a variable rate schedule approved by the director taking into account tank type, tank age, and other factors specified by the director.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director shall adopt all rules necessary to implement this section. In developing and adopting rules governing rates, deductibles, underwriting standards, and coverage conditions, limitations, and exclusions, the director shall balance the owner and operator's need for coverage with the need to maintain the actuarial integrity of the program, shall take into consideration the economic impact of the discontinued use of a storage tank upon the affected community, and shall consult with the *standing technical advisory committee established under RCW 70A.325.040(3). In developing and adopting rules governing coverage exclusions affecting corrective action, the director shall consult with the Washington state department of ecology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding the definitions contained in RCW 70A.325.010, the director may permit an insurer to use different words or phrases describing the coverage provided under the program. In permitting such deviations from the definitions contained in RCW 70A.325.010, the director shall consider the regulations adopted by the United States environmental protection agency requiring financial responsibility by owners and operators of underground petroleum storage tanks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Owners and operators of underground storage tanks or sites containing underground storage tanks where a preexisting release has been identified or where the owner or operator knows of a preexisting release are eligible for coverage under the program subject to the following conditions:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The owner or operator must have a plan for proceeding with corrective action; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the owner or operator files a claim with the insurer, the owner or operator has the burden of proving that the claim is not related to a preexisting release until the owner or operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the director that corrective action has been completed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a reinsurance contract has been entered into by the agency and insurance companies, the director shall notify the department of ecology of the letting of the contract. Within thirty days of that notification, the department of ecology shall notify all known owners and operators of petroleum underground storage tanks that appropriate levels of financial responsibility must be established by October 26, 1990, in accordance with federal environmental protection agency requirements, and that insurance under the program is available. All owners and operators of petroleum underground storage tanks must also be notified that declaration of method of financial responsibility or intent to seek to be insured under the program must be made to the state by November 1, 1990. If the declaration of method of financial responsibility is not made by November 1, 1990, the department of ecology shall, pursuant to chapter 70A.355 RCW, prohibit the owner or operator of an underground storage tank from obtaining a tank tag or receiving petroleum products until such time as financial responsibility has been established.</p>
