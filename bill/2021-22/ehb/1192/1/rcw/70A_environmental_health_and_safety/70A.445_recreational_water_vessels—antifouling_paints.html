<p>Antifouling paints and coatings are necessary for the proper performance and preservation of boats and other marine craft. However, many of these substances contain copper, biocides, and other chemicals that are toxic to many aquatic organisms, including salmon. The legislature intends to phase out the use of copper-based and other antifouling paints and coatings that pose an undue threat to the environment when used on recreational water vessels. The legislature also intends to encourage the development of safer alternatives to traditional antifouling paints and coatings.</p>

<p>The department will conduct a review of information about antifouling paints and ingredients, including information received from manufacturers and others pursuant to this chapter; information on the feasibility of best management practices and nonbiocidal antifouling alternatives; and any additional scientific or technical information and studies it determines are relevant to that review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must submit a report to the legislature summarizing its findings no later than June 30, 2024. Prior to submitting the report to the legislature, the department will conduct a public comment process to obtain expertise, input, and a review of the department's proposed determinations by relevant stakeholders and other interested parties. The input received from the public comment process must be considered before finalizing the report.</p>
