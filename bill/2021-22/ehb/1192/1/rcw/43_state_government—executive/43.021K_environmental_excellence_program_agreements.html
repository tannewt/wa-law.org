<p>The purpose of chapter 381, Laws of 1997 is to create a voluntary program authorizing environmental excellence program agreements with persons regulated under the environmental laws of the state of Washington, and to direct agencies of the state of Washington to solicit and support the development of agreements that use innovative environmental measures or strategies to achieve environmental results more effectively or efficiently.</p>
<p>Agencies shall encourage environmental excellence program agreements that favor or promote pollution prevention, source reduction, or improvements in practices that are transferable to other interested entities or that can achieve better overall environmental results than required by otherwise applicable rules and requirements.</p>
<p>In enacting chapter 381, Laws of 1997 it is not the intent of the legislature that state environmental standards be applied in a manner that could result in these state standards being waived under section 121 of the federal comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 9261 [9621]).</p>

<p>An environmental excellence program agreement entered into under this chapter must achieve more effective or efficient environmental results than the results that would be otherwise achieved. The basis for comparison shall be a reasonable estimate of the overall impact of the participating facility on the environment in the absence of an environmental excellence program agreement. More effective environmental results are results that are better overall than those that would be achieved under the legal requirements superseded or replaced by the agreement. More efficient environmental results are results that are achieved at reduced cost but do not decrease the overall environmental results achieved by the participating facility. An environmental excellence program agreement may not authorize either (1) the release of water pollutants that will cause to be exceeded, at points of compliance in the ambient environment established pursuant to law, numeric surface water or groundwater quality criteria or numeric sediment quality criteria adopted as rules under chapter 90.48 RCW; or (2) the emission of any air contaminants that will cause to be exceeded any air quality standard as defined in RCW <strong>70A.15.1030</strong>(3); or (3) a decrease in the overall environmental results achieved by the participating facility compared with results achieved over a representative period before the date on which the agreement is proposed by the sponsor. However, an environmental excellence program agreement may authorize reasonable increases in the release of pollutants to permit increases in facility production or facility expansion and modification.</p>

<p>A decision by the directors of state, regional, or local agencies to approve a proposed environmental excellence program agreement, or to terminate or modify an approved environmental excellence program agreement, is subject to judicial review in superior court. For purposes of judicial review, the court may grant relief from the decision to approve or modify an environmental excellence program agreement only if it determines that the action: (a) Violates constitutional provisions; (b) exceeds the statutory authority of the agency; (c) was arbitrary and capricious; or (d) was taken without compliance with the procedures provided by this chapter.

<p>The legal requirements contained in the environmental excellence program agreement in accordance with RCW 43.21K.060(2) are enforceable commitments of the facility covered by the agreement. Any violation of these legal requirements is subject to penalties and remedies to the same extent as the legal requirements that they superseded or replaced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The voluntary goals stated in the environmental excellence program agreement in accordance with RCW 43.21K.060(3) are voluntary commitments of the facility covered by the agreement. If the facility fails to meet these goals, it shall not be subject to any form of enforcement action, including penalties, orders, or any form of injunctive relief. The failure to make substantial progress in meeting these goals may be a basis on which to terminate the environmental excellence program agreement under *section 11 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this chapter limits the authority of an agency, the attorney general, or a prosecuting attorney to initiate an enforcement action for violation of any applicable legal requirement. However, no civil, criminal, or administrative action may be brought with respect to any legal requirement that is superseded or replaced under the terms of an environmental excellence program agreement.</p>

<p>Agencies authorized to enter into environmental excellence program agreements may assess and collect a fee to recover the costs of processing environmental excellence program agreement proposals. The amount of the fee may not exceed the direct and indirect costs of processing the environmental excellence program agreement proposal. Processing includes, but is not limited to: Working with the sponsor to develop the agreement, meeting with stakeholder groups, conducting public meetings and hearings, preparing a record of the decision to enter into or modify an agreement, and defending any appeal from a decision to enter into or modify an agreement. Fees also may include, to the extent specified by the agreement, the agencies' direct costs of monitoring compliance with those specific terms of an agreement not covered by permits issued to the participating facility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agencies assessing fees may graduate the initial fees for processing an environmental excellence program agreement proposal to account for the size of the sponsor and to make the environmental excellence program agreement program more available to small businesses. An agency may exercise its discretion to waive all or any part of the fees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sponsors may voluntarily contribute funds to the administration of an agency's environmental excellence program agreement program.</p>
