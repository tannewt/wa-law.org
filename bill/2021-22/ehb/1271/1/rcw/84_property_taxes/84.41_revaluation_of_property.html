<p>Recent comprehensive studies by the legislative council have disclosed gross inequality and nonuniformity in valuation of real property for tax purposes throughout the state. Serious nonuniformity in valuations exists both between similar property within the various taxing districts and between general levels of valuation of the various counties. Such nonuniformity results in inequality in taxation contrary to standards of fairness and uniformity required and established by the Constitution and is of such flagrant and widespread occurrence as to constitute a grave emergency adversely affecting state and local government and the welfare of all the people.</p>
<p>Traditional public policy of the state has vested large measure of control in matters of property valuation in county government, and the state hereby declares its purpose to continue such policy. However, present statutes and practices thereunder have failed to achieve the measure of uniformity required by the Constitution; the resultant widespread inequality and nonuniformity in valuation of property can and should no longer be tolerated. It thus becomes necessary to require general revaluation of property throughout the state.</p>

<p>This chapter does not, and is not intended to affect procedures whereby taxes are imposed either for local or state purposes. This chapter concerns solely the administrative procedures by which the true and fair value in money of property is determined. The process of valuation, which is distinct and separate from the process of levying and imposing a tax, does not result either in the imposition of a tax or the determination of the amount of a tax. This chapter is intended to, and applies only to procedures and methods whereby the value of property is ascertained.</p>

All taxable real property within a county must be revalued annually, and all taxable real property within a county must be physically inspected at least once every six years. Each county assessor may disregard any program of revaluation, if requested by a property owner, and change, as appropriate, the valuation of real property upon the receipt of a notice of decision received under RCW 36.70B.130 or chapter 35.22, 35.63, 35A.63, or 36.70 RCW pertaining to the value of the real property.</p>

<p>The department will provide advisory appraisals of industrial properties valued at twenty-five million dollars or more in real and personal property value when requested by the county assessor.</p>
