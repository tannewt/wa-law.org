<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/36_counties/36.070A_growth_management%E2%80%94planning_by_selected_counties_and_cities.html">36.70A.210</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/36_counties/36.070A_growth_management%E2%80%94planning_by_selected_counties_and_cities.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that counties are regional governments within their boundaries, and cities are primary providers of urban governmental services within urban growth areas. For the purposes of this section, a &quot;countywide planning policy&quot; is a written policy statement or statements used solely for establishing a countywide framework from which county and city comprehensive plans are developed and adopted pursuant to this chapter. This framework shall ensure that city and county comprehensive plans are consistent as required in RCW 36.70A.100. Nothing in this section shall be construed to alter the land-use powers of cities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislative authority of a county that plans under RCW 36.70A.040 shall adopt a countywide planning policy in cooperation with the cities located in whole or in part within the county</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The countywide planning policy must be updated no later than fourteen months prior to any update of a comprehensive plan as required under RCW 36.70A.130</strong>.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>A countywide planning policy shall at a minimum, address the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Policies to implement RCW 36.70A.110;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policies for promotion of contiguous and orderly development and provision of urban services to such development;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policies for siting public capital facilities of a countywide or statewide nature, including transportation facilities of statewide significance as defined in RCW 47.06.140;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policies for countywide transportation facilities and strategies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policies that consider the need for affordable housing, such as housing for all economic segments of the population and parameters for its distribution**, and to address how the county and its cities will jointly meet the requirements to consider all housing types identified in RCW 36.70A.070(2), including, within an urban growth area boundary, single-family residences such as single-family detached dwellings, duplexes, triplexes, and townhomes. Such policies must address how the combined efforts of the county and its cities will ensure the housing element requirements in RCW 36.70A.070(2) are met as the county and each city update their comprehensive plans. The requirements of this subsection related to considering duplexes, triplexes, and townhomes within an urban growth area boundary do not apply to a county or city that is not subject to the review and evaluation requirements of RCW 36.70A.215 if the county or city has adopted findings and provided evidence as provided for in RCW 36.70A.070(2) that the current infrastructure within an urban growth area boundary is not capable of supporting such development or that there is little likelihood that infrastructure will be built to support such development within the 20-year planning period**;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Policies to address how the county and its cities will jointly meet the requirements of RCW 36.70A.070(1);</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policies for joint county and city planning within urban growth areas;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policies for countywide economic development and employment, which must include consideration of the future development of commercial and industrial facilities; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An analysis of the fiscal impact.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federal agencies and Indian tribes may participate in and cooperate with the countywide planning policy adoption process. Adopted countywide planning policies shall be adhered to by state agencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failure to adopt a countywide planning policy that meets the requirements of this section may result in the imposition of a sanction or sanctions on a county or city within the county, as specified in RCW 36.70A.340. In imposing a sanction or sanctions, the governor shall specify the reasons for failure to adopt a countywide planning policy in order that any imposed sanction or sanctions are fairly and equitably related to the failure to adopt a countywide planning policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cities and the governor may appeal an adopted countywide planning policy to the growth management hearings board within sixty days of the adoption of the countywide planning policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multicounty planning policies shall be adopted by two or more counties, each with a population of four hundred fifty thousand or more, with contiguous urban areas and may be adopted by other counties, according to the process established under this section or other processes agreed to among the counties and cities within the affected counties throughout the multicounty region.</p>
</li>
