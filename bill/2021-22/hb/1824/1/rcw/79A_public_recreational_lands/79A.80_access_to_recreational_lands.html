<p>Once each calendar year, the commission must provide at least two library discover passes to any library that submits a request to the commission, so that the library can provide the pass on a loan basis to their patrons as with other library materials. The commission is not required to replace any library discover pass that is lost or not returned. The commission should prioritize the distribution of any additional library discover passes to libraries that also check out outdoor equipment, such as backpacks, binoculars, field guides, and other equipment that will enhance the patron's outdoor experience.</p>
