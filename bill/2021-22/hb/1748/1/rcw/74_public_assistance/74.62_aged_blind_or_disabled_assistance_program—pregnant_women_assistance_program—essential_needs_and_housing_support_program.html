<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Persons who have a long-term disability and apply for federal supplemental security income benefits should receive assistance while their application for federal benefits is pending, with repayment from the federal government of state-funded income assistance paid through the aged, blind, or disabled assistance program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persons who are incapacitated from gainful employment for an extended period, but who may not meet the level of severity of a long-term disability, are at increased risk of homelessness; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persons who are homeless and suffering from significant medical impairments, mental illness, or chemical dependency face substantial barriers to successful participation in, and completion of, needed medical or behavioral health treatment services. Stable housing increases the likelihood of compliance with and completion of treatment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through chapter 36, Laws of 2011 1st sp. sess., the legislature intends to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Terminate all components of the disability lifeline program created in 2010 and codified in *RCW 74.04.005 and create new programs: (i) To provide financial grants through the aged, blind, and [or] disabled assistance program and the pregnant women assistance program; and (ii) to provide services through the essential needs and housing support program; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase opportunities to utilize limited public funding, combined with private charitable and volunteer efforts to serve persons who are recipients of the benefits provided by the new programs created under chapter 36, Laws of 2011 1st sp. sess.</p>
