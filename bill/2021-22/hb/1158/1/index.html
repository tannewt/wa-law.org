<li>
<p>Such other statutory and regulatory obligations or limitations prescribing the procedures for conduct of state business, or the orders, rules, or regulations of any state agency if strict compliance with the provision of any statute, order, rule, or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder, or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency, unless (i) authority to waive or suspend a specific statutory or regulatory obligation or limitation has been expressly granted to another statewide elected official, (ii) the waiver or suspension would conflict with federal requirements that are a prescribed condition to the allocation of federal funds to the state, or (iii) the waiver or suspension would conflict with the rights, under the First Amendment, of freedom of speech or of the people to peaceably assemble. The governor shall give as much notice as practical to legislative leadership and impacted local governments when issuing orders under this subsection (2)(g).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Any order issued under subsection (1) of this section must be narrowly tailored, using the least restrictive means to accomplish a compelling government interest.</strong></p>

<li>
<p>No order or orders <strong>issued under</strong> this section may continue for longer than thirty days unless extended by the legislature through concurrent resolution <strong>approved by a two-thirds vote in both the house of representatives and the senate</strong>. If the legislature is not in session, the <strong>order or orders</strong> may be extended in writing by the leadership of the senate and the house of representatives until the legislature can extend the <strong>order or orders</strong> by concurrent resolution. For purposes of this section, &quot;leadership of the senate and the house of representatives&quot; means the majority and minority leaders of the senate and the speaker and the minority leader of the house of representatives.</p>
</li>

<h2 id="section-2-1441">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-1441">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/34_administrative_law/34.05_administrative_procedure_act.html">34.05.350</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/34_administrative_law/34.05_administrative_procedure_act.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If an agency for good cause finds:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>That immediate adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule is necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety, or general welfare, and that observing the time requirements of notice and opportunity to comment upon adoption of a permanent rule would be contrary to the public interest;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That state or federal law or federal rule or a federal deadline for state receipt of federal funds requires immediate adoption of a rule; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to implement the requirements or reductions in appropriations enacted in any budget for fiscal year 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, or 2013, which necessitates the need for the immediate adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, and that observing the time requirements of notice and opportunity to comment upon adoption of a permanent rule would be contrary to the fiscal needs or requirements of the agency,</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>the agency may dispense with those requirements and adopt, amend, or repeal the rule on an emergency basis. The agency's finding and a concise statement of the reasons for its finding shall be incorporated in the order for adoption of the emergency rule or amendment filed with the office of the code reviser under RCW 34.05.380 and with the rules review committee.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>An emergency rule adopted under this section takes effect upon filing with the code reviser, unless a later date is specified in the order of adoption, and may not remain in effect for longer than one hundred twenty days after filing. Identical or substantially similar emergency rules may not be adopted in sequence unless conditions have changed or the agency has filed notice of its intent to adopt the rule as a permanent rule, and is actively undertaking the appropriate procedures to adopt the rule as a permanent rule. This section does not relieve any agency from compliance with any law requiring that its permanent rules be approved by designated persons or bodies before they become effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within seven days after the rule is adopted, any person may petition the governor requesting the immediate repeal of a rule adopted on an emergency basis by any department listed in RCW 43.17.010. Within seven days after submission of the petition, the governor shall either deny the petition in writing, stating his or her reasons for the denial, or order the immediate repeal of the rule. In ruling on the petition, the governor shall consider only whether the conditions in subsection (1) of this section were met such that adoption of the rule on an emergency basis was necessary. If the governor orders the repeal of the emergency rule, any sanction imposed based on that rule is void. This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit adoption of any rule as a permanent rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leadership of the senate and the house of representatives may petition the agency to limit the duration of the emergency rule. If at least two of the four leaders sign the petition, the rule may not remain in effect for longer than 30 days after the petition is sent. Identical or substantially similar emergency rules may not be adopted in sequence unless conditions have changed or the agency has filed notice of its intent to adopt the rule as a permanent rule, and is actively undertaking the appropriate procedures to adopt the rule as a permanent rule. This subsection (4) does not prohibit adoption of any rule as a permanent rule. For purposes of this subsection (4), &quot;leadership of the senate and the house of representatives&quot; means the majority and minority leaders of the senate and the speaker and the minority leader of the house of representatives.</strong></p>
