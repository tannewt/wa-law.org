<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>According to the Washington Constitution, it is &quot;the paramount duty&quot; of the state government to make &quot;ample provision&quot; for the basic education of all children residing within its borders, without distinction or preference on account of race, color, economic status, or sex;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test scores and other standard measurements of student achievement indicate that Washington's K-12 students are struggling and their proficiency in basic skills, particularly in reading and mathematics, has been in decline for several years;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parents and family members are and should be the primary decision makers about their children's well-being, including about what is best for their children's K-12 education;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington state should empower and support parents, families, and K-12 students to choose the educational environment that best suits each student's needs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state has authorized various education options, including traditional public schools, charter schools, some of which focus on educating children who are members of racial minority groups, home-based instruction, and private schools. However an inequity remains, families with greater financial means can choose from among these options, while families that do not have such means cannot. This inequity traps some K-12 students in failing schools or schools that do not meet their needs; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The recent COVID-19 pandemic has made the societal cost of this inequity plain and apparent.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to establish a more equitable funding program that empowers parents and families to make choices while providing greater educational equity, enrichment, and achievement. This program will use a system of vouchers and scholarship moneys to assure a uniform quality education for all of Washington's K-12 students.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2-1651">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-1651">¶</a></h2>

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The family empowerment scholarship program is established. The goal of the program is to empower parents and families to choose an educational environment and program that will prepare their students for postsecondary education, gainful employment or entrepreneurship, and a successful future, regardless of the parents' income level or zip code, by providing funding that includes only those minimum state controls necessary to ensure the proper administration of the program.</p>
