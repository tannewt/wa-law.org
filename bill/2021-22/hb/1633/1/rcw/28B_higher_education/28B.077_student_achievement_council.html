<p>The legislature recognizes that increasing educational attainment is critical to the social and economic well-being of Washington. It is the intent of the legislature to create the student achievement council to provide the focus and propose the goals for increasing educational attainment including improving student transitions from secondary to postsecondary education and training and between and among postsecondary institutions.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that increasing educational attainment is essential for maintaining the health of a democratic society and the competitiveness of the state in the global economy. By increasing educational attainment, students will develop into citizens who are more capable of critical thinking, more aware of their world and its diversity, more creative in their problem-solving, and more successful in addressing social and economic challenges of the future in an informed and thoughtful way.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that educational attainment is a powerful predictor of well-being. Students who have completed higher levels of education or training are more likely to achieve success in work or life and less likely to require taxpayer support. Education is perhaps the most important engine of economic growth and individual and financial health. Success in growing a stronger economy and democracy and lifting incomes and well-being depends upon increasing educational attainment.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that reaching the overall objective of increased educational attainment means that Washington's education systems must enable many more students to gain meaningful high school diplomas, postsecondary certificates, associate degrees, bachelor's degrees, and graduate degrees.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that the requirement for academic attainment is increasing. According to various academic studies, Washington's economy is becoming even more highly dependent on workers with postsecondary education. Other studies indicate that rates of successful participation in higher education by Washington residents, especially among lower-income and disadvantaged persons, are among the lowest in the nation.</p>
<p>Due to the large and growing gap between education requirements and achievement, it is the intent of the legislature to focus on increased educational attainment as a key priority and to closely track progress towards meeting this statewide objective.</p>

<li>
<p>Guided by the state's overarching objective of substantially increasing educational attainment for the purposes outlined in RCW 28B.77.001, the council has a dual mission:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>To propose to the governor and the legislature goals for increasing educational attainment in Washington, recommend the resources necessary to achieve the goals, and monitor progress toward meeting the goals;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To propose to the governor, the legislature, and the state's educational institutions, improvements and innovations needed to continually adapt the state's educational institutions to evolving educational attainment needs; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To advocate for higher education through various means, with the goal of educating the general public on the economic, social, and civic benefits of postsecondary education, and the consequent need for increased financial support and civic commitment in the state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the pursuit of the missions the council links the work of educational programs, schools, and institutions from secondary through postsecondary education and training and through careers. The council must connect the work of the superintendent of public instruction, the state board of education, the professional educator standards board, the state board for community and technical colleges, the workforce training and education coordinating board, and the four-year institutions of higher education, as well as the independent schools and colleges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drawing on the staff expertise of the council and other state, national, and international analysis and research assets, the council must also take a leading role in facilitating educational attainment analysis and research leading to increased educational attainment and education system development.</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The chair shall be selected by the council from among the citizen members appointed to the council. The chair shall serve a one-year term but may serve more than one term if selected to do so by the membership.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The council may create advisory committees on an ad hoc basis for the purpose of obtaining input from students, faculty, and higher education experts and practitioners, citizens, business and industry, and labor, and for the purpose of informing their research, policy, and programmatic functions. Ad hoc advisory committees addressing secondary to postsecondary transitions and university and college admissions requirements must include K-12 sector representatives including teachers, school directors, principals, administrators, and others as the council may direct, in addition to higher education representatives. The council shall maintain a contact list of K-12 and higher education stakeholder organizations to provide notices to stakeholders regarding the purposes of ad hoc advisory committees, timelines for planned work, means for participation, and a statement of desired outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any vacancies on the council shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointments. Appointments to fill vacancies shall be only for such terms as remain unexpired.

<li>
<p>Every two years the council shall produce, jointly with the state board for community and technical colleges and the workforce training and education coordinating board, an assessment of the number and type of higher education and training credentials required to match employer demand for a skilled and educated workforce.

<p>The council shall periodically recommend consolidation or elimination of programs at the four-year institutions of higher education, based on the needs assessment analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of a proposed major expansion or mission change, the needs assessment process under subsection (2) of this section constitutes a threshold inquiry. If the council determines that the need for the proposed major expansion or mission change has not been justified, the inquiry is concluded. If the council determines that the need for the proposed major expansion or mission change has been sufficiently established, the council, in consultation with any directly involved institutions and other interested agencies and individuals, shall proceed to examine the viability of the proposal using criteria including, but not limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The specific scope of the project including the capital investment requirements, the number of full-time equivalent students anticipated, and the number of academic programs planned;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The existence of an efficient and sustainable financial plan;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The extent to which existing resources can be leveraged;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The current and five-year projected student population, faculty, and staff to support the proposed programs, institution, or innovation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The plans to accommodate expected growth over a twenty-year time frame;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The extent to which new or existing partnerships and collaborations are a part of the proposal; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The feasibility of any proposed innovations to accelerate degree production.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the council completes its evaluation of the proposed major expansion or mission change using the needs assessment under subsection (2) of this section and viability determination under subsection (9) of this section, the council shall make a recommendation to either proceed, modify, or not proceed with the proposed major expansion or mission change. The council's recommendation shall be presented to the governor and the legislature.</p>
