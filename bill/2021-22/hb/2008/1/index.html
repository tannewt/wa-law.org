<h2 id="section-1-2045">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-2045">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that requiring intelligence quotient testing to determine if a person has an intellectual or developmental disability is expensive, inaccessible to marginalized communities, complicated to receive, and time consuming for families already struggling to care for their child with an intellectual or developmental disability. Further, the legislature finds that intelligence quotient testing does not accurately indicate whether a person needs support to be personally and socially productive, which is the goal of the developmental disabilities administration outlined in RCW 71A.10.015. Therefore, the legislature finds that requiring intelligence quotient testing in assessing whether a person has an intellectual or developmental disability is not an appropriate diagnostic tool and eliminating the use of intelligence quotient scores has been a goal of the legislature for more than 40 years.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-1630">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-1630">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This section adds a new section to an existing chapter <a href="/rcw/71A_developmental_disabilities/71A.10_general_provisions.html">71A.10</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/71A_developmental_disabilities/71A.10_general_provisions.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>By December 1, 2023, the department shall submit a report to the appropriate committees of the legislature with an assessment of the alternatives to using intelligence quotient scores in determining eligibility for programs and services for individuals with developmental disabilities and a plan to discontinue the use of intelligence quotient scores.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning July 1, 2025, the department may not use intelligence quotient scores in determining eligibility for developmental disability-related services for any programs or services for individuals with developmental disabilities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-4-970">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4-970">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/71A_developmental_disabilities/71A.16_eligibility_for_services.html">71A.16.020</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/71A_developmental_disabilities/71A.16_eligibility_for_services.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A person is eligible for services under this title if the secretary finds that the person has a developmental disability as defined in RCW 71A.10.020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The secretary may adopt rules further defining and implementing the criteria in the definition of &quot;developmental disability&quot; under RCW 71A.10.020. <strong>Beginning July 1, 2025, the criteria may not include the use of intelligence quotient scores as a determinant of developmental disability.</strong></p>
