<p>The legislature finds that the demand for truck parking in Washington far exceeds supply. In a 2016 Washington state department of transportation survey, over 60 percent of truckers reported spending an hour or more per day looking for parking. The shortage of truck parking stifles economic growth, increases pollution, and makes our roadways less safe as fatigued drivers cannot find a safe place to park.</p>
<p>In 2021, a jointly held workshop of the federal highway administration and Washington state department of transportation identified that Washington ranks low in truck parking availability, especially for private truck parking capacity. It found that truck parking capacity is generally most constrained where demand is highest in urban areas, mountain passes, border crossings, and near ports and industrial areas. The biggest hurdles for expanding capacity were high real estate costs and community opposition. The workshop resulted in several recommendations, including investigating whether state policies could be amended to encourage new truck parking developments, and specifically assessing incentives to develop more private spaces. Due to the presently existing significant safety, environmental, and economic consequences that result from the capacity shortfall, the legislature intends to address the expense of adding capacity through reducing taxes associated with expanding existing parking and developing new parking.</p>

<p>This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preference contained in sections 3 through 6, chapter . . ., Laws of 2022 (sections 3 through 6 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or to be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</p>

<li>
<p>The legislature categorizes this tax preference as one intended to provide incentives to increase safe overnight truck parking capacity pursuant to RCW 82.32.808(2)(f).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to increase public safety, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and foster economic development by increasing the state's capacity to move freight efficiently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the review finds that if both (a) the number of truck parking spaces suitable for overnight use has grown by at least 1,000 spaces from the effective date of this section, and (b) half of the truck parking spaces developed after the effective date of this section have either hydrogen fueling access or electric charging access, then the legislature intends to extend the expiration date of this tax preference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may refer to any data collected by the state. The Washington state department of transportation shall cooperate with requests for information from the joint legislative audit and review committee to document the location, number, and characteristics of truck parking spaces.</p>
