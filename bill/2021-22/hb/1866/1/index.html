<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The epidemic of homelessness apparent in communities throughout Washington is creating immense suffering. It is threatening the health of homeless families and individuals, sapping their human potential, eroding public confidence, and undermining the shared values that have driven our state's prosperity, including public safety and access to public streets, parks, and facilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In seeking to identify the causes of this epidemic, a large proportion of those unsheltered also suffer from serious behavioral health or physical health conditions that will inevitably grow worse without timely and effective health care;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Housing is an indispensable element of effective health care. Stable housing is a prerequisite to addressing behavioral health needs and lack of housing is a precursor to poor health outcomes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A home, health care, and wellness are fundamental for Washington residents;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing homelessness is a priority of the people of Washington state and that reducing homelessness through policy alignment and reform lessens fiscal impact to the state and improves the economic vitality of our businesses;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The impact of this epidemic is falling most heavily on those communities that already suffer the most serious health disparities: Black, indigenous, people of color, and historically marginalized and underserved communities. It is a moral imperative to shelter chronically homeless populations; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington state has many of the tools needed to address this challenge, including a network of safety net health and behavioral health care providers in both urban and rural areas, an effective system of health care coverage through apple health, and excellent public and nonprofit affordable housing providers. Yet far too many homeless families and individuals are going without the housing and health care resources they need because these tools have yet to be combined in an effective way across the state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to treat chronic homelessness as a medical condition and that the apple health and homes act address the needs of chronically homeless populations by pairing a health care problem with a health care solution.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2-2269">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-2269">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This section adds a new section to an existing chapter <a href="/rcw/74_public_assistance/74.09_medical_care.html">74.09</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/74_public_assistance/74.09_medical_care.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The definitions in this section apply throughout sections 3 and 4 of this act unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&quot;Community support services&quot; means active search and promotion of access to, and choice of, appropriate, safe, and affordable housing. The term includes, but is not limited to, services to medical assistance clients who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless through outreach, engagement, and coordination of services with shelter and housing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Coordinating entity&quot; means a private organization under contract with the authority to coordinate community support services as well as supportive housing functions as required under sections 3 and 4 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Homeless&quot; means living in a safe haven, an emergency shelter, or a place not meant for human habitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Housing benefit authorization&quot; means a statement from the coordinating entity to the office that a client receiving community support services has been determined to meet the eligibility standards under section 3 of this act to qualify for supportive housing and includes an assessment of the client's housing needs to assure that a supportive housing placement is appropriate and safe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Office&quot; means the office of health and homes created in section 5 of this act.</p>

<p>&quot;Regional service area&quot; means a regional service area established pursuant to RCW 74.09.870.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Supportive housing&quot; means subsidized housing that prioritizes people who need comprehensive support services to retain tenancy and utilizes admissions practices designed to use lower barriers to entry than would be typical for other subsidized or unsubsidized rental housing, especially related to rental history, criminal history, and personal behaviors. Supportive housing is paired with on-site or off-site voluntary services designed to support a person living with a complex and disabling behavioral health or physical health condition who was experiencing homelessness or was at imminent risk of homelessness prior to moving into housing to retain their housing and be a successful tenant in a housing arrangement, improve the resident's health status, and connect the resident of the housing with community-based health care, treatment, or employment services. Supportive housing is subject to all of the rights and responsibilities defined in chapter 59.18 RCW.</p>
