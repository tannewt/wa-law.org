## Section 1
> This section modifies existing section [36.70A.020](/rcw/36_counties/36.070A_growth_management—planning_by_selected_counties_and_cities.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/36_counties/36.070A_growth_management—planning_by_selected_counties_and_cities.md) for context.

The following goals are adopted to guide the development and adoption of comprehensive plans and development regulations of those counties and cities that are required or choose to plan under RCW 36.70A.040. The following goals are not listed in order of priority and shall be used exclusively for the purpose of guiding the development of comprehensive plans and development regulations:

1. Urban growth. Encourage development in urban areas where adequate public facilities and services exist or can be provided in an efficient manner.

2. Reduce sprawl. Reduce the inappropriate conversion of undeveloped land into sprawling, low-density development.

3. Transportation. Encourage efficient multimodal transportation systems that are based on regional priorities and coordinated with county and city comprehensive plans.

4. Housing. **Plan for and accommodate** housing **affordable** to all economic segments of the population of this state, promote a variety of residential densities and housing types, and encourage preservation of existing housing stock.

5. Economic development. Encourage economic development throughout the state that is consistent with adopted comprehensive plans, promote economic opportunity for all citizens of this state, especially for unemployed and for disadvantaged persons, promote the retention and expansion of existing businesses and recruitment of new businesses, recognize regional differences impacting economic development opportunities, and encourage growth in areas experiencing insufficient economic growth, all within the capacities of the state's natural resources, public services, and public facilities.

6. Property rights. Private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation having been made. The property rights of landowners shall be protected from arbitrary and discriminatory actions.

7. Permits. Applications for both state and local government permits should be processed in a timely and fair manner to ensure predictability.

8. Natural resource industries. Maintain and enhance natural resource-based industries, including productive timber, agricultural, and fisheries industries. Encourage the conservation of productive forestlands and productive agricultural lands, and discourage incompatible uses.

9. Open space and recreation. Retain open space, enhance recreational opportunities, conserve fish and wildlife habitat, increase access to natural resource lands and water, and develop parks and recreation facilities.

10. Environment. Protect the environment and enhance the state's high quality of life, including air and water quality, and the availability of water.

11. Citizen participation and coordination. Encourage the involvement of citizens in the planning process and ensure coordination between communities and jurisdictions to reconcile conflicts.

12. Public facilities and services. Ensure that those public facilities and services necessary to support development shall be adequate to serve the development at the time the development is available for occupancy and use without decreasing current service levels below locally established minimum standards.

13. Historic preservation. Identify and encourage the preservation of lands, sites, and structures, that have historical or archaeological significance.

A pattern of more intensive rural development, as provided in RCW 36.70A.070(5)(d), is not urban growth. When allowed to spread over wide areas, urban growth typically requires urban governmental services. "Characterized by urban growth" refers to land having urban growth located on it, or to land located in relationship to an area with urban growth on it as to be appropriate for urban growth.

29. "Urban growth areas" means those areas designated by a county pursuant to RCW 36.70A.110.

Wetlands may include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland areas created to mitigate conversion of wetlands.


## Section 7
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [36.70A](/rcw/36_counties/36.070A_growth_management—planning_by_selected_counties_and_cities.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/36_counties/36.070A_growth_management—planning_by_selected_counties_and_cities.md) for context.

In addition to ordinances, development regulations, and other official controls adopted or amended, a city or county should consider policies to encourage the construction of accessory dwelling units as a way to meet affordable housing goals. These policies could include, but are not limited to:

1. The city or county may not require the owner of a lot on which there is an accessory dwelling unit to reside in or occupy the accessory dwelling unit or another housing unit on the same lot;

2. The city or county may require the owner not to use the accessory dwelling unit for short-term rentals;

3. The city or county may not count residents of accessory dwelling units against existing limits on the number of unrelated residents on a lot;

4. The city or county may not establish a minimum gross floor area for accessory dwelling units that exceeds the state building code;

5. The city or county must make the same allowances for accessory dwelling units' roof decks, balconies, and porches to encroach on setbacks as are allowed for the principal unit;

6. The city or county must apply abutting lot setbacks to accessory dwelling units on lots abutting zones with lower setback requirements;

7. The city or county must establish an amnesty program to help owners of unpermitted accessory dwelling units to obtain a permit;

8. The city or county must permit accessory dwelling units in structures detached from the principal unit, must allow an accessory dwelling unit on any lot that meets the minimum lot size required for the principal unit, and must allow attached accessory dwelling units on any lot with a principal unit that is nonconforming solely because the lot is smaller than the minimum size, as long as the accessory dwelling unit would not increase nonconformity of the residential use with respect to building height, bulk, or lot coverage;

9. The city or county may not establish a maximum gross floor area requirement for accessory dwelling units that are less than 1,000 square feet or 60 percent of the principal unit, whichever is greater, or that exceeds 1,200 square feet;

10. A city or county must allow accessory dwelling units to be converted from existing structures, including but not limited to detached garages, even if they violate current code requirements for setbacks or lot coverage;

11. A city or county may not require public street improvements as a condition of permitting accessory dwelling units; and

12. A city or county may require a new or separate utility connection between an accessory dwelling unit and a utility only when necessary to be consistent with water availability requirements, water system plans, small water system management plans, or established policies adopted by the water or sewer utility provider. If such a connection is necessary, the connection fees and capacity charges must:

    a. Be proportionate to the burden of the proposed accessory dwelling unit upon the water or sewer system; and

    b. Not exceed the reasonable cost of providing the service.
