<p>In addition to ordinances, development regulations, and other official controls adopted or amended, a city or county should consider policies to encourage the construction of accessory dwelling units as a way to meet affordable housing goals. These policies could include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ol>

<p>The city or county may not require the owner of a lot on which there is an accessory dwelling unit to reside in or occupy the accessory dwelling unit or another housing unit on the same lot;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The city or county may not establish a minimum gross floor area for accessory dwelling units that exceeds the state building code;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The city or county must make the same allowances for accessory dwelling units' roof decks, balconies, and porches to encroach on setbacks as are allowed for the principal unit;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The city or county must apply abutting lot setbacks to accessory dwelling units on lots abutting zones with lower setback requirements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The city or county must establish an amnesty program to help owners of unpermitted accessory dwelling units to obtain a permit;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The city or county must permit accessory dwelling units in structures detached from the principal unit, must allow an accessory dwelling unit on any lot that meets the minimum lot size required for the principal unit, and must allow attached accessory dwelling units on any lot with a principal unit that is nonconforming solely because the lot is smaller than the minimum size, as long as the accessory dwelling unit would not increase nonconformity of the residential use with respect to building height, bulk, or lot coverage;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The city or county may not establish a maximum gross floor area requirement for accessory dwelling units that are less than 1,000 square feet or 60 percent of the principal unit, whichever is greater, or that exceeds 1,200 square feet;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A city or county must allow accessory dwelling units to be converted from existing structures, including but not limited to detached garages, even if they violate current code requirements for setbacks or lot coverage;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A city or county may not require public street improvements as a condition of permitting accessory dwelling units; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A city or county may require a new or separate utility connection between an accessory dwelling unit and a utility only when necessary to be consistent with water availability requirements, water system plans, small water system management plans, or established policies adopted by the water or sewer utility provider. If such a connection is necessary, the connection fees and capacity charges must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Be proportionate to the burden of the proposed accessory dwelling unit upon the water or sewer system; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not exceed the reasonable cost of providing the service.</p>
