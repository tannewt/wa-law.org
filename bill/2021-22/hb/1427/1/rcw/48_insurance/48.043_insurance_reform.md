## 48.43.001 - Intent.
It is the intent of the legislature to ensure that all enrollees in managed care settings have access to adequate information regarding health care services covered by health carriers' health plans, and provided by health care providers and health care facilities. It is only through such disclosure that Washington state citizens can be fully informed as to the extent of health insurance coverage, availability of health care service options, and necessary treatment. With such information, citizens are able to make knowledgeable decisions regarding their health care.

        i. Except for:

(A) The medically necessary services and prescription medications required by subsection (1)(e) of this section; and

(B) The drugs and products in subsection (1)(f) of this section; or

        ii. Unless the health plan is offered as a qualifying health plan for a health savings account. For such a qualifying health plan, the carrier must establish the plan's cost sharing for the coverage required by subsection (1) of this section at the minimum level necessary to preserve the enrollee's ability to claim tax exempt contributions and withdrawals from the enrollee's health savings account under internal revenue service laws and regulations; and

    b. May not require a prescription to trigger coverage of over-the-counter contraceptive drugs, devices, and products, approved by the federal food and drug administration, except those reproductive health-related drugs and products as set forth in subsection (1)(f) of this section.

3. A health carrier may not deny the coverage required in subsection (1) of this section because an enrollee changed the enrollee's contraceptive method within a twelve-month period.

4. Except as otherwise authorized under this section, a health benefit plan may not impose any restrictions or delays on the coverage required under this section, such as medical management techniques that limit enrollee choice in accessing the full range of contraceptive drugs, devices, or other products, approved by the federal food and drug administration.

5. Benefits provided under this section must be extended to all enrollees, enrolled spouses, and enrolled dependents.

6. This section may not be construed to allow for denial of care on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, marital status, age, citizenship, immigration status, or disability.

7. A health plan or student health plan, including student health plans deemed by the insurance commissioner to have a short-term limited purpose or duration or to be guaranteed renewable while the covered person is enrolled as a regular full-time undergraduate or graduate student at an accredited higher education institution, issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2021, may not issue automatic initial denials of coverage for reproductive health care services that are ordinarily or exclusively available to individuals of one gender, based on the fact that the individual's gender assigned at birth, gender identity, or gender otherwise recorded in one or more government-issued documents, is different from the one to which such health services are ordinarily or exclusively available.

8. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

    a. "Gender expression" means a person's gender-related appearance and behavior, whether or not stereotypically associated with the person's gender assigned at birth.

## 48.43.073 - Required abortion coverage—Limitations.
1. Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, if a health plan issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2019, provides coverage for maternity care or services, the health plan must also provide a covered person with substantially equivalent coverage to permit the abortion of a pregnancy. Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, if a student health plan, including student health plans deemed by the insurance commissioner to have a short-term limited purpose or duration or to be guaranteed renewable while the covered person is enrolled as a regular full-time undergraduate or graduate student at an accredited higher education institution, issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2022, provides coverage for maternity care or services, the health plan must also provide a covered person with substantially equivalent coverage to permit the abortion of a pregnancy.

2. [Empty]
    a. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, a health plan or student health plan subject to subsection (1) of this section may not limit in any way a person's access to services related to the abortion of a pregnancy.

    b. [Empty]
        i. Coverage for the abortion of a pregnancy may be subject to terms and conditions generally applicable to the health plan or student health plan's coverage of maternity care or services, including applicable cost sharing.

        ii. A health plan or student health plan is not required to cover abortions that would be unlawful under RCW 9.02.120.

3. Nothing in this section may be interpreted to limit in any way an individual's constitutionally or statutorily protected right to voluntarily terminate a pregnancy.

4. This section does not, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 18054(a)(6), apply to a multistate plan that does not provide coverage for the abortion of a pregnancy.

5. If the application of this section to a health plan or student health plan results in noncompliance with federal requirements that are a prescribed condition to the allocation of federal funds to the state, this section is inapplicable to the plan to the minimum extent necessary for the state to be in compliance. The inapplicability of this section to a specific health plan or student health plan under this subsection does not affect the operation of this section in other circumstances.

## 48.43.074 - Qualified health plans—Single invoice billing—Certification of compliance required in the segregation plan for premium amounts attributable to coverage of abortion services.
1. The legislature intends to codify the state's current practice of requiring health carriers to bill enrollees with a single invoice and to segregate into a separate account the premium attributable to abortion services for which federal funding is prohibited. Washington has achieved full compliance with section 1303 of the federal patient protection and affordable care act by requiring health carriers to submit a single invoice to enrollees and to segregate into a separate account the premium amounts attributable to coverage of abortion services for which federal funding is prohibited. Further, section 1303 states that the act does not preempt or otherwise have any effect on state laws regarding the prohibition of, or requirement of, coverage, funding, or procedural requirements on abortions.

2. In accordance with RCW 48.43.073 related to requirements for coverage and funding of abortion services, an issuer offering a qualified health plan must:

    a. Bill enrollees and collect payment through a single invoice that includes all benefits and services covered by the qualified health plan; and

    b. Include in the segregation plan required under applicable federal and state law a certification that the issuer's billing and payment processes meet the requirements of this section.

\[ [2019 c 399 § 5](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5602-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2019%20c%20399%20§%205); \]

## 48.43.078 - Digital breast tomosynthesis—Intent to ensure women with access—Commissioner's and health care authority's duty to clarify mandates.
1. Digital breast tomosynthesis, also called three-dimensional mammography, is the latest advancement in breast imaging. Studies indicate that digital breast tomosynthesis can result in a forty-one percent increase in invasive cancer detection, a fifteen percent decrease in the recall rate from screening mammography, and a twenty-nine percent increase in the detection of all breast cancers. In addition, the American college of radiology has indicated that tomosynthesis is no longer investigational. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to ensure women have access to the most effective breast imaging and to clarify that the existing mandate for mammography must include tomosynthesis.

2. The legislature directs the office of the insurance commissioner to clarify that the existing mandates for mammography in RCW 48.20.393, 48.21.225, 48.44.325, and 48.46.275 include coverage for tomosynthesis under the same terms and conditions currently allowed for mammography. The application of a deductible and cost sharing is prohibited, consistent with 42 U.S.C. Sec. 300-gg-13.

3. The legislature also directs the health care authority to clarify that the existing mandate for mammography in RCW 41.05.180 includes coverage for tomosynthesis under the same terms and conditions currently allowed for mammography. The application of a deductible and cost sharing is prohibited, consistent with 42 U.S.C. Sec. 300-gg-13.

2. Except for a physician at a referring laboratory that has been billed pursuant to subsection (1)(d) or (6) of this section, no licensed practitioner in the state may, directly or indirectly, charge, bill, or otherwise solicit payment for anatomic pathology services unless such services were rendered personally by the licensed practitioner or under the licensed practitioner's direct supervision in accordance with section 353 of the public health service act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 263a).

3. No patient, insurer, third-party payer, hospital, public health clinic, or nonprofit health clinic may be required to reimburse any licensed practitioner for charges or claims submitted in violation of this section.

4. Nothing in this section may be construed to mandate the assignment of benefits for anatomic pathology services as defined in this section.

5. For purposes of this section, "anatomic pathology services" means:

    a. Histopathology or surgical pathology, meaning the gross and microscopic examination performed by a physician or under the supervision of a physician, including histologic processing;

    b. Cytopathology, meaning the microscopic examination of cells from the following: (i) Fluids, (ii) aspirates, (iii) washings, (iv) brushings, or (v) smears, including the pap test examination performed by a physician or under the supervision of a physician;

    c. Hematology, meaning the microscopic evaluation of bone marrow aspirates and biopsies performed by a physician, or under the supervision of a physician, and peripheral blood smears when the attending or treating physician, or technologist requests that a blood smear be reviewed by a pathologist;

    e. Blood-banking services performed by pathologists.

6. The provisions of this section do not prohibit billing of a referring laboratory for anatomic pathology services in instances where a sample or samples must be sent to another physician or laboratory for consultation or histologic processing, except that for purposes of this subsection the term "referring laboratory" does not include a laboratory of a physician's office or group practice that does not perform the professional component of the anatomic pathology service involved.

7. The uniform disciplinary act, chapter 18.130 RCW, governs the discipline of any practitioner who violates the provisions of this section.

\[ [2012 c 100 § 1](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2306.SL.pdf?cite=2012%20c%20100%20§%201); [2011 c 128 § 1](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1190.SL.pdf?cite=2011%20c%20128%20§%201); \]

## 48.43.083 - Chiropractor services—Participating provider agreement—Health carrier reimbursement.
1. A health carrier must reimburse a chiropractor who has signed a participating provider agreement for services determined by the carrier to be medically necessary if:

    a. The service is:

        i. Covered chiropractic health care, as defined in RCW 48.43.515, by the health plan under which the enrollee received the services; and

        ii. Provided by the chiropractor, or the chiropractor's employee specified in RCW 18.25.190 (2) or (3) who works in the same location as the chiropractor and to whom the chiropractor, pursuant to rules adopted by the Washington state chiropractic quality assurance commission, has delegated the service. The employee must meet the health carrier's reasonable qualifications for all such providers in the relevant class, including but not limited to standards for education and background checks, as applicable; and

    b. The chiropractor complies with the terms and conditions of the participating provider agreement. Violations of the participating provider agreement by an employee of the chiropractor to whom he or she has delegated a service may be deemed by the carrier to have been committed by the chiropractor.

2. If a health carrier offers a participating provider agreement to a chiropractor within a single practice organized as a sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation, the carrier must offer the same participating provider agreement to any other chiropractor within that practice providing services at the same location. The agreement may allow either party to terminate it without cause.

## 48.43.085 - Health carrier may not prohibit its enrollees from contracting for services outside the health care plan.
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no health carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the state of Washington may prohibit directly or indirectly its enrollees from freely contracting at any time to obtain any health care services outside the health care plan on any terms or conditions the enrollees choose. Nothing in this section shall be construed to bind a carrier for any services delivered outside the health plan. The provisions of this section shall be disclosed pursuant to *RCW 48.43.095(2). The insurance commissioner is prohibited from adopting rules regarding this section.

\[ [1996 c 312 § 3](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1995-96/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6392-S.SL.pdf?cite=1996%20c%20312%20§%203); \]

## 48.43.087 - Contracting for services at enrollee's expense—Mental health care practitioner—Conditions—Exception.

2. Consistent with federal and state law and rule, no contract between a mental health care practitioner and an intermediary or between a mental health care practitioner and a health carrier that is written, amended, or renewed after June 6, 1996, may contain a provision prohibiting a practitioner and an enrollee from agreeing to contract for services solely at the expense of the enrollee as follows:

    a. On the exhaustion of the enrollee's mental health care coverage;

    b. During an appeal or an adverse certification process;

    c. When an enrollee's condition is excluded from coverage; or

## 48.43.093 - Health carrier coverage of emergency medical services—Requirements—Conditions.
1. When conducting a review of the necessity and appropriateness of emergency services or making a benefit determination for emergency services:

    a. A health carrier shall cover emergency services necessary to screen and stabilize a covered person if a prudent layperson acting reasonably would have believed that an emergency medical condition existed. In addition, a health carrier shall not require prior authorization of emergency services provided prior to the point of stabilization if a prudent layperson acting reasonably would have believed that an emergency medical condition existed. With respect to care obtained from an out-of-network hospital emergency department, a health carrier shall cover emergency services necessary to screen and stabilize a covered person. In addition, a health carrier shall not require prior authorization of the services provided prior to the point of stabilization.

    b. If an authorized representative of a health carrier authorizes coverage of emergency services, the health carrier shall not subsequently retract its authorization after the emergency services have been provided, or reduce payment for an item or service furnished in reliance on approval, unless the approval was based on a material misrepresentation about the covered person's health condition made by the provider of emergency services.

    c. Coverage of emergency services may be subject to applicable in-network copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles, as provided in chapter 48.49 RCW.

2. If a health carrier requires preauthorization for postevaluation or poststabilization services, the health carrier shall provide access to an authorized representative twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, to facilitate review. In order for postevaluation or poststabilization services to be covered by the health carrier, the provider or facility must make a documented good faith effort to contact the covered person's health carrier within thirty minutes of stabilization, if the covered person needs to be stabilized. The health carrier's authorized representative is required to respond to a telephone request for preauthorization from a provider or facility within thirty minutes. Failure of the health carrier to respond within thirty minutes constitutes authorization for the provision of immediately required medically necessary postevaluation and poststabilization services, unless the health carrier documents that it made a good faith effort but was unable to reach the provider or facility within thirty minutes after receiving the request.

3. A health carrier shall immediately arrange for an alternative plan of treatment for the covered person if an out-of-network emergency provider and health carrier cannot reach an agreement on which services are necessary beyond those immediately necessary to stabilize the covered person consistent with state and federal laws.

4. Nothing in this section is to be construed as prohibiting the health carrier from requiring notification within the time frame specified in the contract for inpatient admission or as soon thereafter as medically possible but no less than twenty-four hours. Nothing in this section is to be construed as preventing the health carrier from reserving the right to require transfer of a hospitalized covered person upon stabilization. Follow-up care that is a direct result of the emergency must be obtained in accordance with the health plan's usual terms and conditions of coverage. All other terms and conditions of coverage may be applied to emergency services.

    a. Benefits shall not be denied for any health care service performed by a pharmacist licensed under chapter 18.64 RCW if:

        i. The service performed was within the lawful scope of such person's license;

        ii. The plan would have provided benefits if the service had been performed by a physician licensed under chapter 18.71 or 18.57 RCW, an advanced registered nurse practitioner licensed under chapter 18.79 RCW, or a physician's assistant licensed under chapter 18.71A or 18.57A RCW; and

        iii. The pharmacist is included in the plan's network of participating providers; and

    b. The health plan must include an adequate number of pharmacists in its network of participating medical providers.

2. The participation of pharmacies in the plan network's drug benefit does not satisfy the requirement that plans include pharmacists in their networks of participating medical providers.

3. For health benefit plans issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2016, but before January 1, 2017, health plans that delegate credentialing agreements to contracted health care facilities must accept credentialing for pharmacists employed or contracted by those facilities. Health plans must reimburse facilities for covered services provided by network pharmacists within the pharmacists' scope of practice per negotiations with the facility.

    a. If an enrollee requests medication synchronization for a new prescription, the health plan must permit filling the drug: (i) For less than a one-month supply of the drug if synchronization will require more than a fifteen-day supply of the drug; or (ii) for more than a one-month supply of the drug if synchronization will require a fifteen-day supply of the drug or less.

    b. The health benefit plan shall adjust the enrollee cost-sharing for a prescription drug subject to coinsurance that is dispensed for less than the standard refill amount for the purpose of synchronizing the medications.

    c. The health benefit plan shall adjust the enrollee cost-sharing for a prescription drug with a copayment that is dispensed for less than the standard refill amount for the purpose of synchronizing the medications by:

        i. Discounting the copayment rate by fifty percent;

        ii. Discounting the copayment rate based on fifteen-day increments; or

        iii. Any other method that meets the intent of this section and is approved by the office of the insurance commissioner.

2. Upon request of an enrollee, the prescribing provider or pharmacist shall:

    a. Determine that filling or refilling the prescription is in the best interest of the enrollee, taking into account the appropriateness of synchronization for the drug being dispensed;

    b. Inform the enrollee that the prescription will be filled to less than the standard refill amount for the purpose of synchronizing his or her medications; and

    c. Deny synchronization on the grounds of threat to patient safety or suspected fraud or abuse.

3. For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings unless the context clearly requires otherwise:

    a. "Medication synchronization" means the coordination of medication refills for a patient taking two or more medications for a chronic condition such that the patient's medications are refilled on the same schedule for a given time period. 

    b. "Prescription" has the same meaning as in RCW 18.64.011.

## 48.43.105 - Preparation of documents that compare health carriers—Immunity—Due diligence.
1. A public or private entity who exercises due diligence in preparing a document of any kind that compares health carriers of any kind is immune from civil liability from claims based on the document and the contents of the document.

2. [Empty]
    a. There is absolute immunity to civil liability from claims based on such a comparison document and its contents if the information was provided by the carrier, was substantially accurately presented, and contained the effective date of the information that the carrier supplied, if any.

    b.

## 48.43.115 - Maternity services—Intent—Definitions—Patient preference—Clinical sovereignty of provider—Notice to policyholders—Application. (Effective until July 1, 2022.)
1. The legislature recognizes the role of health care providers as the appropriate authority to determine and establish the delivery of quality health care services to maternity patients and their newly born children. It is the intent of the legislature to recognize patient preference and the clinical sovereignty of providers as they make determinations regarding services provided and the length of time individual patients may need to remain in a health care facility after giving birth. It is not the intent of the legislature to diminish a carrier's ability to utilize managed care strategies but to ensure the clinical judgment of the provider is not undermined by restrictive carrier contracts or utilization review criteria that fail to recognize individual postpartum needs.

2. Unless otherwise specifically provided, the following definitions apply throughout this section:

    a. "Attending provider" means a provider who: Has clinical hospital privileges consistent with RCW 70.43.020; is included in a provider network of the carrier that is providing coverage; and is a physician licensed under chapter 18.57 or 18.71 RCW, a certified nurse midwife licensed under chapter 18.79 RCW, a midwife licensed under chapter 18.50 RCW, a physician's assistant licensed under chapter 18.57A or 18.71A RCW, or an advanced registered nurse practitioner licensed under chapter 18.79 RCW.

    d. Covered eligible services may not be denied for follow-up care, including in-person care, as ordered by the attending provider in consultation with the mother. Coverage for providers of follow-up services must include, but need not be limited to, attending providers as defined in this section, home health agencies licensed under chapter 70.127 RCW, and registered nurses licensed under chapter 18.79 RCW.

    e. This section does not require attending providers to authorize care they believe to be medically unnecessary.

4. A carrier that provides coverage for maternity services may not deselect, terminate the services of, require additional documentation from, require additional utilization review of, reduce payments to, or otherwise provide financial disincentives to any attending provider or health care facility solely as a result of the attending provider or health care facility ordering care consistent with this section. This section does not prevent any insurer from reimbursing an attending provider or health care facility on a capitated, case rate, or other financial incentive basis.

5. Every carrier that provides coverage for maternity services must provide notice to policyholders regarding the coverage required under this section. The notice must be in writing and must be transmitted at the earliest of the next mailing to the policyholder, the yearly summary of benefits sent to the policyholder, or January 1 of the year following June 6, 1996.

6. This section does not establish a standard of medical care.

7. This section applies to coverage for maternity services under a contract issued or renewed by a health carrier after June 6, 1996, and applies to plans operating under the health care authority under chapter 41.05 RCW beginning January 1, 1998.

Additional capital is used and useful in the insurance business and helps to secure a carrier against various risks inherent in, or affecting, the business of insurance and not accounted for or only partially measured by the risk-based capital requirements contained in RCW 48.43.300 through 48.43.370.

4. If a domestic carrier files an RBC report that in the judgment of the commissioner is inaccurate, then the commissioner shall adjust the RBC report to correct the inaccuracy and shall notify the carrier of the adjustment. The notice shall contain a statement of the reason for the adjustment.

## 48.43.335 - Confidentiality of RBC reports and plans—Use of certain comparisons prohibited—Certain information intended solely for use by commissioner.
1. All RBC reports, to the extent the information therein is not required to be set forth in a publicly available annual statement schedule, and RBC plans, including the results or report of any examination or analysis of a carrier and any corrective order issued by the commissioner, with respect to any domestic carrier or foreign carrier that are filed with the commissioner constitute information that might be damaging to the carrier if made available to its competitors, and therefore shall be kept confidential by the commissioner. This information shall not be made public or be subject to subpoena, other than by the commissioner and then only for the purpose of enforcement actions taken by the commissioner.

2. The comparison of a carrier's total adjusted capital to any of its RBC levels is a regulatory tool that may indicate the need for possible corrective action with respect to the carrier, and is not a means to rank carriers generally. Therefore, except as otherwise required under the provisions of RCW 48.43.300 through 48.43.370, the making, publishing, disseminating, circulating, or placing before the public, or causing, directly or indirectly, to be made, published, disseminated, circulated, or placed before the public, in a newspaper, magazine, or other publication, or in the form of a notice, circular, pamphlet, letter, or poster, or over any radio or television station, or in any other way, an advertisement, announcement, or statement containing an assertion, representation, or statement with regard to the RBC levels of any carrier, or of any component derived in the calculation, by any carrier, insurance producer, or other person engaged in any manner in the insurance business would be misleading and is therefore prohibited. However, if any materially false statement with respect to the comparison regarding a carrier's total adjusted capital to its RBC levels (or any of them) or an inappropriate comparison of any other amount to the carrier's RBC levels is published in any written publication and the carrier is able to demonstrate to the commissioner with substantial proof the falsity of such statement, or the inappropriateness, as the case may be, then the carrier may publish an announcement in a written publication if the sole purpose of the announcement is to rebut the materially false statement.

3. The RBC instructions, RBC reports, adjusted RBC reports, RBC plans, and revised RBC plans are intended solely for use by the commissioner in monitoring the solvency of carriers and the need for possible corrective action with respect to carriers and shall not be used by the commissioner for ratemaking nor considered or introduced as evidence in any rate proceeding nor used by the commissioner to calculate or derive any elements of an appropriate premium level or rate of return for any line of insurance that a carrier or any affiliate is authorized to write.

## 48.43.340 - Powers or duties of commissioner not limited—Rules.
1. The provisions of RCW 48.43.300 through 48.43.370 are supplemental to any other provisions of the laws and rules of this state, and shall not preclude or limit any other powers or duties of the commissioner under such laws and rules, including, but not limited to, chapter 48.31 RCW.

2. The commissioner may adopt reasonable rules necessary for the implementation of RCW 48.43.300 through 48.43.370.

    a. The date an RBC report would be required to be filed by a domestic carrier under RCW 48.43.300 through 48.43.370; or

    b. Fifteen days after the request is received by the foreign or alien carrier. Any foreign or alien carrier shall, at the written request of the commissioner, promptly submit to the commissioner a copy of any RBC plan that is filed with the insurance commissioner of any other state.

In this event, the failure of the foreign or alien carrier to file an RBC plan with the commissioner is grounds to order the carrier to cease and desist from writing new insurance business in this state.

3. In the event of a mandatory control level event with respect to any foreign or alien carrier, if no domiciliary receiver has been appointed with respect to the foreign or alien carrier under the rehabilitation and liquidation statute applicable in the state of domicile of the foreign or alien carrier, the commissioner may apply for an order under RCW 48.31.080 or 48.31.090 to conserve the assets within this state of foreign or alien carriers, and the occurrence of the mandatory control level event is considered adequate grounds for the application.

\[ [1998 c 241 § 10](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1997-98/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6302-S.SL.pdf?cite=1998%20c%20241%20§%2010); \]

## 48.43.535 - Independent review of health care disputes—System for using certified independent review organizations—Rules.
1. There is a need for a process for the fair consideration of disputes relating to decisions by carriers that offer a health plan to deny, modify, reduce, or terminate coverage of or payment for health care services for an enrollee. For purposes of this section, "carrier" also applies to a health plan if the health plan administers the appeal process directly or through a third party.

2. An enrollee may seek review by a certified independent review organization of a carrier's decision to deny, modify, reduce, or terminate coverage of or payment for a health care service, after exhausting the carrier's grievance process and receiving a decision that is unfavorable to the enrollee, or after the carrier has exceeded the timelines for grievances provided in RCW 48.43.530, without good cause and without reaching a decision.

3. The commissioner must establish and use a rotational registry system for the assignment of a certified independent review organization to each dispute. The system should be flexible enough to ensure that an independent review organization has the expertise necessary to review the particular medical condition or service at issue in the dispute, and that any approved independent review organization does not have a conflict of interest that will influence its independence.

4. Carriers must provide to the appropriate certified independent review organization, not later than the third business day after the date the carrier receives a request for review, a copy of:

    a. Any medical records of the enrollee that are relevant to the review;

    b. Any documents used by the carrier in making the determination to be reviewed by the certified independent review organization;

    c. Any documentation and written information submitted to the carrier in support of the appeal; and

    d. A list of each physician or health care provider who has provided care to the enrollee and who may have medical records relevant to the appeal. Health information or other confidential or proprietary information in the custody of a carrier may be provided to an independent review organization, subject to rules adopted by the commissioner.

5. Enrollees must be provided with at least five business days to submit to the independent review organization in writing additional information that the independent review organization must consider when conducting the external review. The independent review organization must forward any additional information submitted by an enrollee to the plan or carrier within one business day of receipt by the independent review organization.

6. The medical reviewers from a certified independent review organization will make determinations regarding the medical necessity or appropriateness of, and the application of health plan coverage provisions to, health care services for an enrollee. The medical reviewers' determinations must be based upon their expert medical judgment, after consideration of relevant medical, scientific, and cost-effectiveness evidence, and medical standards of practice in the state of Washington. Except as provided in this subsection, the certified independent review organization must ensure that determinations are consistent with the scope of covered benefits as outlined in the medical coverage agreement. Medical reviewers may override the health plan's medical necessity or appropriateness standards if the standards are determined upon review to be unreasonable or inconsistent with sound, evidence-based medical practice.

7. Once a request for an independent review determination has been made, the independent review organization must proceed to a final determination, unless requested otherwise by both the carrier and the enrollee or the enrollee's representative.

    a. An enrollee or carrier may request an expedited external review if the adverse benefit determination or internal adverse benefit determination concerns an admission, availability of care, continued stay, or health care service for which the claimant received emergency services but has not been discharged from a facility; or involves a medical condition for which the standard external review time frame would seriously jeopardize the life or health of the enrollee or jeopardize the enrollee's ability to regain maximum function. The independent review organization must make its decision to uphold or reverse the adverse benefit determination or final internal adverse benefit determination and notify the enrollee and the carrier or health plan of the determination as expeditiously as possible but within not more than seventy-two hours after the receipt of the request for expedited external review. If the notice is not in writing, the independent review organization must provide written confirmation of the decision within forty-eight hours after the date of the notice of the decision.

    b. For claims involving experimental or investigational treatments, the independent review organization must ensure that adequate clinical and scientific experience and protocols are taken into account as part of the external review process.

8. Carriers must timely implement the certified independent review organization's determination, and must pay the certified independent review organization's charges.

9. When an enrollee requests independent review of a dispute under this section, and the dispute involves a carrier's decision to modify, reduce, or terminate an otherwise covered health service that an enrollee is receiving at the time the request for review is submitted and the carrier's decision is based upon a finding that the health service, or level of health service, is no longer medically necessary or appropriate, the carrier must continue to provide the health service if requested by the enrollee until a determination is made under this section. If the determination affirms the carrier's decision, the enrollee may be responsible for the cost of the continued health service.

10. Each certified independent review organization must maintain written records and make them available upon request to the commissioner.

11. A certified independent review organization may notify the office of the insurance commissioner if, based upon its review of disputes under this section, it finds a pattern of substandard or egregious conduct by a carrier.

12. [Empty]
    a. The commissioner shall adopt rules to implement this section after considering relevant standards adopted by national managed care accreditation organizations and the national association of insurance commissioners.

    b. This section is not intended to supplant any existing authority of the office of the insurance commissioner under this title to oversee and enforce carrier compliance with applicable statutes and rules.

In exceptional circumstances, when the independent review organization has not obtained information necessary to make a determination, a determination may be made by the twenty-fifth day after the date the organization received the request for the determination; and

        ii. In requests for expedited review under RCW 48.43.535(7)(a), as expeditiously as possible but within not more than seventy-two hours after the date the independent review organization receives the request for expedited review;

    f. That timely notice is provided to enrollees of the results of the independent review, including the clinical basis for the determination;

    g. That the independent review organization has a quality assurance mechanism in place that ensures the timeliness and quality of review and communication of determinations to enrollees and carriers, and the qualifications, impartiality, and freedom from conflict of interest of the organization, its staff, and expert reviewers; and

    h. That the independent review organization meets any other reasonable requirements of the insurance commissioner directly related to the functions the organization is to perform under this section and RCW 48.43.535, and related to assessing fees to carriers in a manner consistent with the maximum fee schedule developed under this section.

3. To be certified as an independent review organization under this chapter, an organization must submit to the insurance commissioner an application in the form required by the insurance commissioner. The application must include:

    a. For an applicant that is publicly held, the name of each stockholder or owner of more than five percent of any stock or options;

5. An independent review organization may not be a subsidiary of, or in any way owned or controlled by, a carrier or a trade or professional association of health care providers or carriers.

6. An independent review organization, and individuals acting on its behalf, are immune from suit in a civil action when performing functions under chapter 5, Laws of 2000. However, this immunity does not apply to an act or omission made in bad faith or that involves gross negligence.

7. Independent review organizations must be free from interference by state government in its functioning except as provided in subsection (8) of this section.

8. The rules adopted under this section shall include provisions for terminating the certification of an independent review organization for failure to comply with the requirements for certification.

9. In adopting rules for this section, the insurance commissioner shall take into consideration rules adopted by the department of health that regulate independent review organizations and standards for independent review organizations adopted by national accreditation organizations. The insurance commissioner may accept national accreditation or certification by another state as evidence that an organization satisfies some or all of the requirements for certification by the insurance commissioner as an independent review organization.

1. [Empty]
    a. A health carrier shall adhere to the accepted standard of care for health care providers under chapter 7.70 RCW when arranging for the provision of medically necessary health care services to its enrollees. A health carrier shall be liable for any and all harm proximately caused by its failure to follow that standard of care when the failure resulted in the denial, delay, or modification of the health care service recommended for, or furnished to, an enrollee.

    b. A health carrier is also liable for damages under (a) of this subsection for harm to an enrollee proximately caused by health care treatment decisions that result from a failure to follow the accepted standard of care made by its:

        i. Employees;

        ii. Agents; or

        iii. Ostensible agents who are acting on its behalf and over whom it has the right to exercise influence or control or has actually exercised influence or control.

2. The provisions of this section may not be waived, shifted, or modified by contract or agreement and responsibility for the provisions shall be a duty that cannot be delegated. Any effort to waive, modify, delegate, or shift liability for a breach of the duty established by this section, through a contract for indemnification or otherwise, is invalid.

3. This section does not create any new cause of action, or eliminate any presently existing cause of action, with respect to health care providers and health care facilities that are included in and subject to the provisions of chapter 7.70 RCW.

4. It is a defense to any action or liability asserted under this section against a health carrier that:

    a. The health care service in question is not a benefit provided under the plan or the service is subject to limitations under the plan that have been exhausted;

    b. Neither the health carrier, nor any employee, agent, or ostensible agent for whose conduct the health carrier is liable under subsection (1)(b) of this section, controlled, influenced, or participated in the health care decision; or

    c. The health carrier did not deny or unreasonably delay payment for treatment prescribed or recommended by a participating health care provider for the enrollee.

5. This section does not create any liability on the part of an employer, an employer group purchasing organization that purchases coverage or assumes risk on behalf of its employers, or a governmental agency that purchases coverage on behalf of individuals and families. The governmental entity established to offer and provide health insurance to public employees, public retirees, and their covered dependents under RCW 41.05.140 is subject to liability under this section.

6. Nothing in any law of this state prohibiting a health carrier from practicing medicine or being licensed to practice medicine may be asserted as a defense by the health carrier in an action brought against it under this section.

7. [Empty]
    a. A person may not maintain a cause of action under this section against a health carrier unless:

        i. The affected enrollee has suffered substantial harm. As used in this subsection, "substantial harm" means loss of life, loss or significant impairment of limb, bodily or cognitive function, significant disfigurement, or severe or chronic physical pain; and

        ii. The affected enrollee or the enrollee's representative has exercised the opportunity established in RCW 48.43.535 to seek independent review of the health care treatment decision.

    b. This subsection (7) does not prohibit an enrollee from pursuing other appropriate remedies, including injunctive relief, a declaratory judgment, or other relief available under law, if its requirements place the enrollee's health in serious jeopardy.

8. In an action against a health carrier, a finding that a health care provider is an employee, agent, or ostensible agent of such a health carrier shall not be based solely on proof that the person's name appears in a listing of approved physicians or health care providers made available to enrollees under a health plan.

9. Any action under this section shall be commenced within three years of the completion of the independent review process.

10. This section does not apply to workers' compensation insurance under Title 51 RCW.

## 48.43.550 - Delegation of duties—Carrier accountability.
Each carrier is accountable for and must oversee any activities required by chapter 5, Laws of 2000 that it delegates to any subcontractor.

Any such request must specify why the carrier believes the provider owes the refund. If a provider fails to contest the request in writing to the carrier within thirty days of its receipt, the request is deemed accepted and the refund must be paid.

2. A carrier may not, if doing so for reasons related to coordination of benefits with another carrier or entity responsible for payment of a claim: (a) Request a refund from a health care provider of a payment previously made to satisfy a claim unless it does so in writing to the provider within thirty months after the date that the payment was made; or (b) request that a contested refund be paid any sooner than six months after receipt of the request. Any such request must specify why the carrier believes the provider owes the refund, and include the name and mailing address of the entity that has primary responsibility for payment of the claim. If a provider fails to contest the request in writing to the carrier within thirty days of its receipt, the request is deemed accepted and the refund must be paid.

3. A carrier may at any time request a refund from a health care provider of a payment previously made to satisfy a claim if: (a) A third party, including a government entity, is found responsible for satisfaction of the claim as a consequence of liability imposed by law, such as tort liability; and (b) the carrier is unable to recover directly from the third party because the third party has either already paid or will pay the provider for the health services covered by the claim.

4. If a contract between a carrier and a health care provider conflicts with this section, this section shall prevail. However, nothing in this section prohibits a health care provider from choosing at any time to refund to a carrier any payment previously made to satisfy a claim.

5. For purposes of this section, "refund" means the return, either directly or through an offset to a future claim, of some or all of a payment already received by a health care provider.

6. This section neither permits nor precludes a carrier from recovering from a subscriber, enrollee, or beneficiary any amounts paid to a health care provider for benefits to which the subscriber, enrollee, or beneficiary was not entitled under the terms and conditions of the health plan, insurance policy, or other benefit agreement.

7. This section does not apply to claims for health care services provided through dental only health carriers, health care services provided under Title XVIII (medicare) of the social security act, or medicare supplemental plans regulated under chapter 48.66 RCW.

1. Except in the case of fraud, or as provided in subsection (2) of this section, a health care provider may not: (a) Request additional payment from a carrier to satisfy a claim unless he or she does so in writing to the carrier within twenty-four months after the date that the claim was denied or payment intended to satisfy the claim was made; or (b) request that the additional payment be made any sooner than six months after receipt of the request. Any such request must specify why the provider believes the carrier owes the additional payment.

2. A health care provider may not, if doing so for reasons related to coordination of benefits with another carrier or entity responsible for payment of a claim: (a) Request additional payment from a carrier to satisfy a claim unless he or she does so in writing to the carrier within thirty months after the date the claim was denied or payment intended to satisfy the claim was made; or (b) request that the additional payment be made any sooner than six months after receipt of the request. Any such request must specify why the provider believes the carrier owes the additional payment, and include the name and mailing address of any entity that has disclaimed responsibility for payment of the claim.

3. If a contract between a carrier and a health care provider conflicts with this section, this section shall prevail. However, nothing in this section prohibits a carrier from choosing at any time to make additional payments to a provider to satisfy a claim.

4. This section does not apply to claims for health care services provided through dental only health carriers, health care services provided under Title XVIII (medicare) of the social security act, or medicare supplemental plans regulated under chapter 48.66 RCW.

2. For plan or policy years beginning January 1, 2014, a carrier offering a health benefit plan that meets the definition of bronze level in section 1302 of P.L. 111-148 of 2010, as amended, in the small group market outside of the exchange must also offer plans that meet the definition of silver and gold level plans in section 1302 of P.L. 111-148 of 2010, as amended, in the small group market outside of the exchange.

## 48.43.715 - Individual and small group market—Selection of benchmark plan—Minimum requirements—Criteria—List of state-mandated health benefits.
1. The commissioner, in consultation with the board and the health care authority, shall, by rule, select the largest small group plan in the state by enrollment as the benchmark plan for the individual and small group market for purposes of establishing the essential health benefits in Washington state.

2. If the essential health benefits benchmark plan for the individual and small group market does not include all of the ten essential health benefits categories, the commissioner, in consultation with the board and the health care authority, shall, by rule, supplement the benchmark plan benefits as needed.

3. All individual and small group health plans must cover the ten essential health benefits categories, other than a health plan offered through the federal basic health program, a grandfathered health plan, or medicaid. Such a health plan may not be offered in the state unless the commissioner finds that it is substantially equal to the benchmark plan. When making this determination, the commissioner:

    a. Must ensure that the plan covers the ten essential health benefits categories;

    b. May consider whether the health plan has a benefit design that would create a risk of biased selection based on health status and whether the health plan contains meaningful scope and level of benefits in each of the ten essential health benefits categories;

    c. Notwithstanding (a) and (b) of this subsection, for benefit years beginning January 1, 2015, must establish by rule the review and approval requirements and procedures for pediatric oral services when offered in stand-alone dental plans in the nongrandfathered individual and small group markets outside of the exchange; and

    d. Must allow health carriers to also offer pediatric oral services within the health benefit plan in the nongrandfathered individual and small group markets outside of the exchange.

4. Beginning December 15, 2012, and every year thereafter, the commissioner shall submit to the legislature a list of state-mandated health benefits, the enforcement of which will result in federally imposed costs to the state related to the plans sold through the exchange because the benefits are not included in the essential health benefits designated under federal law. The list must include the anticipated costs to the state of each state-mandated health benefit on the list and any statutory changes needed if funds are not appropriated to defray the state costs for the listed mandate. The commissioner may enforce a mandate on the list for the entire market only if funds are appropriated in an omnibus appropriations act specifically to pay the state portion of the identified costs.

    b. The commissioner must include in deliberations related to reinsurance rule making an analysis of an invisible high risk pool option, in which the full premium and risk associated with certain high-risk or high-cost enrollees would be ceded to the transitional reinsurance program. The analysis must include a determination as to whether that option is authorized under the federal reinsurance program regulations, whether the option would provide sufficiently comprehensive coverage for current nonmedicare high risk pool enrollees, and how an invisible high risk pool option could be designed to ensure that carriers ceding risk provide effective care management to high-risk or high-cost enrollees.

2. Consistent with federal law, the rules for the reinsurance program must, at a minimum, establish:

    a. A mechanism to collect reinsurance contribution funds;

    b. A reinsurance payment formula; and

    c. A mechanism to disburse reinsurance payments.

3. [Empty]
    a. The commissioner may adjust the rules adopted under this section as needed to preserve a healthy market both inside and outside of the exchange.

    b. The rules adopted under this section must identify and may require submission of the data needed to support operation of the reinsurance and risk adjustment programs established under this section. The commissioner must identify by rule the sources of the data, and other requirements related to the collection, validation, correction, interpretation, transmission or exchange, and retention of the data.

4. The commissioner shall contract with one or more nonprofit entities to administer the risk adjustment and reinsurance programs.

5. Contribution amounts for the transitional reinsurance program under section 1341 of P.L. 111-148 of 2010, as amended, may be increased to include amounts sufficient to cover the costs of administration of the reinsurance program including reasonable costs incurred for preoperational and planning activities related to the reinsurance program.

2. For the purpose of mitigating inequity in the health insurance market, unless waived by the commissioner pursuant to (c) of this subsection, the commissioner must assess a fee on any health carrier offering a health plan or student health plan if the health plan or student health plan excludes, under state or federal law, any essential health benefit or coverage that is otherwise required or mandated by this title or rules adopted by the commissioner.

As part of its rate filing, a health carrier subject to this subsection (2) must submit to the commissioner an estimate of the amount of the fee, including supporting documentation of its methods for estimating the fee. The carrier must include in its supporting documentation a certification by a member of the American academy of actuaries that the estimated fee is the actuarial equivalent of costs attributed to the provision and administration of the excluded benefit.

    b. Fees paid under this section must be deposited into the general fund.

    c. The commissioner may waive the fee assessed under this subsection (2) if he or she finds that the carrier excluding a mandated benefit for a health plan or student health plan provides health plan enrollees or student health plan enrollees alternative access to all excluded mandated benefits.

3. Beginning July 1, 2021, the commissioner shall provide on its website written notice of the carrier requirements in this section and information on alternate ways in which enrollees may access excluded benefits in a timely manner.

4. Stand-alone dental and stand-alone vision plans offered by a disability insurer to out-of-state groups specified by RCW 48.21.010(2) may be negotiated, but may not be offered in this state before the commissioner finds that the stand-alone dental or stand-alone vision plan otherwise meets the standards set forth in RCW 48.21.010(2) (a) and (b).
