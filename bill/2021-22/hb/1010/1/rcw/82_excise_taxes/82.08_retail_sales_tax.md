            B.  The purchaser identifies himself or herself to the seller as a member of a group or organization entitled to a price reduction or discount, however a "preferred customer" card that is available to any patron does not constitute membership in such a group; or

The exemption only applies if:

    a.  The property is for use outside this state;

However, the exemption provided by this section does not apply if tangible personal property is installed by the seller during the course of repairing, cleaning, altering, or improving motor vehicles, trailers, or campers and the seller makes a single nonitemized charge for providing the tangible personal property and service.

    c.  [Empty]

        i.  "Prepared food" means:

            A.  Food sold in a heated state or heated by the seller;

            B.  Food sold with eating utensils provided by the seller, including plates, knives, forks, spoons, glasses, cups, napkins, or straws. A plate does not include a container or packaging used to transport the food; or

            C.  Two or more food ingredients mixed or combined by the seller for sale as a single item, except:

                I.  Food that is only cut, repackaged, or pasteurized by the seller; or

                II.

        ii.  Food is "sold with eating utensils provided by the seller" if:

            A.  The seller's customary practice for that item is to physically deliver or hand a utensil to the customer with the food or food ingredient as part of the sales transaction. If the food or food ingredient is prepackaged with a utensil, the seller is considered to have physically delivered a utensil to the customer unless the food and utensil are prepackaged together by a food manufacturer classified under sector 311 of the North American industry classification system (NAICS);

            B.  A plate, glass, cup, or bowl is necessary to receive the food or food ingredient, and the seller makes those utensils available to its customers; or

            C.  [Empty]

                I.  The seller makes utensils available to its customers, and the seller has more than seventy-five percent prepared food sales. For purposes of this subsection (2)(c)(ii)(C), a seller has more than seventy-five percent prepared food sales if the seller's gross retail sales of prepared food under (c)(i)(A), (c)(i)(C), and (c)(ii)(B) of this subsection equal more than seventy-five percent of the seller's gross retail sales of all food and food ingredients, including prepared food, soft drinks, and dietary supplements.

                II.  However, even if a seller has more than seventy-five percent prepared food sales, four servings or more of food or food ingredients packaged for sale as a single item and sold for a single price are not "sold with utensils provided by the seller" unless the seller's customary practice for the package is to physically hand or otherwise deliver a utensil to the customer as part of the sales transaction. Whenever available, the number of servings included in a package of food or food ingredients must be determined based on the manufacturer's product label. If no label is available, the seller must reasonably determine the number of servings.

                III.  The seller must determine a single prepared food sales percentage annually for all the seller's establishments in the state based on the prior year of sales. The seller may elect to determine its prepared food sales percentage based either on the prior calendar year or on the prior fiscal year. A seller may not change its elected method for determining its prepared food percentage without the written consent of the department. The seller must determine its annual prepared food sales percentage as soon as possible after accounting records are available, but in no event later than ninety days after the beginning of the seller's calendar or fiscal year. A seller may make a good faith estimate of its first annual prepared food sales percentage if the seller's records for the prior year are not sufficient to allow the seller to calculate the prepared food sales percentage. The seller must adjust its good faith estimate prospectively if its relative sales of prepared foods in the first ninety days of operation materially depart from the seller's estimate.

        iii.  "Prepared food" does not include the following items, if sold without eating utensils provided by the seller:

            A.  Food sold by a seller whose proper primary NAICS classification is manufacturing in sector 311, except subsector 3118 (bakeries), as provided in the "North American industry classification system—United States, 2002";

            B.  Food sold in an unheated state by weight or volume as a single item; or

            C.  Bakery items. The term "bakery items" includes bread, rolls, buns, biscuits, bagels, croissants, pastries, donuts, Danish, cakes, tortes, pies, tarts, muffins, bars, cookies, or tortillas.

    d.  "Soft drinks" means nonalcoholic beverages that contain natural or artificial sweeteners. Soft drinks do not include beverages that contain: Milk or milk products; soy, rice, or similar milk substitutes; or greater than fifty percent of vegetable or fruit juice by volume.

3. Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the exemption of "food and food ingredients" provided in this section applies to food and food ingredients that are furnished, prepared, or served as meals:

    a.  Under a state administered nutrition program for the aged as provided for in the older Americans act (P.L. 95-478 Title III) and RCW 74.38.040(6);

    c.  That are provided to residents, sixty-two years of age or older, of a qualified low-income senior housing facility by the lessor or operator of the facility. The sale of a meal that is billed to both spouses of a marital community or both domestic partners of a domestic partnership meets the age requirement in this subsection (3)(c) if at least one of the spouses or domestic partners is at least sixty-two years of age. For purposes of this subsection, "qualified low-income senior housing facility" means a facility:

        i.  That meets the definition of a qualified low-income housing project under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 42 of the federal internal revenue code, as existing on August 1, 2009;

        iii.  For which the lessor or operator has at any time been entitled to claim a federal income tax credit under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 42 of the federal internal revenue code.

4. [Empty]

    a.  Subsection (1) of this section notwithstanding, the retail sale of food and food ingredients is subject to sales tax under RCW 82.08.020 if the food and food ingredients are sold through a vending machine. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, the selling price of food and food ingredients sold through a vending machine for purposes of RCW 82.08.020 is fifty-seven percent of the gross receipts.

    b.  For soft drinks, bottled water, and hot prepared food and food ingredients, other than food and food ingredients which are heated after they have been dispensed from the vending machine, the selling price is the total gross receipts of such sales divided by the sum of one plus the sales tax rate expressed as a decimal.

    c.  For tax collected under this subsection (4), the requirements that the tax be collected from the buyer and that the amount of tax be stated as a separate item are waived.

## 82.08.037 - Credits and refunds for bad debts.
1. A seller is entitled to a credit or refund for sales taxes previously paid on bad debts, as that term is used in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 166, as amended or renumbered as of January 1, 2003.

2. For purposes of this section, "bad debts" does not include:

    a.  Amounts due on property that remains in the possession of the seller until the full purchase price is paid;

    b.  Expenses incurred in attempting to collect debt; 

    c.  Debts sold or assigned by the seller to third parties, where the third party is without recourse against the seller; and

    d.  Repossessed property.

3. If a credit or refund of sales tax is taken for a bad debt and the debt is subsequently collected in whole or in part, the tax on the amount collected must be paid and reported on the return filed for the period in which the collection is made.

4. Payments on a previously claimed bad debt are applied first proportionally to the taxable price of the property or service and the sales or use tax thereon, and secondly to interest, service charges, and any other charges.

5. If the seller uses a certified service provider as defined in RCW 82.32.020 to administer its sales tax responsibilities, the certified service provider may claim, on behalf of the seller, the credit or refund allowed by this section. The certified service provider must credit or refund the full amount received to the seller.

6. The department must allow an allocation of bad debts among member states to the streamlined sales tax agreement, as defined in RCW 82.58.010(1), if the books and records of the person claiming bad debts support the allocation.

7. A person's right to claim a credit or refund under this section is not assignable. No person other than the original seller in the transaction that generated the bad debt or, as provided in subsection (5) of this section, a certified service provider, is entitled to claim a credit or refund under this section. If the original seller in the transaction that generated the bad debt has sold or assigned the debt instrument to a third party with recourse, the original seller may claim a credit or refund under this section only after the debt instrument is reassigned by the third party to the original seller.

## 82.08.050 - Buyer to pay, seller to collect tax—Statement of tax—Exception—Penalties.
1. The tax imposed in this chapter must be paid by the buyer to the seller. Each seller must collect from the buyer the full amount of the tax payable in respect to each taxable sale in accordance with the schedule of collections adopted by the department under the provisions of RCW 82.08.060.

2. The tax required by this chapter, to be collected by the seller, is deemed to be held in trust by the seller until paid to the department. Any seller who appropriates or converts the tax collected to the seller's own use or to any use other than the payment of the tax to the extent that the money required to be collected is not available for payment on the due date as prescribed in this chapter is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.

3. Except as otherwise provided in this section, if any seller fails to collect the tax imposed in this chapter or, having collected the tax, fails to pay it to the department in the manner prescribed by this chapter, whether such failure is the result of the seller's own acts or the result of acts or conditions beyond the seller's control, the seller is, nevertheless, personally liable to the state for the amount of the tax.

4. Sellers are not relieved from personal liability for the amount of the tax unless they maintain proper records of exempt or nontaxable transactions and provide them to the department when requested.

5. Sellers are not relieved from personal liability for the amount of tax if they fraudulently fail to collect the tax or if they solicit purchasers to participate in an unlawful claim of exemption.

6. Sellers are not relieved from personal liability for the amount of tax if they accept an exemption certificate from a purchaser claiming an entity-based exemption if:

    a.  The subject of the transaction sought to be covered by the exemption certificate is actually received by the purchaser at a location operated by the seller in Washington; and

    b.  Washington provides an exemption certificate that clearly and affirmatively indicates that the claimed exemption is not available in Washington. Graying out exemption reason types on a uniform form and posting it on the department's website is a clear and affirmative indication that the grayed out exemptions are not available.

7. [Empty]

    a.  Sellers are relieved from personal liability for the amount of tax if they obtain a fully completed exemption certificate or capture the relevant data elements required under the streamlined sales and use tax agreement within ninety days, or a longer period as may be provided by rule by the department, subsequent to the date of sale.

    b.  If the seller has not obtained an exemption certificate or all relevant data elements required under the streamlined sales and use tax agreement within the period allowed subsequent to the date of sale, the seller may, within one hundred twenty days, or a longer period as may be provided by rule by the department, subsequent to a request for substantiation by the department, either prove that the transaction was not subject to tax by other means or obtain a fully completed exemption certificate from the purchaser, taken in good faith.

    c.  Sellers are relieved from personal liability for the amount of tax if they obtain a blanket exemption certificate for a purchaser with which the seller has a recurring business relationship. The department may not request from a seller renewal of blanket exemption certificates or updates of exemption certificate information or data elements if there is a recurring business relationship between the buyer and seller. For purposes of this subsection (7)(c), a "recurring business relationship" means at least one sale transaction within a period of twelve consecutive months.

    d.  Sellers are relieved from personal liability for the amount of tax if they obtain a copy of a direct pay permit issued under RCW 82.32.087.

8. The amount of tax, until paid by the buyer to the seller or to the department, constitutes a debt from the buyer to the seller. Any seller who fails or refuses to collect the tax as required with intent to violate the provisions of this chapter or to gain some advantage or benefit, either direct or indirect, and any buyer who refuses to pay any tax due under this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor.

9. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the tax required by this chapter to be collected by the seller must be stated separately from the selling price in any sales invoice or other instrument of sale. On all retail sales through vending machines, the tax need not be stated separately from the selling price or collected separately from the buyer. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, for purposes of determining the tax due from the buyer to the seller and from the seller to the department it must be conclusively presumed that the selling price quoted in any price list, sales document, contract or other agreement between the parties does not include the tax imposed by this chapter. But if the seller advertises the price as including the tax or that the seller is paying the tax, the advertised price may not be considered the selling price.

10. Where a buyer has failed to pay to the seller the tax imposed by this chapter and the seller has not paid the amount of the tax to the department, the department may, in its discretion, proceed directly against the buyer for collection of the tax. If the department proceeds directly against the buyer for collection of the tax as authorized in this subsection, the department may add a penalty of ten percent of the unpaid tax to the amount of the tax due for failure of the buyer to pay the tax to the seller, regardless of when the tax may be collected by the department. In addition to the penalty authorized in this subsection, all of the provisions of chapter 82.32 RCW, including those relative to interest and penalties, apply. For the sole purpose of applying the various provisions of chapter 82.32 RCW, the twenty-fifth day of the month following the tax period in which the purchase was made will be considered as the due date of the tax.

11. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

    a.  "Exemption certificate" means documentation furnished by a buyer to a seller to claim an exemption from sales tax. An exemption certificate includes a reseller permit or other documentation authorized in RCW 82.04.470 furnished by a buyer to a seller to substantiate a wholesale sale.

    b.  "Seller" includes a certified service provider, as defined in RCW 82.32.020, acting as agent for the seller.

## 82.08.0531 - Marketplace facilitators—When deemed seller agents—Recordkeeping—Liability.
1. For purposes of this chapter and chapters 82.04 and 82.12 RCW, a marketplace facilitator is deemed to be an agent of any marketplace seller making retail sales through the marketplace facilitator's marketplace.

2. Beginning October 1, 2018, marketplace facilitators subject to a tax collection obligation under RCW 82.08.052 (1) or (2) must collect and remit to the department retail sales tax on all taxable retail sales made or facilitated by the marketplace facilitator, whether in its own right or as an agent of a marketplace seller, regardless of whether the marketplace seller is subject to a tax collection obligation under RCW 82.08.052 (1) or (2). Beginning January 1, 2020, the collection obligation of a marketplace facilitator under this chapter also applies to any other taxes and fees, as defined under RCW 82.02.260, that are imposed on a retail sale made or facilitated by the marketplace facilitator, whether in its own right or as an agent of a marketplace seller, regardless of whether the marketplace seller has a tax collection obligation under RCW 82.08.052 (1) or (2).

3. In addition to other applicable recordkeeping requirements, the department may require a marketplace facilitator to provide or make available to the department any information the department determines is reasonably necessary to enforce the provisions of this chapter and *chapter 82.13 RCW. Such information may include documentation of sales made by marketplace sellers through the marketplace facilitator's marketplace . The department may prescribe by rule the form and manner for providing this information.

4. [Empty]

    a.  Beginning July 1, 2019, to ensure that marketplace sellers have the necessary information to timely and accurately file their excise tax returns with the department pursuant to RCW 82.32.045, a marketplace facilitator must, at a minimum, provide each of its marketplace sellers with access, through a written report or other means, to gross sales information for all Washington sales made as an agent of the marketplace seller under this section during the immediately preceding month. Marketplace facilitators must provide such access within fifteen calendar days following the end of each month.

    b.  If a marketplace seller does not receive the gross sales information for all Washington sales through a marketplace facilitator, as required under (a) of this subsection (4), the marketplace seller may determine its business and occupation tax liability under chapter 82.04 RCW based on a reasonable method of estimating Washington sales as may be required or approved by the department.

    c.  For purposes of this subsection, "Washington sales" means any sale sourced to this state under RCW 82.32.730, regardless of whether the sale is a retail sale.

5. If a marketplace facilitator has fully complied with the requirements of subsection (4)(a) of this section, the marketplace facilitator is relieved of liability under this chapter and chapter 82.12 RCW for failure to collect the correct amount of tax to the extent that the marketplace facilitator can show to the department's satisfaction that the error was due to incorrect information given to the marketplace facilitator by the marketplace seller, unless the marketplace facilitator and marketplace seller are affiliated persons. Where the marketplace facilitator is relieved of liability under this subsection (5), the marketplace seller is solely liable for the amount of uncollected tax due.

6. [Empty]

    a.  Subject to the limits in (b) and (c) of this subsection (6), a marketplace facilitator that has fully complied with the requirements of subsection (4)(a) of this section is relieved of liability under this chapter and chapter 82.12 RCW for the failure to collect tax on taxable retail sales to the extent that the marketplace facilitator can show to the department's satisfaction that:

        i.  The taxable retail sale was made through the marketplace facilitator's marketplace;

        ii.  The taxable retail sale was made solely as the agent of a marketplace seller, and the marketplace facilitator and marketplace seller are not affiliated persons; and

        iii.  The failure to collect sales tax was not due to an error in sourcing the sale under RCW 82.32.730.

    b.  Liability relief for a marketplace facilitator under (a) of this subsection (6) for a calendar year is limited as follows:

        i.  For calendar year 2018, the liability relief may not exceed ten percent of the total tax due under this chapter and chapter 82.12 RCW on taxable retail sales facilitated by the marketplace facilitator as agent of a marketplace seller and sourced to this state under RCW 82.32.730 during the same calendar year.

        ii.  For calendar year 2019, the liability relief may not exceed five percent of the total tax due under this chapter and chapter 82.12 RCW on taxable retail sales by the marketplace facilitator as agent of a marketplace seller and sourced to this state under RCW 82.32.730 during the same calendar year.

        iii.  The provisions of this subsection (6) do not apply to retail sales made after December 31, 2019.

    c.  For purposes of this subsection (6), a retail sale is deemed to be facilitated by a marketplace facilitator when the marketplace facilitator either:

        i.  Accepts the order for the product;

        ii.  Communicates to the marketplace seller the buyer's offer to purchase the product;

        iii.  Accepts the buyer's payment for the product; or

        iv.  Delivers or arranges for delivery of the product.

    d.  Where the marketplace facilitator is relieved of liability under this subsection (6), the marketplace seller is also relieved of liability for the amount of uncollected tax due, subject to the limitations in subsection (7) of this section.

    e.  The department may by rule determine the manner in which a taxpayer may claim the liability relief provided under this subsection.

7. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a marketplace seller obligated to collect the taxes imposed under this chapter and chapter 82.12 RCW is not required to collect such taxes on all taxable retail sales through a marketplace operated by a marketplace facilitator if the marketplace seller has obtained documentation from the marketplace facilitator indicating that the marketplace facilitator is registered with the department and will collect all applicable taxes due under this chapter and chapter 82.12 RCW on all taxable retail sales made on behalf of the marketplace seller through the marketplace operated by the marketplace facilitator . The documentation required by this subsection (7) must be provided in a form and manner prescribed by or acceptable to the department. This subsection (7) does not relieve a marketplace seller from liability for uncollected taxes due under this chapter or chapter 82.12 RCW resulting from a marketplace facilitator's failure to collect the proper amount of tax due when the error was due to incorrect information given to the marketplace facilitator by the marketplace seller.

8. No class action may be brought against a marketplace facilitator in any court of this state on behalf of purchasers arising from or in any way related to an overpayment of sales or use tax collected by the marketplace facilitator, regardless of whether that claim is characterized as a tax refund claim. Nothing in this subsection affects a purchaser's right to seek a refund from the department as provided under chapter 82.32 RCW.

9. Nothing in this section affects the obligation of any purchaser to remit sales or use tax and any other applicable taxes and fees, as to any applicable taxable transaction in which the seller or the seller's agent does not collect and remit sales tax.

The department must provide written notice to the affected taxpayer of the department's request to the liquor and cannabis board.

    b.  Before the department may make a request to the liquor and cannabis board as authorized in (a) of this subsection (1), the department must have provided the taxpayer with at least seven calendar days prior written notice. This notice must inform the taxpayer that the department intends to request that the liquor and cannabis board suspend the taxpayer's spirits license or licenses and refuse to renew any existing license of the taxpayer or issue any new spirits license to the taxpayer unless, within seven calendar days of the date of the notice, the taxpayer submits any unfiled tax returns for reporting spirits taxes and remits full payment of its outstanding spirits tax liability to the department or negotiates payment arrangements for the unpaid spirits taxes. The notice required by this subsection (1)(b) must include information listing any unfiled tax returns; the amount of unpaid spirits taxes, including any applicable penalties and interest; who to contact to inquire about payment arrangements; and that the taxpayer may seek administrative review by the department of the notice, and the deadline for seeking such review.

4. For purposes of this section:

    a.  Packaging such as containers, boxes, sacks, bags, and bottles, or other materials such as wrapping, labels, tags, and instruction guides, that accompany the retail sale of the products and are incidental or immaterial to the retail sale thereof. Examples of packaging that are incidental or immaterial include grocery sacks, shoeboxes, dry cleaning garment bags, and express delivery envelopes and boxes;

    b.  The retail sale of services where one service is provided that is essential to the use or receipt of a second service and the first service is provided exclusively in connection with the second service and the true object of the transaction is the second service; or

    c.  A transaction that includes taxable products and nontaxable products and the purchase price or sales price of the taxable products is de minimis;

        i.  As used in this subsection (4)(c), de minimis means the seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable products is ten percent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled products;

        ii.  Sellers shall use either the purchase price or the sales price of the products to determine if the taxable products are de minimis;

        iii.  Sellers shall use the full term of a service contract to determine if the taxable products are de minimis; or

    d.  The retail sale of exempt tangible personal property and taxable tangible personal property where:

        i.  The transaction includes food and food ingredients, drugs, durable medical equipment, mobility enhancing equipment, over-the-counter drugs, prosthetic devices, all as defined in this chapter, or medical supplies; and

## 82.08.195 - Bundled transactions—Tax imposed.
1. Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, a bundled transaction is subject to the tax imposed by RCW 82.08.020 if the retail sale of any of its component products would be subject to the tax imposed by RCW 82.08.020.

2. The transactions described in RCW 82.08.190(4) (a) and (b) are subject to the tax imposed by RCW 82.08.020 if the service that is the true object of the transaction is subject to the tax imposed by RCW 82.08.020. If the service that is the true object of the transaction is not subject to the tax imposed by RCW 82.08.020, the transaction is not subject to the tax imposed by RCW 82.08.020.

3. The transaction described in RCW 82.08.190(4)(c) is not subject to the tax imposed by RCW 82.08.020.

4. The transaction described in RCW 82.08.190(4)(d) is not subject to the tax imposed by RCW 82.08.020.

5. In the case of a bundled transaction that includes any of the following: Telecommunications service, ancillary service, internet access, or audio or video programming service:

    b.  If the price is attributable to products that are subject to tax at different tax rates, the total price is attributable to the products subject to the tax at the highest tax rate unless the seller can identify by reasonable and verifiable standards the portion of the price attributable to the products subject to the tax imposed by RCW 82.08.020 at the lower rate from its books and records that are kept in the regular course of business for other purposes including, but not limited to, nontax purposes.

6. The tax imposed by RCW 82.08.020 does not apply in respect to a bundled transaction consisting entirely of the sale of services or of services and prepared food, if the sale is to a resident, sixty-two years of age or older, of a qualified low-income senior housing facility by the lessor or operator of the facility. A single bundled transaction involving both spouses of a marital community or both domestic partners of a domestic partnership meets the age requirement in this subsection if at least one of the spouses or domestic partners is at least sixty-two years of age. For purposes of this subsection, "qualified low-income senior housing facility" has the same meaning as in RCW 82.08.0293.

7. In the case of the sale of a code that provides a purchaser with the right to obtain more than one digital product or one or more digital products and other products or services, and all of the products and services, digital or otherwise, to be obtained through the use of the code do not have the same sales and use tax treatment, for purposes of the tax imposed by RCW 82.08.020:

    a.  The transaction is deemed to be the sale of the products and services to be obtained through the use of the code; and

    b.  [Empty]

        i.  The tax imposed by RCW 82.08.020 applies to the entire selling price of the code, except as provided in (b)(ii) of this subsection (7).
