# House Bill 1010

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/House%20Bills/1010.xml)
## Section 1
It is the intent of the legislature to ensure Washington's transportation infrastructure can support the safe and efficient movement of people and goods. Primary funding for transportation infrastructure efforts comes from the state portion of the fuel tax and fees for registering motor vehicles, which have economic and political vulnerabilities that can limit their reliability. The legislature intends to establish an additional funding source that would not be subject to bonding, and therefore offer greater flexibility and efficiency in addressing transportation infrastructure needs. The legislature finds that dedicating the sales tax revenue on vehicle sales to the transportation budget would reinforce the state's ability to provide the twenty-first century transportation system that the people of Washington can and should expect.

## Section 4
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [46.68](/rcw/46_motor_vehicles/46.68_disposition_of_revenue.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/46_motor_vehicles/46.68_disposition_of_revenue.md) for context.

3. Part of the purpose in the allocation of additional resources from the sales and use tax revenues on new and used vehicles into the transportation preservation and maintenance account pursuant to RCW 82.08.020 and 82.12.020 is to lower the overall reliance on debt financing for transportation projects and infrastructure.
