<ol>
<li>
<p>When proposed by citizen petition or by local government resolution as provided in this section, a ballot proposition authorizing the creation of a metropolitan park district must be submitted by resolution to the voters of the area proposed to be included in the district at any general election, or at any special election which may be called for that purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ballot proposition must be submitted if the governing body of each city in which all or a portion of the proposed district is located, and the legislative authority of each county in which all or a portion of the proposed district is located within the unincorporated portion of the county, each adopts a resolution submitting the proposition to create a metropolitan park district.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As an alternative to the method provided under subsection (2) of this section, the ballot proposition must be submitted if a petition proposing creation of a metropolitan park district is submitted to the county auditor of each county in which all or a portion of the proposed district is located that is signed by at least fifteen percent of the registered voters residing in the area to be included within the proposed district. Where the petition is for creation of a district in more than one county, the petition must be filed with the county auditor of the county having the greater area of the proposed district, and a copy filed with each other county auditor of the other counties covering the proposed district.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Territory by virtue of its annexation to any city whose territory lies entirely within a park district are deemed to be within the limits of the metropolitan park district. Such an extension of a park district's boundaries is not subject to review by a boundary review board independent of the board's review of the city annexation of territory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A city, county, or contiguous group of cities or counties proposing or approving a petition regarding formation of a metropolitan park district may limit the purpose and may limit the taxing powers of such proposed metropolitan park district in its resolution in cases where the metropolitan park district is being formed for specifically identified facilities referenced in (a) of this subsection. The ballot proposition must reflect such limitations as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A city, county, or contiguous group of cities or counties may limit the proposed district's purposes to providing the funds necessary to acquire, construct, renovate, expand, operate, maintain, and provide programming for specifically identified public parks or recreational facilities that are otherwise authorized by law for metropolitan park districts. The ballot proposition must specifically identify those public parks or recreational facilities to be funded, which identification may be made by referencing a metropolitan park district plan that has been approved by the legislative authority of the city, county, or contiguous group of cities or counties proposing the formation of the district;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A city, county, or contiguous group of cities or counties may limit the maximum levy rate that is available to such metropolitan park district to any levy rate that does not exceed the aggregate rate set forth under RCW 35.61.210(1). The ballot proposition must state the maximum regular levy rate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing herein prevents a city, county, or contiguous group of cities or counties from proposing formation of a metropolitan park district that is not limited under subsection (5) of this section.</p>

<p>Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section for review by a boundary review board, the ballot proposition authorizing creation of a metropolitan park district that is submitted to voters for their approval or rejection shall appear on the ballot of the next general election or at the next special election date specified under RCW 29A.04.330 occurring sixty or more days after the last resolution proposing the creation of the park district is adopted or the date the county auditor certifies that the petition proposing the creation of the park district contains sufficient valid signatures. Where the petition or copy thereof is filed with two or more county auditors in the case of a proposed district in two or more counties, the county auditors shall confer and issue a joint certification upon finding that the required number of signatures on the petition has been obtained.</p>

<li>
<p>Where the proposed district is located wholly or in part in a county in which a boundary review board has been created, notice of the proposal to create a metropolitan park district shall be filed with the boundary review board as provided under RCW 36.93.090 and the special election at which a ballot proposition authorizing creation of the park district shall be held on the special election date specified under RCW 29A.04.330 that is sixty or more days after the date the boundary review board is deemed to have approved the proposal, approves the proposal, or modifies and approves the proposal. The creation of a metropolitan park district is not subject to review by a boundary review board if the proposed district only includes one or more cities and in such cases the special election at which a ballot proposition authorizing creation of the park district shall be held as if a boundary review board does not exist in the county or counties.</p>

<p>The board of park commissioners may levy or cause to be levied a general tax on all the property located in said park district each year not to exceed fifty cents per thousand dollars of assessed value of the property in such park district. In addition, the board of park commissioners may levy or cause to be levied a general tax on all property located in said park district each year not to exceed twenty-five cents per thousand dollars of assessed valuation. Although park districts are authorized to impose two separate regular property tax levies, the levies are considered to be a single levy for purposes of the limitation provided for in chapter 84.55 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maximum levy rate of a metropolitan park district formed subject to the limitations set forth in RCW 35.61.020(5) must be the levy rate set forth in the ballot proposition. At any time after the initial formation of a district subject to a limitation under RCW 35.61.020(5), the board of metropolitan park commissioners may submit to the voters of the district at a general or special election a proposition to alter such maximum regular levy rate, which proposition becomes effective only upon approval by a majority of the votes cast on the proposition. The limitations provided in chapter 84.55 RCW do not apply in the first year after the approval of any proposition under this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board is hereby authorized to levy a general tax in excess of its regular property tax levy or levies when authorized so to do at a special election conducted in accordance with and subject to all the requirements of the Constitution and laws of the state now in force or hereafter enacted governing the limitation of tax levies. The board is hereby authorized to call a special election for the purpose of submitting to the qualified voters of the park district a proposition to levy a tax in excess of the regular levy rates authorized for the district under subsection (1) or (2) of this section. The manner of submitting any such proposition, of certifying the same, and of giving or publishing notice thereof, must be as provided by law for the submission of propositions by cities, towns, or counties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board must include in its general tax levy for each year a sufficient sum to pay the interest on all outstanding bonds and may include a sufficient amount to create a sinking fund for the redemption of all outstanding bonds. The levy must be certified to the proper county officials for collection the same as other general taxes and, for any metropolitan park district for which the county treasurer serves as the ex officio treasurer, when collected, the general tax must be placed in a separate fund in the office of the county treasurer to be known as the &quot;metropolitan park district fund&quot; and disbursed under RCW 36.29.010(1) and 39.58.750.</p>
