<ol>
<li>
<p>Local fire departments in the state of Washington serve as the frontline responders to wildland fires. The fire chief of each local fire department with jurisdiction over wildland fires is tasked with making rapid decisions, especially during the summer months when weather conditions can cause fires to rapidly enlarge. Flashy fuels, especially during times of low humidity, can be ignited by a single spark and erupt into a rapidly moving incident that can quickly destroy rangelands, ripe dryland crops, and timberlands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local fire departments often hold contracts with local aviation companies that are certified to fly and drop fire retardants and water to suppress or extinguish wildland fires quickly. Many of these aviation companies also serve the state fire agency and federal fire agencies during state mobilization events. The use of aviation assets by trained air operations commands has proven to be a valuable tool to prevent many wildland fires from requiring the response of state mobilization and prevent the deployment of state and federal fire agencies and their mobilization partner agencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further, the strategic use of aviation assets in initial attack, or at times when conditions on the ground may warrant additional air support, can prevent fires from becoming uncontrollable. Local fire departments that use aviation assets on initial attack can prevent most fires from requiring a state mobilization. Providing financial assurances for local fire departments to deploy aviation assets will provide greater protection to our state's natural resources and air quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to establish an office to administer a pool of funding to support the use of local aviation companies certified and trained to operate in wildland fires and drop fire retardant or water to suppress or extinguish fires as an initial attack strategy. Deployment and air operations command will be conducted at the direction of trained air operations commanders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to allow reimbursement for invoices of an aviation service utilized for early fire suppression in order to provide assurance that a local fire department will have sufficient financial capacity to effectively control wildland fires throughout the length of the fire season. Having assurance that local fire departments can afford to use aircraft under conditions that would warrant their use and at the discretion of the local fire department chief will create incentives to utilize aircraft more quickly in order to rapidly suppress the fire and minimize damage to lands, resources, and structures, and to protect regional air quality during the fire season.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The wildfire response, forest restoration, and community resilience account is created in the state treasury. All receipts from moneys directed to the account must be deposited in the account. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Expenditures from the account may be used only for carrying out the purposes of chapter 298, Laws of 2021 and for no other purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expenditures from the account may be made to state agencies, federally recognized tribes, local governments, fire and conservation districts, nonprofit organizations, forest collaboratives, and small forestland owners, consistent with the 20-year forest health strategic plan, the wildland fire protection 10-year strategic plan,  the Washington state forest action plan**, and chapter 89.---RCW (the new chapter created in section 6 of this act)**.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The wildfire response, forest restoration, and community resilience account may only be used to monitor, track, and implement the following purposes:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Fire preparedness activities consistent with the goals contained in the state's wildland fire protection 10-year strategic plan including, but not limited to, funding for firefighting capacity and investments in ground and aerial firefighting resources, equipment, and technology, and the development and implementation of a wildland fire aviation support plan in order to expand and improve the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of the department's wildland fire aviation program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fire prevention activities to restore and improve forest health and reduce vulnerability to drought, insect infestation, disease, and other threats to healthy forests including, but not limited to, silvicultural treatments, seedling development, thinning and prescribed fire, and postfire recovery activities to stabilize and prevent unacceptable degradation to natural and cultural resources and minimize threats to life and property resulting from the effects of a wildfire.
