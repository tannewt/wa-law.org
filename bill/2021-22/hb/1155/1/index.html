<p>The tax authorized in this section is in addition to any other taxes authorized by law and must be collected from those persons who are taxable by the state under chapters 82.08 and 82.12 RCW upon the occurrence of any taxable event within the county. The rate of tax may not exceed two-tenths of one percent of the selling price in the case of sales tax, or value of the article used, in the case of a use tax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moneys received from any tax imposed under this section must be used solely for the purpose of providing funds for costs associated with financing, design, acquisition, construction, equipping, operating, maintaining, remodeling, repairing, reequipping, and improvement of emergency communication systems and facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Counties are authorized to develop joint ventures to collocate emergency communication systems and facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to submitting the tax authorization in subsection (2) of this section to the voters in a county that provides emergency communication services to a governmental agency pursuant to a contract, the parties to the contract must review and negotiate or affirm the terms of the contract.</p>

<p><strong>If, at any time after the approval and imposition of the tax authorized under this section, any noncharter county with a population of 500,000 or more and any city therein meet the population thresholds identified in (a) of this subsection (7), the county must enter into an interlocal agreement with the city to determine distribution of the revenue provided in this section.</strong></p>

<p><strong>A city may notify the legislative authority of the county in which it resides that the city believes that the population thresholds identified in (a) of this subsection (7) have been reached and may request that the county enter into an interlocal agreement as provided in (b) of this subsection (7). If the city and the county fail to enter into an interlocal agreement within 90 days of the city's request, then the city or county may seek equitable apportionment of the tax authorized under this section in the county's superior court. If the city and the county fail to enter into an interlocal agreement within six months of the city's request, then any tax collected under this section within the city must be returned to the city, and any apportionment that the city received under this section in excess of what was collected in the city must be returned to the county. In no circumstances may an agreement be entered into, or an apportionment made, that impairs any existing bond or contract secured by the revenue provided in this section.</strong></p>
