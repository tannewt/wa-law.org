1. Passenger motor vehicles used primarily for  ride sharing and ride sharing for persons with special transportation needs, as defined in RCW 46.74.010, are not subject to the motor vehicle excise tax authorized under this chapter if the vehicles are used as ride‑sharing vehicles for thirty‑six consecutive months beginning from the date of purchase.

2. To qualify for the motor vehicle excise tax exemption for  ride-sharing vehicles, passenger motor vehicles must:

    a. Have a seating capacity of **three** or **more** passengers, including the driver;

    b. Be used for  ride sharing;

    c. Be operated either within:

        i. The state's eight largest counties that are required to develop commute trip reduction plans as directed by chapter 70A.15 RCW;

        ii. **Other** counties, or cities and towns within those counties, that elect to adopt and implement a commute trip reduction plan; **or**

        iii. **Other counties, where the vehicle is registered with or operated by a public transportation agency;** and

    d. Meet at least one of the following conditions:

        i. The vehicle must be operated by a public transportation agency for the **benefit of the** general public;

        ii. The vehicle must be used by a major employer, as defined in RCW 70A.15.4010 as an element of its commute trip reduction program for their employees; or

        iii. The vehicle must be owned and operated by individual employees and must be registered either with the employer as part of its commute trip reduction program or with a public transportation agency . Individual employee owned and operated motor vehicles will require certification that the vehicle is registered with a major employer or a public transportation agency. Major employers who own and operate motor vehicles for their employees must certify that the  ride-sharing arrangement conforms to a carpool/vanpool element contained within their commute trip reduction program.

3. The registered owner of a passenger motor vehicle described in subsection (2) of this section:

    a. Shall notify the department upon the termination of the primary use of the vehicle in  ride sharing or ride sharing for persons with special transportation needs; and

    b. Is liable for the motor vehicle excise tax imposed under this chapter, prorated on the remaining months for which the vehicle is registered.

## 82.44.035 - Valuation of vehicles.
1. For the purpose of determining any locally imposed motor vehicle excise tax, the value of a truck or trailer shall be the latest purchase price of the vehicle, excluding applicable federal excise taxes, state and local sales or use taxes, transportation or shipping costs, or preparatory or delivery costs, multiplied by the following percentage based on year of service of the vehicle since last sale. The latest purchase year shall be considered the first year of service.

2. The reissuance of a certificate of title and registration certificate for a truck or trailer because of the installation of body or special equipment shall be treated as a sale, and the value of the truck or trailer at that time, as determined by the department from such information as may be available, shall be considered the latest purchase price.

3. For the purpose of determining any locally imposed motor vehicle excise tax, the value of a vehicle other than a truck or trailer shall be eighty-five percent of the manufacturer's base suggested retail price of the vehicle when first offered for sale as a new vehicle, excluding any optional equipment, applicable federal excise taxes, state and local sales or use taxes, transportation or shipping costs, or preparatory or delivery costs, multiplied by the applicable percentage listed in this subsection (3) based on year of service of the vehicle.

If the manufacturer's base suggested retail price is unavailable or otherwise unascertainable at the time of initial registration in this state, the department shall determine a value equivalent to a manufacturer's base suggested retail price as follows:

    a. The department shall determine a value using any information that may be available, including any guidebook, report, or compendium of recognized standing in the automotive industry or the selling price and year of sale of the vehicle. The department may use an appraisal by the county assessor. In valuing a vehicle for which the current value or selling price is not indicative of the value of similar vehicles of the same year and model, the department shall establish a value that more closely represents the average value of similar vehicles of the same year and model. The value determined in this subsection (3)(a) shall be divided by the applicable percentage listed in (b) of this subsection (3) to establish a value equivalent to a manufacturer's base suggested retail price and this value shall be multiplied by eighty-five percent.

    b. The year the vehicle is offered for sale as a new vehicle shall be considered the first year of service.

For vehicles registered under chapter 46.87 RCW, proportional registration, and for vehicle dealer plates issued under chapter 46.70 RCW, the registration year is the period provided in those chapters. However, the tax shall in no case be less than two dollars except for proportionally registered vehicles.

2. A vehicle is deemed registered for the first time in this state when the vehicle was not previously registered by this state for the registration year immediately preceding the registration year in which the application for registration is made or when the vehicle has been registered in another jurisdiction subsequent to any prior registration in this state.

3. An additional tax may not be imposed under this chapter on any vehicle when the certificate of title is being transferred if the tax has already been paid for the registration year or fraction of a registration year in which transfer of ownership occurs.

## 82.44.135 - Local government must contract with department of licensing.
1. Before a local government subject to this chapter may impose a motor vehicle excise tax, the local government must contract with the department for the collection of the tax. The department may charge a reasonable amount, not to exceed one percent of tax collections, or two and one-half percent during the 2019-2021 biennium, for the administration and collection of the tax.

2. For fiscal year 2021, the department shall charge a minimum of seven million eight hundred two thousand dollars, which is the reasonable amount aimed at achieving full cost recovery for the administration and collection of a motor vehicle excise tax. The amount of the full reimbursement for the administration and collection of the motor vehicle excise tax must be deducted before distributing any revenues to a regional transit authority. Any reimbursement to ensure full cost recovery beyond the amount specified in this subsection may be negotiated between the department and the regional transit authority if full cost recovery has not been achieved, or if based on emergent issues.

## 82.44.195 - Transportation infrastructure account—Highway infrastructure account—Finding—Intent—Purpose—1996 c 262.
The legislature finds that new financing mechanisms are necessary to provide greater flexibility and additional funds for needed transportation infrastructure projects in the state. The creation of a financing mechanism, like the one contained in section 350 of the national highway system designation act of 1995, P.L. 104-59, relating to a state infrastructure bank program, will enable the state and local jurisdictions to use federal, state, local, or private funds to construct surface transportation projects for various modes of transportation. It is the intent of the legislature that accounts be created in the state treasury and dedicated funding sources be established to generate revenue to support transportation projects financed with the proceeds of bonds or other financial instruments issued against this dedicated revenue and other revenues which may be available to these accounts. P.L. 104-59 allows the deposit of certain federal highway and transit funds into these accounts to leverage other forms of investment in transportation infrastructure by expanding the eligible uses of the federal funds. Other public and private entities may also deposit funds into these accounts to leverage transportation investments. The purpose of chapter 262, Laws of 1996 is to provide, from these accounts, authorization for loans, grants, or other means of assistance, in amounts equal to all or part of the cost, to public or private entities building surface transportation facilities in this state. It is the further intent of the legislature that projects representing critical mobility or economic development needs and involving various transportation modes and jurisdictions receive top priority in the use of these funds. Funds from the accounts created in chapter 262, Laws of 1996 may be used to support the issuance of public or private debt, to provide credit enhancement for such debt, for direct loans to public or private entities, or for other purposes necessary to facilitate investment in surface transportation facilities in this state.
