# House Bill 1365

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/House%20Bills/1365.xml)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the importance of internet-accessible learning devices to the ability of students to receive a modern education. When Washington schools closed in March 2020, school districts shifted quickly to offering education in an online environment. Teachers adapted their lessons for videoconferencing platforms and arranged for students to submit homework via email. However, distance learning amplified digital deserts and disparities among students that will only continue to grow for the foreseeable future.
The legislature finds that low-income and Black Washingtonians face disproportionate barriers to accessing internet in their homes. Recent census household pulse survey data shows that a computer is rarely or never available for a child's educational use for 59% of households experiencing poverty and 80% of Black households in Washington state.
Furthermore, the legislature finds that accessing the internet requires more than just a computer. For families and students to be truly connected, they need the digital literacy, skills, and support to use their device and navigate the web.
Therefore, the legislature intends to provide every student and every educator in Washington with an appropriate learning device as well as the necessary digital literacy support to ensure digital equity and access.

1. **Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, any** pupil who defaces or otherwise injures any school property, or property belonging to a school contractor, employee, or another student, is subject to suspension and punishment. If any property of the school district, a contractor of the district, an employee, or another student has been lost or willfully cut, defaced, or injured, the school district may withhold the grades, diploma, and transcripts of the pupil responsible for the damage or loss until the pupil or the pupil's parent or guardian has paid for the damages. If the student is suspended, the student may not be readmitted until the student or parents or legal guardian has made payment in full or until directed by the superintendent of schools. If the property damaged is a school bus owned and operated by or contracted to any school district, a student suspended for the damage may not be permitted to enter or ride any school bus until the student or parent or legal guardian has made payment in full or until directed by the superintendent. When the pupil and parent or guardian are unable to pay for the damages, the school district shall provide a program of voluntary work for the pupil in lieu of the payment of monetary damages. Upon completion of voluntary work the grades, diploma, and transcripts of the pupil shall be released. The parent or guardian of such pupil shall be liable for damages as otherwise provided by law.

2. Before any penalties are assessed under this section, a school district board of directors shall adopt procedures which insure that pupils' rights to due process are protected. **If the school property is a learning device, as defined in RCW 28A.650.010, the penalties under subsection (1) of this section may not include withholding of the pupil's grades, diploma, or transcripts, and unless the pupil willfully damaged or lost the learning device, the penalties may not include requiring the pupil to pay monetary damages or to perform voluntary work in lieu of such payment.**

3. If the department of social and health services or a child-placing agency licensed by the department has been granted custody of a child, that child's records, if requested by the department or agency, are not to be withheld for nonpayment of school fees or any other reason.
