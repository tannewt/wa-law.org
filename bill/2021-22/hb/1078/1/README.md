The secretary of state or county auditor shall send to the person at his or her last known voter registration address and at the department of corrections, if the person is **serving a sentence of total confinement under the jurisdiction** of the department, a notice of the proposed cancellation and an explanation of the requirements for  restoring the right to vote and reregistering. To the extent possible, the secretary of state shall time the comparison required by this subsection to allow notice and cancellation of voting rights for ineligible voters prior to a primary or general election.

3. For the purposes of this section,

a sentence of **total** confinement

**does not include confinement imposed as a sanction for a community custody violation under RCW 9.94A.633(1)**.
