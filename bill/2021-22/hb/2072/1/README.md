## Section 1
> This section modifies existing section [65.20.010](/rcw/65_recording_registration_and_legal_publication/65.20_classification_of_manufactured_homes.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/65_recording_registration_and_legal_publication/65.20_classification_of_manufactured_homes.md) for context.

The legislature recognizes that confusion exists regarding the classification of manufactured homes as personal or real property. This confusion is increased because manufactured homes are treated as vehicles in some parts of state statutes, however these homes are often used as residences to house persons residing in the state of Washington. This results in a variety of problems, including: (1) Creating confusion as to the creation, perfection, and priority of security interests in manufactured homes; (2) making it more difficult and expensive to obtain financing and title insurance; (3) making it more difficult to utilize manufactured homes as an affordable housing option; and (4) increasing the risk of problems for and losses to the consumer. Therefore the purpose of this chapter is to clarify the type of property manufactured homes are, particularly relating to security interests, and to **improve the** statutory process to make the manufactured home real property  when the home is affixed to land owned by the homeowner.


## Section 2
> This section modifies existing section [65.20.020](/rcw/65_recording_registration_and_legal_publication/65.20_classification_of_manufactured_homes.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/65_recording_registration_and_legal_publication/65.20_classification_of_manufactured_homes.md) for context.

Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter.

1. "Affixed" means that the manufactured home is installed in accordance with the installation standards in state law.

2. "Department" means the department of licensing.

3. "Eliminating the title" means to cancel an existing certificate of title issued by this state or a foreign jurisdiction or to waive the certificate of title required in chapter 46.12 RCW and recording the appropriate documents in the county real property records pursuant to this chapter. **"Eliminating the title" does not mean the designation of a manufactured home as real property as provided in RCW 65.20.030(2).**

4. "Homeowner" means the owner of a manufactured home.

5. "Land" means real property excluding the manufactured home.

6. "Manufactured home" or "mobile home" means a structure, designed and constructed to be transportable in one or more sections and is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used as a dwelling with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities that include plumbing, heating, and electrical systems contained therein. The structure must comply with the national mobile home construction and safety standards act of 1974 as adopted by chapter 43.22 RCW if applicable. "Manufactured home" does not include a modular home. A structure which met the definition of a "manufactured home" at the time of manufacture is still considered to meet this definition notwithstanding that it is no longer transportable.

7. "Owner" means, when referring to a manufactured home that is titled, the person who is the registered owner. When referring to a mobile home that is untitled pursuant to this chapter, the owner is the person who owns the land.

10. "Security interest" means an interest in property to secure payment of a loan made by a secured party to a borrower.

11. "Title" or "titled" means a certificate of title issued pursuant to chapter 46.12 RCW.
