<p>The legislature recognizes that confusion exists regarding the classification of manufactured homes as personal or real property. This confusion is increased because manufactured homes are treated as vehicles in some parts of state statutes, however these homes are often used as residences to house persons residing in the state of Washington. This results in a variety of problems, including: (1) Creating confusion as to the creation, perfection, and priority of security interests in manufactured homes; (2) making it more difficult and expensive to obtain financing and title insurance; (3) making it more difficult to utilize manufactured homes as an affordable housing option; and (4) increasing the risk of problems for and losses to the consumer. Therefore the purpose of this chapter is to clarify the type of property manufactured homes are, particularly relating to security interests, and to <strong>improve the</strong> statutory process to make the manufactured home real property  when the home is affixed to land owned by the homeowner.</p>
<h2 id="6520020---definitions"><strong>65.20.020 - Definitions.</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#6520020---definitions">¶</a></h2>

<p>&quot;Homeowner&quot; means the owner of a manufactured home.</p>

<p><strong>Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, when</strong> a manufactured home is sold or transferred on or after March 1, 1990, and when all ownership in the manufactured home is transferred through the sale or other transfer of the manufactured home to new owners, the manufactured home shall be real property when the new owners eliminate the title pursuant to this chapter. The manufactured home shall not be real property in any form, including fixture law, unless the title is eliminated under this chapter. Where any person who owned a used manufactured home on March 1, 1990, continues to own the manufactured home on or after March 1, 1990, the interests and rights of owners, secured parties, lienholders, and others in the manufactured home shall be based on the law prior to March 1, 1990, except where the owner voluntarily eliminates the title to the manufactured home by complying with this chapter. If the title to the manufactured home is eliminated under this chapter, the manufactured home shall be treated the same as a site-built structure and ownership shall be based on ownership of the real property through real property law. If the title to the manufactured home has not been eliminated under this chapter, ownership shall be based on chapter 46.12 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When a new manufactured home is sold by a manufacturer or dealer on or after January 1, 2023, and when all ownership in the manufactured home is transferred through the sale or other transfer of the manufactured home to new owners, the manufactured home shall be real property when affixed to a permanent foundation to land owned by the homeowner and shall be treated the same as a site-built structure and ownership shall be based on ownership of the real property through real property law. The manufactured home must be recorded in the county real property records of the county where the real property to which the home is affixed is located.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of perfecting and realizing upon security interests, manufactured homes shall always be treated as follows: (a) If the <strong>manufactured home does not meet the criteria for real property</strong> under this chapter, security interests in the manufactured home shall be perfected only under chapter 62A.9A RCW in the case of a manufactured home held as inventory by a manufacturer or dealer or chapter 46.12 RCW in all other cases, and the lien shall be treated as securing personal property for purposes of realizing upon the security interest; or (b) if the title has been eliminated <strong>or a title has not been issued</strong> under this chapter, a separate security interest in the manufactured home shall not exist, and the manufactured home shall only be secured as part of the real property through a mortgage, deed of trust, or real estate contract.</p>

<p>If a manufactured home <strong>that does not meet the criteria of real property under RCW 65.20.030(2)</strong> is affixed to land that is owned by the homeowner, the homeowner may apply to the department to have the title to the manufactured home eliminated. The application package shall consist of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An affidavit, in the form prescribed by the department, signed by all the owners of the manufactured home and containing:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The date;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The names of all of the owners of record of the manufactured home;</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>The names of all secured parties in the manufactured home; and</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certificate of title for the manufactured home, or the manufacturer's statement of origin in the case of a new manufactured home.

</li>
<li>
<p>A certification by the local government indicating that the manufactured home is affixed to the land;</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>The department shall approve the application for elimination of the title when all requirements listed in RCW 65.20.040 have been satisfied and the registered and legal owners of the manufactured home have consented to the elimination of the title. After approval, the department shall have the approved application recorded in the county or counties in which the land is located and on which the manufactured home is affixed.</p>
<p>The county auditor shall record the approved application, and any other form prescribed by the department, in the county real property records. The manufactured home shall then be treated as real property as if it were a site-built structure. Removal of the manufactured home from the land is prohibited unless the procedures set forth in RCW 65.20.070 are complied with.</p>
<p>The department shall cancel the title after verification that the county auditor has recorded the appropriate documents, and the department shall maintain a record of each manufactured home title eliminated under this chapter by vehicle identification number. The title is deemed eliminated on the date the appropriate documents are recorded by the county auditor.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the owner, secured parties, and others to take action as necessary to protect their respective interests in conjunction with the elimination of the title or reissuance of a previously eliminated title.</p>
<p>A manufactured home whose title has been eliminated shall be conveyed by deed or real estate contract and shall only be transferred together with the property to which it is affixed, unless procedures described in RCW 65.20.070 are completed.</p>
<p>Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require a lender to consent to the elimination of the title of a manufactured home, or to retitling a manufactured home under RCW 65.20.070. The obligation of the lender to consent is governed solely by the agreement between the lender and the owner of the manufactured home. Absent any express written contractual obligation, a lender may withhold consent in the lender's sole discretion. In addition, the homeowner shall comply with all reasonable requirements imposed by a lender for obtaining consent, and a lender may charge a reasonable fee for processing a request for consent.</p>
