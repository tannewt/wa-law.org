<p>The legislature finds and declares that it is of importance to the people of Washington state to live in a healthy environment and to expect a minimum standard of quality in health care. The legislature further finds that the social and economic vitality of the state depends on a healthy and productive population. The legislature further declares where it is a duty of the state to assure a healthy environment and minimum standards of quality in health care facilities and among health care professionals, the ultimate responsibility for a healthy society lies with the citizens themselves.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the legislature recognizes the need for a strong, clear focus on health issues in state government and among state health agencies to give expression to the needs of individual citizens and local communities as they seek to preserve the public health. It is the intent of the legislature to form such focus by creating a single department in state government with the primary responsibilities for the preservation of public health, monitoring health care costs, the maintenance of minimal standards for quality in health care delivery, and the general oversight and planning for all the state's activities as they relate to the health of its citizenry.</p>
<p>Further, it is the intent of the legislature to improve illness and injury prevention and health promotion, and restore the confidence of the citizenry in the efficient and accountable expenditure of public funds on health activities that further the mission of the agency via grants and contracts, and to ensure that this new health agency delivers quality health services in an efficient, effective, and economical manner that is faithful and responsive to policies established by the legislature.</p>

<li>
<p>The department shall require hospitals with emergency departments to submit emergency department patient care information, which must be collected, maintained, analyzed, and disseminated by the department. The department shall also accept other data types submitted voluntarily as approved by the department. The data must be collected in a way that allows automated reporting by electronic transmission. Emergency departments submitting data must be able to obtain their data and aggregate regional and statewide data from the collection system within thirty minutes of submission of a query for the data once the data is available in the system. The department may, if deemed cost-effective and efficient, contract with a private entity for any or all parts of data collection, maintenance, analysis, and dissemination.

<p>The legislature finds that it is difficult for consumers of health care services to determine the quality of health care prior to purchase or utilization of medical care. The legislature also finds that accountability is a key component in promoting quality assurance and quality improvement throughout the health care delivery system, including public programs. Quality assurance and improvement standards are necessary to promote the public interest, contribute to cost efficiencies, and improve the ability of consumers to ascertain quality health care purchases.</p>
<p>The legislature intends to have consumers, health carriers, health care providers and facilities, and public agencies participate in the development of quality assurance and improvement standards that can be used to develop a uniform quality assurance program for use by all public and private health plans, providers, and facilities. To that end, in conducting the study required under RCW 43.70.066, the department of health shall:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Consider the needs of consumers, employers, health care providers and facilities, and public and private health plans;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take full advantage of existing national standards of quality assurance to extend to middle-income populations the protections required for state management of health programs for low-income populations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the appropriate minimum level of quality assurance standards that should be disclosed to consumers and employers by health care providers and facilities, and public and private health plans; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider standards that permit health care providers and facilities to share responsibility for participation in a uniform quality assurance program.</p>

<p>Public and private purchasers of health care services;</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>

<li>
<p>Consumers of health services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In conducting the study, the department shall propose standards that meet the needs of affected persons and organizations, whether public or private, without creation of differing levels of quality assurance. All consumers of health services should be afforded the same level of quality assurance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At a minimum, the study shall include but not be limited to the following program components and indicators appropriate for consumer disclosure:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Health care provider training, credentialing, and licensure standards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health care facility credentialing and recredentialing;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Annual mortality and morbidity rates of cases based on a defined set of procedures performed or diagnoses treated in health care facilities, adjusted to fairly consider variable factors such as patient demographics and case severity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The average total cost and average length of hospital stay for a defined set of procedures and diagnoses;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The total number of the defined set of procedures, by specialty, performed by each physician at a health care facility within the previous twelve months;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utilization performance profiles by provider, both primary care and specialty care, that have been adjusted to fairly consider variable factors such as patient demographics and severity of case;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health plan fiscal performance standards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health care provider and facility recordkeeping and reporting standards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health care utilization management that monitors trends in health service underutilization, as well as overutilization of services;</p>

<p>Health monitoring that is responsive to consumer, purchaser, and public health assessment needs; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assessment of consumer satisfaction and disclosure of consumer survey results.</p>

</ol>

<li>
<p>In conducting the study, the department shall develop standards that permit each health care facility, provider group, or health carrier to assume responsibility for and determine the physical method of collection, storage, and assimilation of quality indicators for consumer disclosure. The study may define the forms, frequency, and posting requirements for disclosure of information.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In developing proposed standards under this subsection, the department shall identify options that would minimize provider burden and administrative cost resulting from duplicative private sector data submission requirements.</p>

<p>In any action brought by the secretary of health or by a local health officer pursuant to chapter 7.60 RCW to place a public water system in receivership, the petition shall include the names of one or more suitable candidates for receiver who have consented to assume operation of the water system. The department shall maintain a list of interested and qualified individuals, municipal entities, special purpose districts, and investor-owned water companies with experience in the provision of water service and a history of satisfactory operation of a water system. If there is no other person willing and able to be named as receiver, the court shall appoint the county in which the water system is located as receiver. The county may designate a county agency to operate the system, or it may contract with another individual or public water system to provide management for the system. If the county is appointed as receiver, the secretary of health and the county health officer shall provide regulatory oversight for the agency or other person responsible for managing the water system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In any petition for receivership under subsection (1) of this section, the department shall recommend that the court grant to the receiver full authority to act in the best interests of the customers served by the public water system. The receiver shall assess the capability, in conjunction with the department and local government, for the system to operate in compliance with health and safety standards, and shall report to the court and the petitioning agency its recommendations for the system's future operation, including the formation of a water-sewer district or other public entity, or ownership by another existing water system capable of providing service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a petition for receivership and verifying affidavit executed by an appropriate departmental official allege an immediate and serious danger to residents constituting an emergency, the court shall set the matter for hearing within three days and may appoint a temporary receiver ex parte upon the strength of such petition and affidavit pending a full evidentiary hearing, which shall be held within fourteen days after receipt of the petition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bond, if any is imposed upon a receiver, shall be minimal and shall reasonably relate to the level of operating revenue generated by the system. Any receiver appointed pursuant to this section shall not be held personally liable for any good faith, reasonable effort to assume possession of, and to operate, the system in compliance with the court's orders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court shall authorize the receiver to impose reasonable assessments on a water system's customers to recover expenditures for improvements necessary for the public health and safety.</p>

<p>No later than twelve months after appointment of a receiver, the petitioning agency, in conjunction with the county in which the system is located, and the appropriate state and local health agencies, shall develop and present to the court a plan for the disposition of the system. The report shall include the recommendations of the receiver made pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. The report shall include all reasonable and feasible alternatives. After receiving the report, the court shall provide notice to interested parties and conduct such hearings as are necessary. The court shall then order the parties to implement one of the alternatives, or any combination thereof, for the disposition of the system. Such order shall include a date, or proposed date, for the termination of the receivership. Nothing in this section authorizes a court to require a city, town, public utility district, water-sewer district, or irrigation district to accept a system that has been in receivership unless the city, town, public utility district, water-sewer district, or irrigation district agrees to the terms and conditions outlined in the plan adopted by the court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court shall not terminate the receivership, and order the return of the system to the owners, unless the department of health approves of such an action. The court may impose reasonable conditions upon the return of the system to the owner, including the posting of a bond or other security, routine performance and financial audits, employment of qualified operators and other staff or contracted services, compliance with financial viability requirements, or other measures sufficient to ensure the ongoing proper operation of the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If, as part of the ultimate disposition of the system, an eminent domain action is commenced by a public entity to acquire the system, the court shall oversee any appraisal of the system conducted under Title 7 RCW to assure that the appraised value properly reflects any reduced value because of the necessity to make improvements to the system. The court shall have the authority to approve the appraisal, and to modify it based on any information provided at an evidentiary hearing. The court's determination of the proper value of the system, based on the appraisal, shall be final, and only appealable if not supported by substantial evidence. If the appraised value is appealed, the court may order that the system's ownership be transferred upon payment of the approved appraised value.</p>

If the department finds that programs are not available or not in use, it may, within funds appropriated for the purpose, provide grants to promote public education efforts. Grants may be awarded only after recipients have demonstrated coordination with relevant and knowledgeable groups within their communities, including at least schools, brain injury support organizations, hospitals, physicians, traffic safety specialists, police, and the public. The department may accept grants, gifts, and donations from public or private sources to use to carry out the head injury prevention program.</p>
<p>The department may assess or contract for the assessment of the effectiveness of public education efforts coordinated or initiated by any agency of state government. Agencies are directed to cooperate with assessment efforts by providing access to data and program records as reasonably required. The department may seek and receive additional funds from the federal government or private sources for assessments. Assessments shall contain findings and recommendations that will improve the effectiveness of public education efforts. These findings shall be distributed among public and private groups concerned with traumatic brain injury prevention.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that a large segment of Washington residents do not have access to critical health care services. Telemedicine is a way to increase access to health care services to those who would otherwise not have reasonable access. The legislature therefore intends to ensure that health care professionals who provide services through telemedicine, as defined in RCW 70.41.020, in cities and rural areas alike, have current information available, making it possible for them to provide telemedicine services to the entire state of Washington.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as permitted under subsection (3) of this section, beginning January 1, 2021, a health care professional who provides clinical services through telemedicine, other than a physician licensed under chapter 18.71 RCW or an osteopathic physician licensed under chapter 18.57 RCW, shall complete a telemedicine training. By January 1, 2020, the telemedicine collaborative shall make a telemedicine training available on its website for use by health care professionals who use telemedicine technology. If a health care professional completes the training, the health care professional shall sign and retain an attestation. The training:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Must include information on current state and federal law, liability, informed consent, and other criteria established by the collaborative for the advancement of telemedicine, in collaboration with the department and the Washington state medical quality assurance commission [medical commission];</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must include a question and answer methodology to demonstrate accrual of knowledge; and</p>

<p>The legislature recognizes that the state patrol, the administrative office of the courts, the sheriffs' and police chiefs' association, the department of social and health services, the *department of community, trade, and economic development, the sentencing guidelines commission, the department of corrections, and the superintendent of public instruction each have comprehensive data and analysis capabilities that have contributed greatly to our current understanding of crime and violence, and their causes.</p>
<p>The legislature finds, however, that a single health-oriented agency must be designated to provide consistent guidelines to all these groups regarding the way in which their data systems collect this important data. It is not the intent of the legislature by RCW 43.70.545 to transfer data collection requirements from existing agencies or to require the addition of major new data systems. It is rather the intent to make only the minimum required changes in existing data systems to increase compatibility and comparability, reduce duplication, and to increase the usefulness of data collected by these agencies in developing more accurate descriptions of violence.</p>

<p>The rule-making authority may adopt rules to implement and administer this section, including rules to establish a process to determine if a continuing education course meets the health equity continuing education requirement established in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section the following definitions apply:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Rule-making authority&quot; means the regulatory entities identified in RCW 18.130.040 and authorized to establish continuing education requirements for the health care professions governed by those regulatory entities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Structural competency&quot; means a shift in medical education away from pedagogic approaches to stigma and inequalities that emphasize cross-cultural understandings of individual patients, toward attention to forces that influence health outcomes at levels above individual interactions. Structural competency reviews existing structural approaches to stigma and health inequities developed outside of medicine and proposes changes to United States medical education that will infuse clinical training with a structural focus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Cultural safety&quot; means an examination by health care professionals of themselves and the potential impact of their own culture on clinical interactions and health care service delivery. This requires individual health care professionals and health care organizations to acknowledge and address their own biases, attitudes, assumptions, stereotypes, prejudices, structures, and characteristics that may affect the quality of care provided. In doing so, cultural safety encompasses a critical consciousness where health care professionals and health care organizations engage in ongoing self-reflection and self-awareness and hold themselves accountable for providing culturally safe care, as defined by the patient and their communities, and as measured through progress towards achieving health equity. Cultural safety requires health care professionals and their associated health care organizations to influence health care to reduce bias and achieve equity within the workforce and working environment.</p>

<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;multicultural health&quot; means the provision of health care services with the knowledge and awareness of the causes and effects of the determinants of health that lead to disparities in health status between different genders and racial and ethnic populations and the practice skills necessary to respond appropriately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department, in consultation with the disciplining authorities as defined in RCW 18.130.040, shall establish, within available department general funds, an ongoing multicultural health awareness and education program as an integral part of its health professions regulation. The purpose of the education program is to raise awareness and educate health care professionals regarding the knowledge, attitudes, and practice skills necessary to care for diverse populations to achieve a greater understanding of the relationship between culture and health. Any such education shall be developed in collaboration with education programs that train students in that health profession. No funds from the health professions account may be utilized to fund activities under this section unless the disciplining authority authorizes expenditures from its proportions of the account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By July 1, 2008, each education program with a curriculum to train health professionals for employment in a profession credentialed by a disciplining authority under chapter 18.130 RCW shall integrate into the curriculum instruction in multicultural health as part of its basic education preparation curriculum. The department may not deny the application of any applicant for a credential to practice a health profession on the basis that the education or training program that the applicant successfully completed did not include integrated multicultural health curriculum as part of its basic instruction.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The cost-reimbursement agreement shall identify the tasks and costs for work to be conducted under the agreement. The agreement must include a schedule that states:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The estimated number of weeks for initial review of the permit application;</p>

Under the provisions of a cost-reimbursement agreement, funds from the applicant or proponent shall be used by the department to contract with an independent consultant to carry out the work covered by the cost-reimbursement agreement. The department may also use funds provided under a cost-reimbursement agreement to hire temporary employees, to assign current staff to review the work of the consultant, to provide necessary technical assistance when an independent consultant with comparable technical skills is unavailable, and to recover reasonable and necessary direct and indirect costs that arise from processing the permit. The department shall, in developing the agreement, ensure that final decisions that involve policy matters are made by the agency and not by the consultant. The department shall make an estimate of the number of permanent staff hours to process the permits, and shall contract with consultants or hire temporary employees to replace the time and functions committed by these permanent staff to the project. The billing process shall provide for accurate time and cost accounting and may include a billing cycle that provides for progress payments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cost-reimbursement agreement must not negatively impact the processing of other permit applications. In order to maintain permit processing capacity, the agency may hire outside consultants, temporary employees, or make internal administrative changes. Consultants or temporary employees hired as part of a cost-reimbursement agreement or to maintain agency capacity are hired as agents of the state not of the permit applicant. The restrictions of chapter 42.52 RCW apply to any cost-reimbursement agreement, and to any person hired as a result of a cost-reimbursement agreement.</p>

<ol>
<li>The legislature finds that Washington state has the highest incidence of breast cancer in the nation. Despite this, mortality rates from breast cancer have declined due largely to early screening and detection. Invasive cervical cancer is the most preventable type of cancer. The Pap test, used to detect early signs of this disease, has been called &quot;medicine's most successful screening test.&quot; Applied consistently, invasive cervical cancer could nearly be eliminated. The legislature further finds that increasing access to breast and cervical cancer screening is critical to reducing incidence and mortality rates, and eliminating the disparities of this disease in women in Washington state. Furthermore, the legislature finds there is a need for a permanent program providing early detection and screening to the women and families of Washington state.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to establish an early detection breast and cervical cancer screening program as a voluntary screening program directed at reducing mortalities through early detection to be offered to eligible women only as funds are available.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>As used in this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Eligible woman&quot; means a woman who is age forty to sixty-four, and whose income is at or below two hundred fifty percent of the federal poverty level, as published annually by the federal department of health and human services. Priority enrollment shall be given to women as defined by the federal national breast and cervical cancer early detection program, under P.L. 101-354.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Approved providers&quot; means those state-supported health providers, radiology facilities, and cytological laboratories that are recognized by the department as meeting the minimum program policies and procedures adopted by the department to qualify under the federal national breast and cervical cancer early detection program, and are designated as eligible for funding by the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Comprehensive&quot; means a screening program that focuses on breast and cervical cancer screening as a preventive health measure, and includes diagnostic and case management services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of health is authorized to administer a state-supported early detection breast and cervical cancer screening program to assist eligible women with preventive health services. To the extent of available funding, eligible women may be enrolled in the early detection breast and cervical cancer screening program and additional eligible women may be enrolled to the extent that grants and contributions from community sources provide sufficient funds for expanding the program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Funds appropriated for the state program shall be used only to operate early detection breast and cervical cancer screening programs that have been approved by the department, or to increase access to existing state-approved programs, and shall not supplant federally supported breast and cervical cancer early detection programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enrollment in the early detection breast and cervical cancer screening program shall not result in expenditures that exceed the amount that has been appropriated for the program in the operating budget. If it appears that continued enrollment will result in expenditures exceeding the appropriated level for a particular fiscal year, the department may freeze new enrollment in the program. Nothing in this section prevents the department from continuing enrollment in the program if there are adequate private or public funds in addition to those appropriated in the biennial budget to support the cost of such enrollment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall establish a medical advisory committee composed of interested medical professionals and consumer liaisons with expertise in a variety of areas relevant to breast and cervical health to provide expert medical advice and guidance. The medical advisory committee shall address national, state, and local concerns regarding best practices in the field of early prevention and detection for breast and cervical cancer and assist the early detection breast and cervical cancer screening program in implementing program policy that follows the best practices of high quality health care for clinical, diagnostic, pathologic, radiological, and oncology services.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that a safe, efficient, and effective delivery of vaccinations is of the utmost importance for restoring societal and economic functions. As we learn more about the virus, the vaccine, and challenges to vaccine allocation and distribution, it is anticipated that the state's COVID-19 vaccination distribution plan will evolve. To that end, the legislature has provided flexibility by funding expenditures for testing, contact tracing, mitigation activities, vaccine administration and distribution, and other allowable uses for the state, local health jurisdictions, and tribes at the discretion of the secretary and without an appropriation. However, to maintain fiscal control and to ensure spending priorities align, the department is required to collaborate and communicate with the chairs and ranking members of the health care and fiscal committees of the legislature and local health jurisdictions in advance of any significant revision of the state's COVID-19 vaccination plan and to provide regular updates on its implementation and spending.</p>
