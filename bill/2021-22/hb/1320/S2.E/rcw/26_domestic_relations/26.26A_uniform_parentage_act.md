## 26.26A.305 - Scope—Limitation on use of genetic testing.
1. This subchapter, RCW 26.26A.300 through 26.26A.355, governs genetic testing of an individual in a proceeding to adjudicate parentage, whether the individual:

    a. Voluntarily submits to testing; or

    b. Is tested under an order of the court or a child support agency.

2. Genetic testing may not be used:

    a. To challenge the parentage of an individual who is a parent under RCW 26.26A.600 through 26.26A.635 and 26.26A.700 through 26.26A.785; or

    b. To establish the parentage of an individual who is a donor.

1. Except as otherwise provided in RCW 26.26A.300 through 26.26A.355 or 26.26A.400 through 26.26A.515, in a proceeding under this chapter to determine parentage, the court shall order the child and any other individual to submit to genetic testing if a request for testing is supported by the sworn statement of a party:

    a. Alleging a reasonable possibility that the individual is the child's genetic parent; or

    b. Denying genetic parentage of the child and stating facts establishing a reasonable possibility that the individual is not a genetic parent.

2. A child support agency may order genetic testing only if there is no presumed, acknowledged, or adjudicated parent of a child other than the woman who gave birth to the child.

3. The court or child support agency may not order in utero genetic testing.

4. If two or more individuals are subject to court-ordered genetic testing, the court may order that testing be completed concurrently or sequentially.

5. Genetic testing of a woman who gave birth to a child is not a condition precedent to testing of the child and an individual whose genetic parentage of the child is being determined. If the woman is unavailable or declines to submit to genetic testing, the court may order genetic testing of the child and each individual whose genetic parentage of the child is being adjudicated.

6. In a proceeding to adjudicate the parentage of a child having a presumed parent or an individual who claims to be a parent under RCW 26.26A.440, or to challenge an acknowledgment of parentage, the court may deny a motion for genetic testing of the child and any other individual after considering the factors in RCW 26.26A.460 (1) and (2).

7. If an individual requesting genetic testing is barred under RCW 26.26A.400 through 26.26A.515 from establishing the individual's parentage, the court shall deny the request for genetic testing.

8. An order under this section for genetic testing is enforceable by contempt.

## 26.26A.315 - Requirements for genetic testing.
1. Genetic testing must be of a type reasonably relied on by experts in the field of genetic testing and performed in a testing laboratory accredited by:

    a. The AABB, formerly known as the American association of blood banks, or a successor to its functions; or

    b. An accrediting body designated by the secretary of the United States department of health and human services.

2. A specimen used in genetic testing may consist of a sample or a combination of samples of blood, buccal cells, bone, hair, or other body tissue or fluid. The specimen used in the testing need not be of the same kind for each individual undergoing genetic testing.

3. Based on the ethnic or racial group of an individual undergoing genetic testing, a testing laboratory shall determine the databases from which to select frequencies for use in calculating a relationship index. If an individual or a child support agency objects to the laboratory's choice, the following rules apply:

    a. Not later than thirty days after receipt of the report of the test, the objecting individual or child support agency may request the court to require the laboratory to recalculate the relationship index using an ethnic or racial group different from that used by the laboratory.

    b. The individual or the child support agency objecting to the laboratory's choice under this subsection shall:

        i. If the requested frequencies are not available to the laboratory for the ethnic or racial group requested, provide the requested frequencies compiled in a manner recognized by accrediting bodies; or

        ii. Engage another laboratory to perform the calculations.

    c. The laboratory may use its own statistical estimate if there is a question which ethnic or racial group is appropriate. The laboratory shall calculate the frequencies using statistics, if available, for any other ethnic or racial group requested.

4. If, after recalculation of the relationship index under subsection (3) of this section using a different ethnic or racial group, genetic testing under RCW 26.26A.325 does not identify an individual as a genetic parent of a child, the court may require an individual who has been tested to submit to additional genetic testing to identify a genetic parent.

## 26.26A.320 - Report of genetic testing.
1. A report of genetic testing must be in a record and signed under penalty of perjury by a designee of the testing laboratory. A report complying with the requirements of RCW 26.26A.300 through 26.26A.355 is self-authenticating.

2. Documentation from a testing laboratory of the following information is sufficient to establish a reliable chain of custody and allow the results of genetic testing to be admissible without testimony:

    a. The name and photograph of each individual whose specimen has been taken;

    b. The name of the individual who collected each specimen;

    c. The place and date each specimen was collected;

    d. The name of the individual who received each specimen in the testing laboratory; and

    e. The date each specimen was received.

## 26.26A.325 - Genetic testing results—Challenge to results.
1. Subject to a challenge under subsection (2) of this section, an individual is identified under this chapter as a genetic parent of a child if genetic testing complies with RCW 26.26A.300 through 26.26A.355 and the results of the testing disclose:

    a. The individual has at least a ninety-nine percent probability of parentage, using a prior probability of 0.50, as calculated by using the combined relationship index obtained in the testing; and

    b. A combined relationship index of at least one hundred to one.

2. An individual identified under subsection (1) of this section as a genetic parent of the child may challenge the genetic testing results only by other genetic testing satisfying the requirements of RCW 26.26A.300 through 26.26A.355 which:

    a. Excludes the individual as a genetic parent of the child; or

    b. Identifies another individual as a possible genetic parent of the child other than:

        i. The woman who gave birth to the child; or

        ii. The individual identified under subsection (1) of this section.

3. Except as otherwise provided in RCW 26.26A.350, if more than one individual other than the woman who gave birth is identified by genetic testing as a possible genetic parent of the child, the court shall order each individual to submit to further genetic testing to identify a genetic parent.

1. Subject to subsection (2) of this section, if a genetic testing specimen is not available from an alleged genetic parent of a child, an individual seeking genetic testing demonstrates good cause, and the court finds that the circumstances are just, the court may order any of the following individuals to submit specimens for genetic testing:

    a. A parent of the alleged genetic parent;

    b. A sibling of the alleged genetic parent;

    c. Another child of the alleged genetic parent and the woman who gave birth to the other child; and

## 26.26A.350 - Genetic testing—Identical siblings.
1. If the court finds there is reason to believe that an alleged genetic parent has an identical sibling and evidence that the sibling may be a genetic parent of the child, the court may order genetic testing of the sibling.

2. If more than one sibling is identified under RCW 26.26A.325 as a genetic parent of the child, the court may rely on nongenetic evidence to adjudicate which sibling is a genetic parent of the child.

    d. Is in default after service of process and the court determines the alleged genetic parent to be a parent of the child; or

    e. Is neither identified nor excluded as a genetic parent by genetic testing and, based on other evidence, the court determines the alleged genetic parent to be a parent of the child.

    b. The child has more than one presumed parent.

3. Except as otherwise provided in RCW 26.26A.465, the following rules apply in a proceeding to adjudicate a presumed parent's parentage of a child if the woman who gave birth to the child is the only other individual with a claim to parentage of the child:

    c. If the presumed parent is not identified under RCW 26.26A.325 as a genetic parent of the child and the presumed parent or the woman who gave birth to the child challenges the presumed parent's parentage of the child, the court shall adjudicate the parentage of the child in the best interest of the child based on the factors under RCW 26.26A.460 (1) and (2).

4. Except as otherwise provided in RCW 26.26A.465 and subject to other limitations in RCW 26.26A.400 through 26.26A.515, if in a proceeding to adjudicate a presumed parent's parentage of a child, another individual in addition to the woman who gave birth to the child asserts a claim to parentage of the child, the court shall adjudicate parentage under RCW 26.26A.460.

If the court holds a hearing under this subsection, the hearing must be held on an expedited basis.

4. In a proceeding to adjudicate parentage of an individual who claims to be a de facto parent of the child, the court shall adjudicate the individual who claims to be a de facto parent to be a parent of the child if the individual demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that:

A finding of detriment to the child does not require a finding of unfitness of any parent or individual seeking an adjudication of parentage. In determining detriment to the child, the court shall consider all relevant factors, including the harm if the child is removed from a stable placement with an individual who has fulfilled the child's physical needs and psychological needs for care and affection and has assumed the role for a substantial period.

\[ [2018 c 6 § 513](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6037-S.SL.pdf?cite=2018%20c%206%20§%20513); \]

## 26.26A.465 - Precluding establishment of parentage by perpetrator of sexual assault.
1. For the purposes of this section, "sexual assault" means nonconsensual sexual penetration that results in pregnancy.

2. In a proceeding in which a parent alleges that a person committed a sexual assault that resulted in the parent becoming pregnant and subsequently giving birth to a child, the parent may seek to preclude the person from establishing or maintaining the person's parentage of the child. A parent who alleges that a child was born as a result of sexual assault may also seek additional relief as described in this section.

3. This section does not apply if the person described in subsection (2) of this section has previously been adjudicated in a proceeding brought under RCW 26.26A.400 to be a parent of the child, except as may be specifically permitted under subsection (4) of this section.

4. Unless RCW 26.26A.240 or 26.26A.430 applies, a parent must file a pleading making an allegation under subsection (2) of this section not later than four years after the birth of the child, except that for a period of one year after January 1, 2019, a court may waive the time bar in cases in which a presumed, acknowledged, or adjudicated parent was found in a criminal or separate civil proceeding to have committed a sexual assault against the parent alleging that the child was born as a result of the sexual assault.

5. If a parent makes an allegation under subsection (2) of this section and subsection (3) of this section does not apply, the court must conduct a fact-finding hearing on the allegation.

    a. The court may not enter any temporary orders providing residential time or decision making to the alleged perpetrator prior to the fact-finding hearing on the sexual assault allegation unless both of the following criteria are satisfied: (i) The alleged perpetrator has a bonded and dependent relationship with the child that is parental in nature; and (ii) the court specifically finds that it would be in the best interest of the child if such temporary orders are entered.

    b. Prior to the fact-finding hearing, the court may order genetic testing to determine whether the alleged perpetrator is biologically related to the child. If genetic testing reveals that the alleged perpetrator is not biologically related to the child, the fact-finding hearing must be stricken.

    c. Fourteen days prior to the fact-finding hearing, the parent alleging that the child was born as a result of a sexual assault shall submit affidavits setting forth facts supporting the allegation and shall give notice, together with a copy of the affidavit, to other parties to the proceedings, who may file opposing affidavits. Opposing affidavits must be submitted and served to other parties to the proceeding five days prior to the fact-finding hearing.

    d. The court shall determine on the record whether affidavits and documents submitted for the fact-finding hearing should be sealed.

6. An allegation under subsection (2) of this section may be proved by:

    a. Evidence that the person was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a sexual assault under RCW 9A.44.040, 9A.44.050, or 9A.44.060, or a comparable crime of sexual assault, including child rape of any degree, in this state or any other jurisdiction, against the child's parent and the child was born within three hundred twenty days after the sexual assault; or

    b. Clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that the person committed sexual assault, as defined in this section, against the child's parent and the child was born within three hundred twenty days after the sexual assault.

7. Subject to subsections (1) through (5) of this section, if the court determines that an allegation has been proved under subsection (6) of this section at the fact-finding hearing or after a bench trial, the court shall:

    a. Adjudicate that the person described in subsection (2) of this section is not a parent of the child, has no right to residential time or decision-making responsibilities for the child, has no right to inheritance from the child, and has no right to notification of, or standing to object to, the adoption of the child. If the parent who was the victim of the sexual assault expressly consents in writing for the court to decline to enter one or more of these restrictions or limitations, the court may do so;

    b. Require the state registrar of vital statistics to amend the birth record if requested by the parent and the court determines that the amendment is in the best interest of the child; and

    c. Require the person pay to child support, birth-related costs, or both, unless the parent requests otherwise and the court determines that granting the request is in the best interest of the child.

8. The child's parent or guardian may decline an order for child support or birth-related costs. If the child's parent or guardian declines an order for child support, and is either currently receiving public assistance or later applies for it for the child born as a result of the sexual assault, support enforcement agencies as defined in this chapter shall not file administrative or court proceedings to establish or collect child support, including medical support, from the person described in subsection (2) of this section.

9. If the court enters an order under subsection (8) of this section providing that no child support obligation may be established or collected from the person described in subsection (2) of this section, the court shall forward a copy of the order to the Washington state support registry.

10. The court may order an award of attorneys' fees under this section on the same basis as attorneys' fees are awarded under RCW 26.09.140.

11. Any party may move to close the fact-finding hearing and any related proceedings under this section to the public. If no party files such a motion, the court shall determine on its own initiative whether the fact-finding hearing and any related proceedings under this section should be closed to the public. Upon finding good cause for closing the proceeding, and if consistent with Article I, section 10 of the state Constitution, the court may:

    a. Restrict admission to only those persons whom the court finds to have a direct interest in the case or in the work of the court, including witnesses deemed necessary to the disposition of the case; and

    b. Restrict persons who are admitted from disclosing any information obtained at the hearing that would identify the parties involved or the child.
