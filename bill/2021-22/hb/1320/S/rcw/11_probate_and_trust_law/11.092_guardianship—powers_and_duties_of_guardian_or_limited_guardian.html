<li>
<p>DUTY OF GUARDIAN TO PAY. A guardian of the estate is under a duty to pay from the estate all just claims against the estate of the incapacitated person, whether they constitute liabilities of the incapacitated person which arose prior to the guardianship or liabilities properly incurred by the guardian for the benefit of the incapacitated person or his or her estate and whether arising in contract or in tort or otherwise, upon allowance of the claim by the court or upon approval of the court in a settlement of the guardian's accounts. The duty of the guardian to pay from the estate shall not preclude the guardian's personal liability for his or her own contracts and acts made and performed on behalf of the estate as it exists according to the common law. If it appears that the estate is likely to be exhausted before all existing claims are paid, preference shall be given to (a) the expenses of administration including guardian's fees, attorneys' fees, and court costs; (b) prior claims for the care, maintenance and education of the incapacitated person and of the person's dependents over other claims. Subject to court orders limiting such powers, a limited guardian of an estate shall have the same authority to pay claims.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CLAIMS MAY BE PRESENTED. Any person having a claim against the estate of an incapacitated person, or against the guardian of his or her estate as such, may file a written claim with the court for determination at any time before it is barred by the statute of limitations. After ten days' notice to a guardian or limited guardian, a hearing on the claim shall be held, at which upon proof thereof and after consideration of any defenses or objections by the guardian, the court may enter an order for its allowance and payment from the estate. Any action against the guardian of the estate as such shall be deemed a claim duly filed.</p>

<p>It shall be the duty of the guardian or limited guardian of an estate:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To file within three months after the guardian's appointment a verified inventory of all the property of the incapacitated person which comes into the guardian's possession or knowledge, including a statement of all encumbrances, liens, and other secured charges on any item;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To file annually, within ninety days after the anniversary date of the guardian's or limited guardian's appointment, and also within ninety days after termination of the appointment, unless the court for good cause orders a different deadline to file following termination, a written verified account of the administration for court approval, which account shall contain at least the following information:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Identification of property of the guardianship estate as of the date of the last account or, in the case of the initial account, as of the date of inventory;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identification of all additional property received into the guardianship, including income by source;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identification of all expenditures made during the account period by major categories;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any adjustments to the guardianship estate required to establish its present fair market value, including gains or losses on sale or other disposition and any mortgages, deeds of trust or other encumbrances against the guardianship estate; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identification of all property held in the guardianship estate as of the date of account, the assessed value of any real property and the guardian's estimate of the present fair market values of other property (including the basis on which such estimate is made), and the total net fair market value of the guardianship estate. In addition, immediately following such statement of present fair market value, the account shall set forth a statement of current amount of the guardian's bond and any other court-ordered protection for the security of the guardianship assets;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court in its discretion may allow reports at intervals of up to thirty-six months for estates with assets (exclusive of real property) having a value of not more than twice the homestead exemption. Notwithstanding contrary provisions of this section, the guardian or limited guardian of an estate need not file an annual report with the court if the funds of the guardianship are held for the benefit of a minor in a blocked account unless the guardian requests a withdrawal from such account, in which case the guardian shall provide a written verified account of the administration of the guardianship estate along with the guardian's petition for the withdrawal. The guardian or limited guardian shall report any substantial change in income or assets of the guardianship estate within thirty days of the occurrence of the change. A hearing shall be scheduled for court review and determination of provision for increased bond or other provision in accordance with RCW 11.88.100;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All court orders approving accounts or reports filed by a guardian or limited guardian must contain a guardianship summary placed directly below the case caption or on a separate cover page in the following form, or a substantially similar form, containing the following information:</p>

<p>To protect and preserve the guardianship estate, to apply it as provided in this chapter, to account for it faithfully, to perform all of the duties required by law, and at the termination of the guardianship or limited guardianship, to deliver the assets of the incapacitated person to the persons entitled thereto. Except as provided to the contrary herein, the court may authorize a guardian or limited guardian to do anything that a trustee can do under the provisions of RCW 11.98.070 for a period not exceeding one year from the date of the order or for a period corresponding to the interval in which the guardian's or limited guardian's report is required to be filed by the court pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, whichever period is longer;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To invest and reinvest the property of the incapacitated person in accordance with the rules applicable to investment of trust estates by trustees as provided in chapter 11.100 RCW, except that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>No investments shall be made without prior order of the court in any property other than unconditional interest bearing obligations of this state or of the United States and in obligations the interest and principal of which are unconditionally guaranteed by the United States, and in share accounts or deposits which are insured by an agency of the United States government. Such prior order of the court may authorize specific investments, or, in the discretion of the court, may authorize the guardian or limited guardian to invest and reinvest as provided in chapter 11.100 RCW without further order of the court;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is for the best interests of the incapacitated person that a specific property be used by the incapacitated person rather than sold and the proceeds invested, the court may so order;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To apply to the court no later than the filing of the inventory for an order authorizing disbursements on behalf of the incapacitated person. However, the guardian or limited guardian of the estate, or the person, department, bureau, agency, or charitable organization having the care and custody of an incapacitated person, may apply to the court for an order directing the guardian or limited guardian of the estate to pay to the person, department, bureau, agency, or charitable organization having the care and custody of an incapacitated person, or if the guardian or limited guardian of the estate has the care and custody of the incapacitated person, directing the guardian or limited guardian of the estate to apply an amount weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually, as the court may direct, to be expended in the care, maintenance, and education of the incapacitated person and of his or her dependents. In proper cases, the court may order payment of amounts directly to the incapacitated person for his or her maintenance or incidental expenses. The amounts authorized under this section may be decreased or increased from time to time by direction of the court. If payments are made to another under an order of the court, the guardian or limited guardian of the estate is not bound to see to the application thereof;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide evidence of the guardian or limited guardian's successful completion of any standardized training video or web cast for guardians or limited guardians made available by the administrative office of the courts and the superior court when the guardian or limited guardian: (a) Was appointed prior to July 22, 2011; (b) is not a certified professional guardian or financial institution authorized under RCW 11.88.020; and (c) has not previously completed the requirements of RCW 11.88.020(3). The training video or web cast must be provided at no cost to the guardian or limited guardian. The superior court may, upon (i) petition by the guardian or limited guardian; or (ii) any other method as provided by local court rule: (A) For good cause, waive this requirement for guardians appointed prior to July 22, 2011. Good cause shall require evidence that the guardian already possesses the requisite knowledge to serve as a guardian without completing the training. When determining whether there is good cause to waive the training requirement, the court shall consider, among other facts, the length of time the guardian has been serving the incapacitated person; whether the guardian has timely filed all required reports with the court; whether the guardian is monitored by other state or local agencies; and whether there have been any allegations of abuse, neglect, or a breach of fiduciary duty against the guardian; or (B) extend the time period for completion of the training requirement for ninety days; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide evidence of the guardian or limited guardian's successful completion of any additional or updated training video or web cast offered by the administrative office of the courts and the superior court as is required at the discretion of the superior court unless the guardian or limited guardian is a certified professional guardian or financial institution authorized under RCW 11.88.020. The training video or web cast must be provided at no cost to the guardian or limited guardian.</p>

<p>The court, upon the petition of a guardian of the estate of an incapacitated person other than the guardian of a minor, and after such notice as the court directs and other notice to all persons interested as required by chapter 11.96A RCW, may authorize the guardian to take any action, or to apply funds not required for the incapacitated person's own maintenance and support, in any fashion the court approves as being in keeping with the incapacitated person's wishes so far as they can be ascertained and as designed to minimize insofar as possible current or prospective state or federal income and estate taxes, permit entitlement under otherwise available federal or state medical or other assistance programs, and to provide for gifts to such charities, relatives, and friends as would be likely recipients of donations from the incapacitated person.</p>
<p>The action or application of funds may include but shall not be limited to the making of gifts, to the conveyance or release of the incapacitated person's contingent and expectant interests in property including marital or domestic partnership property rights and any right of survivorship incident to joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety, to the exercise or release of the incapacitated person's powers as donee of a power of appointment, the making of contracts, the creation of revocable or irrevocable trusts of property of the incapacitated person's estate which may extend beyond the incapacitated person's disability or life, the establishment of custodianships for the benefit of a minor under chapter 11.114 RCW, the Washington uniform transfers to minors act, the exercise of options of the incapacitated person to purchase securities or other property, the exercise of the incapacitated person's right to elect options and to change beneficiaries under insurance and annuity policies and the surrendering of policies for their cash value, the exercise of the incapacitated person's right to any elective share in the estate of the incapacitated person's deceased spouse or deceased domestic partner, and the renunciation or disclaimer of any interest acquired by testate or intestate succession or by inter vivos transfer.</p>
<p>The guardian in the petition shall briefly outline the action or application of funds for which approval is sought, the results expected to be accomplished thereby and the savings expected to accrue. The proposed action or application of funds may include gifts of the incapacitated person's personal or real property. Gifts may be for the benefit of prospective legatees, devisees, or heirs apparent of the incapacitated person, or may be made to individuals or charities in which the incapacitated person is believed to have an interest. Gifts may or may not, in the discretion of the court, be treated as advancements to donees who would otherwise inherit property from the incapacitated person under the incapacitated person's will or under the laws of descent and distribution. The guardian shall also indicate in the petition that any planned disposition is consistent with the intentions of the incapacitated person insofar as the intentions can be ascertained, and if the incapacitated person's intentions cannot be ascertained, the incapacitated person will be presumed to favor reduction in the incidence of the various forms of taxation and the partial distribution of the incapacitated person's estate as provided in this section. The guardian shall not, however, be required to include as a beneficiary any person whom there is reason to believe would be excluded by the incapacitated person. No guardian may be required to file a petition as provided in this section, and a failure or refusal to so petition the court does not constitute a breach of the guardian's fiduciary duties.</p>

If the court finds that the guardian or limited guardian has failed to discharge his or her duties as such in any respect, it may deny the guardian any compensation whatsoever or may reduce the compensation which would otherwise be allowed. Where the incapacitated person is a department of social and health services client residing in a nursing facility or in a residential or home setting and is required by the department of social and health services to contribute a portion of their income towards the cost of residential or supportive services then the department shall be entitled to notice of proceedings as described in RCW 11.92.150. The amount of guardianship fees and additional compensation for administrative costs shall not exceed the amount allowed by the department of social and health services by rule.</p>

<li>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in this section, an incapacitated person retains the right to associate with persons of the incapacitated person's choosing. This right includes, but is not limited to, the right to freely communicate and interact with other persons, whether through in-person visits, telephone calls, electronic communication, personal mail, or other means. If the incapacitated person is unable to express consent for communication, visitation, or interaction with another person, or is otherwise unable to make a decision regarding association with another person, a guardian of the incapacitated person, whether full or limited, must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Personally inform the incapacitated person of the decision under consideration, using plain language, in a manner calculated to maximize the understanding of the incapacitated person;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maximize the incapacitated person's participation in the decision-making process to the greatest extent possible, consistent with the incapacitated person's abilities; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give substantial weight to the incapacitated person's preferences, both expressed and historical.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A guardian or limited guardian may not restrict an incapacitated person's right to communicate, visit, interact, or otherwise associate with persons of the incapacitated person's choosing, unless:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The restriction is specifically authorized by the guardianship court in the court order establishing or modifying the guardianship or limited guardianship under chapter 11.88 RCW;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The restriction is pursuant to a protection order issued under chapter <strong>7.---</strong> RCW (the new chapter created in section 81 of this act), or other law, that limits contact between the incapacitated person and other persons; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The guardian or limited guardian has good cause to believe that there is an immediate need to restrict an incapacitated person's right to communicate, visit, interact, or otherwise associate with persons of the incapacitated person's choosing in order to protect the incapacitated person from abuse, neglect, abandonment, or financial exploitation, as those terms are defined in RCW 74.34.020, or to protect the incapacitated person from activities that unnecessarily impose significant distress on the incapacitated person; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within fourteen calendar days of imposing the restriction under (c)(i) of this subsection, the guardian or limited guardian files a petition for a <strong>vulnerable adult</strong> protection order under chapter <strong>7.---</strong> RCW (the new chapter created in section 81 of this act). The immediate need restriction may remain in place until the court has heard and issued an order or decision on the petition.</p>

<p>A <strong>vulnerable adult</strong> protection order under chapter <strong>7.---</strong> RCW (the new chapter created in section 81 of this act) issued to protect an incapacitated person as described in subsection (2)(c)(ii) of this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Must include written findings of fact and conclusions of law;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May not be more restrictive than necessary to protect the incapacitated person from abuse, neglect, abandonment, or financial exploitation as those terms are defined in <strong>section 2 of this act</strong>; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May not deny communication, visitation, interaction, or other association between the incapacitated person and another person unless the court finds that placing reasonable time, place, or manner restrictions is unlikely to sufficiently protect the incapacitated person from abuse, neglect, abandonment, or financial exploitation as those terms are defined in <strong>section 2 of this act</strong>.</p>
