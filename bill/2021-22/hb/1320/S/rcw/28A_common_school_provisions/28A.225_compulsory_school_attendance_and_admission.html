<li>
<p>Each school within a school district shall inform the students and the parents of the students enrolled in the school about: The benefits of regular school attendance; the potential effects of excessive absenteeism, whether excused or unexcused, on academic achievement, and graduation and dropout rates; the school's expectations of the parents and guardians to ensure regular school attendance by the child; the resources available to assist the child and the parents and guardians; the role and responsibilities of the school; and the consequences of truancy, including the compulsory education requirements under this chapter. The school shall provide access to the information before or at the time of enrollment of the child at a new school and at the beginning of each school year. If the school regularly and ordinarily communicates most other information to parents online, providing online access to the information required by this section satisfies the requirements of this section unless a parent or guardian specifically requests information to be provided in written form. Reasonable efforts must be made to enable parents to request and receive the information in a language in which they are fluent. A parent must date and acknowledge review of this information online or in writing before or at the time of enrollment of the child at a new school and at the beginning of each school year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall develop a template that schools may use to satisfy the requirements of subsection (1) of this section and shall post the information on its website.</p>

<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall develop and publish best practice guidance to eliminate or reduce student absences and to otherwise implement the requirements of this chapter.

<p>If a parent enrolls a child who is six or seven years of age in a public school, the child is required to attend and that parent has the responsibility to ensure the child attends for the full time that school is in session. An exception shall be made to this requirement for children whose parents formally remove them from enrollment if the child is less than eight years old and a petition has not been filed against the parent under subsection (3) of this section. The requirement to attend school under this subsection does not apply to a child enrolled in a public school part-time for the purpose of receiving ancillary services. A child required to attend school under this subsection may be temporarily excused upon the request of his or her parent for purposes agreed upon by the school district and parent.</p>

<p>With respect to any child, without an existing individualized education plan or 504 plan, reasonably believed to have a mental or physical disability or impairment, these steps must include informing the child's parent of the right to obtain an appropriate evaluation at no cost to the parent to determine whether the child has a disability or impairment and needs accommodations, related services, or special education services. This includes children with suspected emotional or behavioral disabilities as defined in WAC 392-172A-01035. If the school obtains consent to conduct an evaluation, time should be allowed for the evaluation to be completed, and if the child is found to be eligible for special education services, accommodations, or related services, a plan developed to address the child's needs.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this chapter, &quot;community engagement board&quot; means a board established pursuant to a memorandum of understanding between a juvenile court and a school district and composed of members of the local community in which the child attends school. Community engagement boards must include members who receive training regarding the identification of barriers to school attendance, the use of the Washington assessment of the risks and needs of students (WARNS) or other assessment tools to identify the specific needs of individual children, cultural responsive interactions, trauma-informed approaches to discipline, evidence-based treatments that have been found effective in supporting at-risk youth and their families, and the specific services and treatment available in the particular school, court, community, and elsewhere. Duties of a community engagement board shall include, but not be limited to: Identifying barriers to school attendance, recommending methods for improving attendance such as connecting students and their families with community services, culturally appropriate promising practices, and evidence-based services such as functional family therapy, suggesting to the school district that the child enroll in another school, an alternative education program, an education center, a skill center, a dropout prevention program, or another public or private educational program, or recommending to the juvenile court that a juvenile be offered the opportunity for placement in a HOPE center or crisis residential center, if appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that utilization of community engagement boards is the preferred means of intervention when preliminary methods to eliminate or reduce unexcused absences as required by RCW 28A.225.020 have not been effective in securing the child's attendance at school. The legislature intends to encourage and support the development and expansion of community engagement boards. Operation of a school truancy board does not excuse a district from the obligation of filing a petition within the requirements of RCW 28A.225.015(3).</p>

<li>
<p>By the beginning of the 2017-18 school year, juvenile courts must establish, through a memorandum of understanding with each school district within their respective counties, a coordinated and collaborative approach to address truancy through the establishment of a community engagement board or, with respect to certain small districts, through other means as provided in subsection (3) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, each school district must enter into a memorandum of understanding with the juvenile court in the county in which it is located with respect to the operation of a community engagement board. A community engagement board may be operated by a juvenile court, a school district, or a collaboration between both entities, so long as the agreement is memorialized in a memorandum of understanding. For a school district that is located in more than one county, the memorandum of understanding shall be with the juvenile court in the county that acts as the school district's treasurer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A school district with fewer than three hundred students must enter into a memorandum of understanding with the juvenile court in the county in which it is located with respect to: (a) The operation of a community engagement board; or (b) addressing truancy through other coordinated means of intervention aimed at identifying barriers to school attendance, and connecting students and their families with community services, culturally appropriate promising practices, and evidence-based services such as functional family therapy. School districts with fewer than three hundred students may work cooperatively with other school districts or the school district's educational service district to ensure access to a community engagement board or to provide other coordinated means of intervention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All school districts must designate, and identify to the local juvenile court and to the office of the superintendent of public instruction, a person or persons to coordinate school district efforts to address excessive absenteeism and truancy, including tasks associated with: Outreach and conferences pursuant to RCW 28A.225.018; entering into a memorandum of understanding with the juvenile court; establishing protocols and procedures with the court; coordinating trainings; sharing evidence-based and culturally appropriate promising practices; identifying a person within every school to serve as a contact with respect to excessive absenteeism and truancy; and assisting in the recruitment of community engagement board members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As has been demonstrated by school districts and county juvenile courts around the state that have worked together and led the way with community engagement boards, success has resulted from involving the entire community and leveraging existing dollars from a variety of sources, including public and private, local and state, and court, school, and community. In emulating this coordinated and collaborative approach statewide pursuant to local memoranda of understanding, courts and school districts are encouraged to create strong community-wide partnerships and to leverage existing dollars and resources.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Community restitution;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nonresidential programs with intensive wraparound services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A requirement that the child meet with a mentor for a specified number of times; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other services and interventions that the court deems appropriate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any parent violating any of the provisions of either RCW 28A.225.010, 28A.225.015, or 28A.225.080 shall be fined not more than twenty-five dollars for each day of unexcused absence from school. The court shall remit fifty percent of the fine collected under this section to the child's school district. It shall be a defense for a parent charged with violating RCW 28A.225.010 to show that he or she exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to cause a child in his or her custody to attend school or that the child's school did not perform its duties as required in RCW 28A.225.020. The court may order the parent to provide community restitution instead of imposing a fine. Any fine imposed pursuant to this section may be suspended upon the condition that a parent charged with violating RCW 28A.225.010 shall participate with the school and the child in a supervised plan for the child's attendance at school or upon condition that the parent attend a conference or conferences scheduled by a school for the purpose of analyzing the causes of a child's absence.</p>

<li>
<p>If a child continues to be truant after entering into a court-approved order with the community engagement board under RCW 28A.225.035, the juvenile court shall find the child in contempt, and the court may impose alternatives to detention consistent with best practice models for reengagement with school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the court's inherent contempt power or curtail its exercise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsections (1), (2), and (4) of this section shall not apply to a six or seven year old child required to attend public school under RCW 28A.225.015.</p>

<p>The protocols required by RCW 74.13.560 for making best interest determinations for students in out-of-home care must comply with the provisions of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Best interest determinations should be made as quickly as possible in order to prevent educational discontinuity for the student.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When making best interest determinations, every effort should be made to gather meaningful input from relevant and appropriate persons on their perspectives regarding which school the student should attend during his or her time in out-of-home care, consistent with the student's case plan. Relevant and appropriate persons include:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Representatives of the department of children, youth, and families;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Representatives of the school of origin, such as a teacher, counselor, coach, or other meaningful person in the student's life;</p>

<p>Biological parents;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foster parents;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Educational liaisons identified under RCW 13.34.045;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The student's relatives; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depending on his or her age, the student.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In accordance with RCW 74.13.550, whenever practical and in their best interest, students placed into out-of-home care must remain enrolled in the school that they were attending at the time they entered out-of-home care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Student-centered factors must be used to determine what is in a student's best interest. In order to make a well-informed best interest determination, a variety of student-centered factors should be considered, including:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>How long is the student's current out-of-home care placement expected to last?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the student's permanency plan and how does it relate to school stability?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many schools has the student attended in the current year?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many schools has the student attended over the past few years?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Considering the impacts of past transfers, how may transferring to a new school impact the student academically, emotionally, physically, and socially?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the immediate and long-term educational plans of, and for, the student?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How strong is the student academically?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the student has special needs, what impact will transferring to a new school have on the student's progress and services?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To what extent are the programs and activities at the potential new school comparable to, or more appropriate than, those at the school of origin?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does one school have programs and activities that address the unique needs or interests of the student that the other school does not have?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which school does the student prefer?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How deep are the child's ties to his or her school of origin?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Would the timing of the school transfer coincide with a logical juncture, such as after testing, after an event that is significant to the student, or at the end of the school year?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would changing schools affect the student's ability to earn full academic credit, participate in sports or other extracurricular activities, proceed to the next grade, or graduate on time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would the commute to the school under consideration impact the student, in terms of distance, mode of transportation, and travel time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How anxious is the student about having been removed from the home or about any upcoming moves?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What school does the student's sibling attend?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there safety issues to consider?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The student must remain in his or her school of origin while a best interest determination is made and while disputes are resolved in order to minimize disruption and reduce the number of school transfers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School districts are encouraged to use any:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Best interest determination guide developed by the office of the superintendent of public instruction during the discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of keeping the student in the school of origin or transferring the student to a new school; and</p>

<p>Dispute resolution process developed by the office of the superintendent of public instruction when there is a disagreement about school placement, the provision of educational services, or a dispute between agencies.</p>

<li>
<p>The special education services of a student must not be interrupted by a transfer to a new school.</p>
