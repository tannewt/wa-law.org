<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that hydrofluorocarbons are air pollutants that pose significant threats to our environment. Although hydrofluorocarbons currently represent a small proportion of the state's greenhouse gas emissions, emissions of hydrofluorocarbons have been rapidly increasing in the United States and worldwide, and they are hundreds to thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide. In 2019, the legislature took a significant step towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions from hydrofluorocarbons by transitioning to the use of less damaging hydrofluorocarbons or suitable substitutes in certain new foam, aerosol, and refrigerant uses. However, significant sources of hydrofluorocarbon emissions in Washington remain unaddressed by the 2019 legislation, including legacy uses of hydrofluorocarbons as a refrigerant in infrastructure that was installed prior to the effective dates of the restrictions in the 2019 law, and from sources like stationary air conditioners and heat pumps that were not covered by the 2019 law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to reduce hydrofluorocarbon emissions, including by:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Authorizing the establishment of a maximum global warming potential threshold for hydrofluorocarbons used as a refrigerant;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authorizing the regulation of hydrofluorocarbons in air conditioning and heat pumps;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applying the same basic emission control requirements to hydrofluorocarbons that have long applied to ozone-depleting substances used as refrigerants;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing a program to reduce leaks and encourage refrigerant recovery from large refrigeration and air conditioning systems;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Directing the state building code council to adopt codes that are consistent with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with hydrofluorocarbons;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing a state procurement preference for recycled refrigerants; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowing consideration of the global warming potential of refrigerants used in equipment incentivized under utility conservation programs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, it is the intent of the legislature that the ice rink used by Seattle's newest hockey franchise, the Seattle Kraken, should be as cold as possible, but also should be refrigerated using climate-friendly refrigerants, so that on opening night of the 2021-2022 National Hockey League season, as many fans as possible can simultaneously yell the Pacific Northwest's favorite new phrase: 'Release the Kraken!'</p>

i. A qualifying utility that acquires an eligible renewable resource or renewable energy credit may count that acquisition at one and two-tenths times its base value:

    i. A qualifying utility shall be considered in compliance with an annual target in (a) of this subsection if events beyond the reasonable control of the utility that could not have been reasonably anticipated or ameliorated prevented it from meeting the renewable energy target. Such events include weather‑related damage, mechanical failure, strikes, lockouts, and actions of a governmental authority that adversely affect the generation, transmission, or distribution of an eligible renewable resource under contract to a qualifying utility.

    i. Beginning January 1, 2016, only a qualifying utility that owns or is directly interconnected to a qualified biomass energy facility may use qualified biomass energy to meet its compliance obligation under this subsection.

    ii. A qualifying utility may no longer use electricity and associated renewable energy credits from a qualified biomass energy facility if the associated industrial pulping or wood manufacturing facility ceases operation other than for purposes of maintenance or upgrade.

k. An industrial facility that hosts a qualified biomass energy facility may only transfer or sell renewable energy credits associated with qualified biomass energy generated at its facility to the qualifying utility with which it is directly interconnected with facilities owned by such a qualifying utility and that are capable of carrying electricity at transmission voltage. The qualifying utility may only use an amount of renewable energy credits associated with qualified biomass energy that are equivalent to the proportionate amount of its annual targets under (a)(ii) and (iii) of this subsection that was created by the load of the industrial facility. A qualifying utility that owns a qualified biomass energy facility may not transfer or sell renewable energy credits associated with qualified biomass energy to another person, entity, or qualifying utility.

l. Beginning January 1, 2020, a qualifying utility may use eligible renewable resources as identified under RCW 19.285.030(12) (g) and (h) to meet its compliance obligation under this subsection (2). A qualifying utility may not transfer or sell these eligible renewable resources to another utility for compliance purposes under this chapter.

m.

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An eligible building owner that demonstrates early compliance with the applicable energy use intensity target under the standard established under RCW 19.27A.210 may receive a base incentive payment of eighty-five cents per gross square foot of floor area, excluding parking, unconditioned, or semiconditioned spaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The incentives provided in subsection (6) of this section are subject to the limitations and requirements of this section, including any rules or procedures implementing this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must establish requirements for the verification of energy consumption by the building owner and each participating electric utility, gas company, and thermal energy company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must provide an administrative process for an eligible building owner to appeal a determination of an incentive eligibility or amount.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By September 30, 2025, and every two years thereafter, the department must report to the appropriate committees of the legislature on the results of the incentive program under this section and may provide recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the program. <strong>The 2025 report to the legislature must include recommendations for aligning the incentive program established under this section consistent with a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from substitutes, as defined in section 2 of this act.</strong></p>
