<p>The health of the people of our state is a most important public concern. The state has an interest in assuring the continued existence of accessible, affordable health care facilities that are responsive to the needs of the communities in which they exist. The state also has a responsibility to protect the public interest in nonprofit hospitals and to clarify the responsibilities of local public hospital district boards with respect to public hospital district assets by making certain that the charitable and public assets of those hospitals are managed prudently and safeguarded consistent with their mission under the laws governing nonprofit and municipal corporations.</p>

<p>The department shall only approve an application if the parties to the acquisition have taken the proper steps to safeguard the value of charitable assets and ensure that any proceeds from the acquisition are used for appropriate charitable health purposes. To this end, the department may not approve an application unless, at a minimum, it determines that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The acquisition is permitted under chapter 24.03 RCW, the Washington nonprofit corporation act, and other laws governing nonprofit entities, trusts, or charities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nonprofit corporation that owns the hospital being acquired has exercised due diligence in authorizing the acquisition, selecting the acquiring person, and negotiating the terms and conditions of the acquisition;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The procedures used by the nonprofit corporation's board of trustees and officers in making its decision fulfilled their fiduciary duties, that the board and officers were sufficiently informed about the proposed acquisition and possible alternatives, and that they used appropriate expert assistance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No conflict of interest exists related to the acquisition, including, but not limited to, conflicts of interest related to board members of, executives of, and experts retained by the nonprofit corporation, acquiring person, or other parties to the acquisition;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nonprofit corporation will receive fair market value for its assets. The attorney general or the department may employ, at the expense of the acquiring person, reasonably necessary expert assistance in making this determination. This expense must be in addition to the fees charged under RCW 70.45.030;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Charitable funds will not be placed at unreasonable risk, if the acquisition is financed in part by the nonprofit corporation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any management contract under the acquisition will be for fair market value;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proceeds from the acquisition will be controlled as charitable funds independently of the acquiring person or parties to the acquisition, and will be used for charitable health purposes consistent with the nonprofit corporation's original purpose, including providing health care to the disadvantaged, the uninsured, and the underinsured and providing benefits to promote improved health in the affected community;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any charitable entity established to hold the proceeds of the acquisition will be broadly based in and representative of the community where the hospital to be acquired is located, taking into consideration the structure and governance of such entity; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A right of first refusal to repurchase the assets by a successor nonprofit corporation or foundation has been retained if the hospital is subsequently sold to, acquired by, or merged with another entity.</p>

<pre><code>a. A label on the equipment or product. The label must meet requirements designated by the department by rule. To the extent feasible, the department must recognize existing labeling that provides sufficient disclosure of the use of substitutes in the product or equipment **or of the compliance status of the products or equipment**.

    i. The department must consider labels required by state building codes and other safety standards in its rule making; and

    ii. The department may not require labeling of aircraft and aircraft components subject to certification requirements of the federal aviation administration.

b. Submitting information about the use of substitutes to the department, upon request.

    i. By December 31, 2019, all manufacturers must notify the department of the status of each product class utilizing hydrofluorocarbons or other substitutes restricted under subsection (1) of this section that the manufacturer sells, offers for sale, leases, installs, or rents in Washington state. This status notification must identify the substitutes used by products or equipment in each product or equipment class in a manner determined by rule by the department.

    ii. Within one hundred twenty days after the date of a restriction put in place under this section, any manufacturer affected by the restriction must provide an updated status notification. This notification must indicate whether the manufacturer has ceased the use of hydrofluorocarbons or substitutes restricted under this section within each product class and, if not, what hydrofluorocarbons or other restricted substitutes remain in use.

    iii. After the effective date of a restriction put in place under this section, any manufacturer must provide an updated status notification when the manufacturer introduces a new or modified product or piece of equipment that uses hydrofluorocarbons or changes the type of hydrofluorocarbons utilized within a product class affected by a restriction. Such a notification must occur within one hundred twenty days of the introduction into commerce in Washington of the product or equipment triggering this notification requirement.

c. **Alternative disclosure requirements to (a) of this subsection, if the department determines that the inclusion of a label denoting substitutes used or compliance status is not feasible for a particular product or equipment.**

Prior to the adoption or update of a rule under this section, the department must identify the sources of information it relied upon, including peer-reviewed science.</p>
