<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that home and housing security is more important to Washingtonians than ever before. The COVID-19 pandemic prompted Washington governor Jay Inslee to institute a stay-at-home order in March 2020, obliging millions of nonessential employees to remain at home. Governor Inslee also declared a statewide emergency in September 2020, when west coast wildfires destroyed 181 homes in Washington state and made outdoor air unbreathable for many weeks, leading millions to seek refuge indoors and in their homes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that: Homeownership is the main mechanism for building wealth for individuals and families in the middle class; owning a home is a way to create wealth and pass it on generationally; and institutional class and racial biases limits access to home ownership for many Washingtonians.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that middle class families have disproportionate tax responsibility due, in part, to property tax liability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that our paramount duty to fund common schools and increase equity in education relies on tax revenue that is disproportionately reliant on taxes paid by middle class property and homeowners, and that the inequities in our tax code limits access and sustainability of homeownership for working families, black, indigenous, and people of color homeowners, and elders, who are those age 65 and older, due, in part, to this over reliance on property taxes pricing them out of their homes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that we are living through a new civil rights moment, a moment of reflection and remedy of racial disparity in policing, employment, schools, and housing, and recognizes the link to racial and class bias in economic systems of capitalism. In 2018, the national assessment of education and progress found that Washington state ranked last among all fifty states in closing the white-black achievement gap among eighth graders between 2003 and 2017. In Washington state, black Americans earn 76 cents on the dollar of their white counterparts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that working families, black, indigenous, and people of color communities, and elders in Washington state are subject to more displacement and gentrification than other homeowners, and that racial justice cannot be realized without economic justice and access to housing and land, and that the enforcement of property tax laws has a socioeconomic and racial disparity impact generationally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds a loss of homeownership for working families has been extraordinary, particularly homeownership rates in black, indigenous, and people of color communities, including in King county, which has the largest concentration of black families in the state. Black family homeownership in King county since 1970, when the rate of black homeownership was at 49 percent, versus 64.2 percent for white families, has fallen by 2015 to 28 percent versus 63 percent for white families, as reported in the Seattle Times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that working families, black, indigenous, and people of color families, and elders experience more home foreclosure and forfeiture than other homeowners in Washington state, and that many home foreclosures are due to owing back property taxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that many Washingtonians are vulnerable to foreclosure by mortgage holders and other secured creditors, despite the homestead exemption limited in bankruptcy statute, RCW 6.13.030, which is a tool to protect the head of household from having their homes confiscated and sold to satisfy debts from unsecured creditors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to prevent more loss of real property and the displacement of working families, black, indigenous, and people of color communities, and elders. By exempting a portion of tax of one's primary residence, we can lower the inequities of cost of homeownership and responsibility of taxation, with the goal of making sure individuals can reside, raise their families, age in place, and stay in the communities they call home, without fear of displacement due to crises and/or increase in land and home value assessment. This is a means of providing equity in the tax code and serves as an antidisplacement tool for community land trusts, cooperative owners, and homeowners across Washington.</p>

<p>Subject to the conditions in this section, a portion of the assessed value of a qualified residence is exempt from the state levy but not from property taxes levied by any local taxing district. Subject to the adjustments and limitations in subsection (2) of this section, the antidisplacement property exemption from the state levy is equal to:</p>

<pre><code>    ii. For taxes levied for collection in 2026 and each subsequent year, the maximum amount of antidisplacement property tax exemption may be increased from the prior year's maximum exemption amount. The amount of such increase for a year is equal to the percentage growth in the state levy between the state levy for collection in the preceding year as compared to the state levy for collection two years ago. The department is responsible for making a determination of any increase in the amount of the antidisplacement property tax exemption and may round the dollar amount of the exemption to the nearest $1,000.

b. For purposes of (a) of this subsection, &quot;maximum amount of antidisplacement property tax exemption&quot; and &quot;maximum exemption amount&quot; mean:

    i. $250,000 for taxes levied for collection in 2024 and 2025; and

<li>
<p>The department shall provide the means for claimants to annually claim the antidisplacement property tax exemption for their primary qualified residence online. The department must also make paper applications available to claimants upon request. Each county assessor must also make applications available at the assessor's office, on the assessor's official website, and by mail or email upon request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall determine whether claimants have applied for an exemption for only a single qualified residence for the applicable calendar year. As resources allow, the department must notify claimants who appear to have applied for more than one residence or when the department is unable to confirm that the claimant applied for an exemption for only a single qualified residence. Such notification may be provided electronically and include a request for additional information needed to confirm that the claimant has applied for only a single qualified residence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By August 1st each year, the department must provide each county assessor a list of all claimants, parcels, and other information necessary for the assessor to determine if a claimant meets the eligibility requirements for the antidisplacement property tax exemption. Such list must indicate the department's determination whether or not the claimant has applied for a single qualified residence or whether the department is unable to determine whether the claimant has applied for a single qualified residence.

If the claimant holds a life estate in the qualified residence for which the antidisplacement property tax exemption is claimed and the claimant is not shown on the tax rolls as the taxpayer for that qualified residence, the remainderman or other person shown on the tax rolls as the taxpayer must also sign the application. All signatures on an application must be made under penalty of perjury as provided in RCW 9A.72.085.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notice of the antidisplacement property tax exemption and where to obtain further information about the exemption must be included on or with property tax statements and revaluation notices for residential property.

<p>The qualified residence must be occupied by the claimant as the claimant's principal place of residence as of the date of the signed application under subsection (4) of this section. A claimant who sells, transfers, or is displaced from the claimant's qualified residence may transfer the claimant's exemption status to a replacement qualified residence, but no claimant may receive the antidisplacement property tax exemption on more than one qualified residence in any calendar year. However, the confinement of the claimant to a hospital, nursing home, assisted living facility, or adult family home will not disqualify the claim of exemption if:</p>

<p>The assessed value of a dwelling owned by a cooperative housing association, corporation, or partnership must be reduced, for purposes of state property taxes levied on the dwelling, by the amount of the antidisplacement property tax exemption to which a claimant residing in that dwelling is entitled. The cooperative must pass the full amount of its property tax savings under this section to its members in proportion to each member's antidisplacement property tax exemption.

<p>A mobile home park cooperative or manufactured housing cooperative is entitled to any unused portion of the antidisplacement property tax exemption of its members. A mobile home park cooperative or manufactured housing cooperative receiving the unused portion of the antidisplacement property tax exemption of its members must pass the full amount of its property tax savings to its members in proportion to each member's unused antidisplacement property tax exemption. The cooperative may meet its obligation under this subsection (5)(d)(ii) by reducing the amount owed by the members to the cooperative or, if no amount be owed, by making payment to the members.

A claimant whose antidisplacement property tax exemption was denied because the application was filed after the deadline in subsection (4) of this section may seek a refund of state property taxes paid as a result of the denial as provided in RCW 84.69.020.

<p>(C) Natural disaster, such as flood or earthquake, occurring within two weeks of the due date of the application; or</p>
<p>(D) Other circumstances as the department may provide by rule.</p>
<pre><code>b. A denial under (a) of this subsection (6) is subject to appeal under the provisions of RCW 84.48.010 and in accordance with the provisions of RCW 84.40.038.

c. If the assessor determines that the claimant had received the antidisplacement property tax exemption in error in prior years, the county treasurer must collect all state property taxes that would have been paid on the claimant's residence for the prior years had the antidisplacement property tax exemption not been claimed, not to exceed six years. Interest, but not penalties, applies to such taxes and is computed at the same rates and in the same way as interest is computed on delinquent taxes. Taxes and interest imposed under this subsection (6)(c): (i) Must be extended on the tax roll; (ii) are due within 30 days after the date of the treasurer's billing for such taxes and interest; and (iii) constitute a lien on the real property to which the tax and interest applies as provided in chapter 84.60 RCW.

<p>Pursuant to the provisions of Article VII, section . . . (House Joint Resolution No. 4204), the state levy must be reduced as necessary to prevent the value exempted under the antidisplacement property tax exemption in section 2 of this act from resulting in a higher tax rate than would have occurred in the absence of the antidisplacement property tax exemption. The reduction required under this subsection (1) for a tax year may be administered by each county assessor by applying the antidisplacement property tax exemption under section 2 of this act, after receiving the state levy amount for their county for that tax year, to all properties approved for the antidisplacement property tax exemption for that tax year.</p>

<li>
<p>Prior to July 15th, the county legislative authority must form a board for the equalization of the assessment of the property of the county. The members of the board must receive a per diem amount as set by the county legislative authority for each day of actual attendance of the meeting of the board of equalization to be paid out of the current expense fund of the county. However, when the county legislative authority constitutes the board they may only receive their compensation as members of the county legislative authority. The board of equalization must meet in open session for this purpose annually on the 15th day of July or within fourteen days of certification of the county assessment rolls, whichever is later, and, having each taken an oath fairly and impartially to perform their duties as members of such board, they must examine and compare the returns of the assessment of the property of the county and proceed to equalize the same, so that each tract or lot of real property and each article or class of personal property must be entered on the assessment list at its true and fair value, according to the measure of value used by the county assessor in such assessment year, which is presumed to be correct under RCW 84.40.0301, and subject to the following rules:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>They must raise the valuation of each tract or lot or item of real property which is returned below its true and fair value to such price or sum as to be the true and fair value thereof, after at least five days' notice must have been given in writing to the owner or agent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They must reduce the valuation of each tract or lot or item which is returned above its true and fair value to such price or sum as to be the true and fair value thereof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They must raise the valuation of each class of personal property which is returned below its true and fair value to such price or sum as to be the true and fair value thereof, and they must raise the aggregate value of the personal property of each individual whenever the aggregate value is less than the true valuation of the taxable personal property possessed by such individual, to such sum or amount as to be the true value thereof, after at least five days' notice must have been given in writing to the owner or agent thereof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They must reduce the valuation of each class of personal property enumerated on the detail and assessment list of the current year, which is returned above its true and fair value, to such price or sum as to be the true and fair value thereof; and they must reduce the aggregate valuation of the personal property of such individual who has been assessed at too large a sum to such sum or amount as was the true and fair value of the personal property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board may review all claims for either real or personal property tax exemption**, including the antidisplacement property tax exemption under section 2 of this act,** as determined by the county assessor, and must consider any taxpayer appeals from the decision of the assessor thereon to determine (i) if the taxpayer is entitled to an exemption, and (ii) if so, the amount thereof.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board must notify the taxpayer and assessor of the board's decision within forty-five days of any hearing on the taxpayer's appeal of the assessor's valuation of real or personal property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The clerk of the board must keep an accurate journal or record of the proceedings and orders of the board showing the facts and evidence upon which their action is based, and the record must be published the same as other proceedings of county legislative authority, and must make a true record of the changes of the descriptions and assessed values ordered by the county board of equalization. The assessor must correct the real and personal assessment rolls in accordance with the changes made by the county board of equalization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county board of equalization must meet on the 15th day of July or within fourteen days of certification of the county assessment rolls, whichever is later, and may continue in session and adjourn from time to time during a period not to exceed four weeks, but must remain in session not less than three days. However, the county board of equalization with the approval of the county legislative authority may convene at any time when petitions filed exceed twenty-five, or ten percent of the number of appeals filed in the preceding year, whichever is greater.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No taxes, except special taxes, may be extended upon the tax rolls until the property valuations are equalized by the department of revenue for the purpose of raising the state revenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>County legislative authorities as such have at no time any authority to change the valuation of the property of any person or to release or commute in whole or in part the taxes due on the property of any person.</p>

However, no refunds as a result of an incorrect payment authorized under subsection (8) of this section made by a third party payee shall be granted.
