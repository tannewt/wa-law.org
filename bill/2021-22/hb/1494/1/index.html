<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that home and housing security is more important to Washingtonians than ever before. The COVID-19 pandemic prompted Washington governor Jay Inslee to institute a stay-at-home order in March 2020, obliging millions of nonessential employees to remain at home. Governor Inslee also declared a statewide emergency in September 2020, when west coast wildfires destroyed 181 homes in Washington state and made outdoor air unbreathable for many weeks, leading millions to seek refuge indoors and in their homes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that: Homeownership is the main mechanism for building wealth for individuals and families in the middle class; owning a home is a way to create wealth and pass it on generationally; and institutional class and racial biases limits access to home ownership for many Washingtonians.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that middle class families have disproportionate tax responsibility due, in part, to property tax liability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that our paramount duty to fund common schools and increase equity in education relies on tax revenue that is disproportionately reliant on taxes paid by middle class property and homeowners, and that the inequities in our tax code limits access and sustainability of homeownership for working families, black, indigenous, and people of color homeowners, and elders, who are those age 65 and older, due, in part, to this over reliance on property taxes pricing them out of their homes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that we are living through a new civil rights moment, a moment of reflection and remedy of racial disparity in policing, employment, schools, and housing, and recognizes the link to racial and class bias in economic systems of capitalism. In 2018, the national assessment of education and progress found that Washington state ranked last among all fifty states in closing the white-black achievement gap among eighth graders between 2003 and 2017. In Washington state, black Americans earn 76 cents on the dollar of their white counterparts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that working families, black, indigenous, and people of color communities, and elders in Washington state are subject to more displacement and gentrification than other homeowners, and that racial justice cannot be realized without economic justice and access to housing and land, and that the enforcement of property tax laws has a socioeconomic and racial disparity impact generationally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds a loss of homeownership for working families has been extraordinary, particularly homeownership rates in black, indigenous, and people of color communities, including in King county, which has the largest concentration of black families in the state. Black family homeownership in King county since 1970, when the rate of black homeownership was at 49 percent, versus 64.2 percent for white families, has fallen by 2015 to 28 percent versus 63 percent for white families, as reported in the Seattle Times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that working families, black, indigenous, and people of color families, and elders experience more home foreclosure and forfeiture than other homeowners in Washington state, and that many home foreclosures are due to owing back property taxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that many Washingtonians are vulnerable to foreclosure by mortgage holders and other secured creditors, despite the homestead exemption limited in bankruptcy statute, RCW 6.13.030, which is a tool to protect the head of household from having their homes confiscated and sold to satisfy debts from unsecured creditors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to prevent more loss of real property and the displacement of working families, black, indigenous, and people of color communities, and elders. By exempting a portion of tax of one's primary residence, we can lower the inequities of cost of homeownership and responsibility of taxation, with the goal of making sure individuals can reside, raise their families, age in place, and stay in the communities they call home, without fear of displacement due to crises and/or increase in land and home value assessment. This is a means of providing equity in the tax code and serves as an antidisplacement tool for land trusts, cooperative owners, and homeowners across Washington.</p>

<li>
<p>Subject to the conditions in this section, a portion of the assessed value of a residence is exempt from the state levy but not from property taxes levied by any local taxing district. Subject to the adjustments and limitations in subsection (2) of this section, the antidisplacement property exemption from the state levy is equal to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>For taxes levied for collection in 2024 and thereafter:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Up to the first $250,000 of assessed valuation, or the amount calculated pursuant to section 3 of this act, of each residential tax parcel consisting of fewer than three residences; and</p>

<li>
<p>Up to the first $250,000 of assessed valuation, or the amount calculated pursuant to section 3 of this act, of each residence within a multiunit residential dwelling wherein each residence is owned and taxed separately or is owned by members of a cooperative housing association, corporation, or partnership; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For taxes levied for collection in each subsequent year, the maximum amount of antidisplacement property tax exemption may be increased from the prior year's exemption amount. The amount of such increase for a year is equal to the percentage growth in the state levy between the state levy for collection in the preceding year as compared to the state levy for collection two years ago. The department is responsible for making a determination of any increase in the amount of the antidisplacement property tax exemption and may round the dollar amount of the exemption to the nearest $1,000.</p>

The department shall verify that claimants have a single residence claimed for the applicable calendar year. The department shall provide the county assessor a list of claimants, parcels, associated exemptions, and other necessary information by August 1st each year.</p>

If the claimant holds a life estate in the residence for which the antidisplacement property tax exemption is claimed and the claimant is not shown on the tax rolls as the taxpayer for that residence, the remainderman or other person shown on the tax rolls as the taxpayer must also sign the declaration. All signatures on a declaration must be made under penalty of perjury as provided in RCW 9A.72.085.</p>

<p>If the assessor receives a notice of declaration from the department or declaration after the deadline in subsection (4) of this section, the assessor must deny the antidisplacement property tax exemption unless the assessor determines that the claimant qualifies for the antidisplacement property tax exemption and that good cause exists to excuse the late filing. A claimant whose antidisplacement property tax exemption was denied because the declaration was filed after the deadline in subsection (4) of this section may seek a refund of state property taxes paid as a result of the denial as provided in RCW 84.69.020. For purposes of this subsection (6)(a)(ii), good cause may be shown by one or more of the following circumstances:</p>

c. If the assessor determines that the claimant had received the antidisplacement property tax exemption in error in prior years, the county treasurer must collect all state property taxes that would have been paid on the claimant's residence for the prior years had the antidisplacement property tax exemption not been claimed, not to exceed six years. Interest, but not penalties, applies to such taxes and is computed at the same rates and in the same way as interest is computed on delinquent taxes. Taxes and interest imposed under this subsection (6)(c): (i) Must be extended on the tax roll; (ii) are due within 30 days after the date of the treasurer's billing for such taxes and interest; and (iii) constitute a lien on the real property to which the tax and interest applies as provided in chapter 84.60 RCW.

<p>No refunds under the provisions of this section shall be made because of any error in determining the valuation of property, except as authorized in subsections (9), (10), (11), and (12) of this section nor may any refunds be made if a bona fide purchaser has acquired rights that would preclude the assessment and collection of the refunded tax from the property that should properly have been charged with the tax. Any refunds made on delinquent taxes must include the proportionate amount of interest and penalties paid. However, no refunds as a result of an incorrect payment authorized under subsection (8) of this section made by a third party payee shall be granted. The county treasurer may deduct from moneys collected for the benefit of the state's levies, refunds of the state's levies including interest on the levies as provided by this section and chapter 84.68 RCW.</p>
<p>The county treasurer of each county must make all refunds determined to be authorized by this section, and by the first Monday in February of each year, report to the county legislative authority a list of all refunds made under this section during the previous year. The list is to include the name of the person receiving the refund, the amount of the refund, and the reason for the refund.</p>
