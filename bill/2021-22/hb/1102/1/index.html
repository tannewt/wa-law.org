<h2 id="section-1-2067">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-2067">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature further finds that the lack of adequate federal meat inspection facilities makes it difficult for rural and small-scale livestock producers to legally sell their meat.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to establish an intrastate meat inspection program in order to encourage economic investment in the state's livestock industry, promote economic development within our communities, and ensure the resiliency of the state's food supply by providing safe access to locally produced meat.</p>
