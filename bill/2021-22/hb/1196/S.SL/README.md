## Section 7
> This section modifies existing section [18.130.180](/rcw/18_businesses_and_professions/18.130_regulation_of_health_professions—uniform_disciplinary_act.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/18_businesses_and_professions/18.130_regulation_of_health_professions—uniform_disciplinary_act.md) for context.

The following conduct, acts, or conditions constitute unprofessional conduct for any license holder under the jurisdiction of this chapter:

1. The commission of any act involving moral turpitude, dishonesty, or corruption relating to the practice of the person's profession, whether the act constitutes a crime or not. If the act constitutes a crime, conviction in a criminal proceeding is not a condition precedent to disciplinary action. Upon such a conviction, however, the judgment and sentence is conclusive evidence at the ensuing disciplinary hearing of the guilt of the license holder of the crime described in the indictment or information, and of the person's violation of the statute on which it is based. For the purposes of this section, conviction includes all instances in which a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is the basis for the conviction and all proceedings in which the sentence has been deferred or suspended. Nothing in this section abrogates rights guaranteed under chapter 9.96A RCW;

2. Misrepresentation or concealment of a material fact in obtaining a license or in reinstatement thereof;

3. All advertising which is false, fraudulent, or misleading;

4. Incompetence, negligence, or malpractice which results in injury to a patient or which creates an unreasonable risk that a patient may be harmed. The use of a nontraditional treatment by itself shall not constitute unprofessional conduct, provided that it does not result in injury to a patient or create an unreasonable risk that a patient may be harmed;

5. Suspension, revocation, or restriction of the individual's license to practice any health care profession by competent authority in any state, federal, or foreign jurisdiction, a certified copy of the order, stipulation, or agreement being conclusive evidence of the revocation, suspension, or restriction;

6. Except when authorized by RCW 18.130.345, the possession, use, prescription for use, or distribution of controlled substances or legend drugs in any way other than for legitimate or therapeutic purposes, diversion of controlled substances or legend drugs, the violation of any drug law, or prescribing controlled substances for oneself;

7. Violation of any state or federal statute or administrative rule regulating the profession in question, including any statute or rule defining or establishing standards of patient care or professional conduct or practice;

8. Failure to cooperate with the disciplining authority by:

    a. Not furnishing any papers, documents, records, or other items;

    b. Not furnishing in writing a full and complete explanation covering the matter contained in the complaint filed with the disciplining authority;

    c. Not responding to subpoenas issued by the disciplining authority, whether or not the recipient of the subpoena is the accused in the proceeding; or

    d. Not providing reasonable and timely access for authorized representatives of the disciplining authority seeking to perform practice reviews at facilities utilized by the license holder;

9. Failure to comply with an order issued by the disciplining authority or a stipulation for informal disposition entered into with the disciplining authority;

11. Violations of rules established by any health agency;

12. Practice beyond the scope of practice as defined by law or rule;

13. Misrepresentation or fraud in any aspect of the conduct of the business or profession;

16. Promotion for personal gain of any unnecessary or inefficacious drug, device, treatment, procedure, or service;

17. Conviction of any gross misdemeanor or felony relating to the practice of the person's profession. For the purposes of this subsection, conviction includes all instances in which a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is the basis for conviction and all proceedings in which the sentence has been deferred or suspended. Nothing in this section abrogates rights guaranteed under chapter 9.96A RCW;

18. The procuring, or aiding or abetting in procuring, a criminal abortion;

19. The offering, undertaking, or agreeing to cure or treat disease by a secret method, procedure, treatment, or medicine, or the treating, operating, or prescribing for any health condition by a method, means, or procedure which the licensee refuses to divulge upon demand of the disciplining authority;

20. The willful betrayal of a practitioner-patient privilege as recognized by law;

21. Violation of chapter 19.68 RCW or a pattern of violations of RCW **41.05.700(8), 48.43.735(8),** 48.49.020 **,** 48.49.030**, 71.24.335(8), or 74.09.325(8)**;

22. Interference with an investigation or disciplinary proceeding by willful misrepresentation of facts before the disciplining authority or its authorized representative, or by the use of threats or harassment against any patient or witness to prevent them from providing evidence in a disciplinary proceeding or any other legal action, or by the use of financial inducements to any patient or witness to prevent or attempt to prevent him or her from providing evidence in a disciplinary proceeding;

## Section 9
> This section modifies existing section [28B.20.830](/rcw/28B_higher_education/28B.020_university_of_washington.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/28B_higher_education/28B.020_university_of_washington.md) for context.

1. The collaborative for the advancement of telemedicine is created to enhance the understanding and use of health services provided through telemedicine and other similar models in Washington state.

2. By July 1, 2016, the collaborative shall be convened. The collaborative shall develop recommendations on improving reimbursement and access to services, including originating site restrictions, provider to provider consultative models, and technologies and models of care not currently reimbursed; identify the existence of telemedicine best practices, guidelines, billing requirements, and fraud prevention developed by recognized medical and telemedicine organizations; and explore other priorities identified by members of the collaborative. After review of existing resources, the collaborative shall explore and make recommendations on whether to create a technical assistance center to support providers in implementing or expanding services delivered through telemedicine technologies.

3. The collaborative must submit an initial progress report by December 1, 2016, with follow-up policy reports including recommendations by December 1, 2017, December 1, 2018, and December 1, 2021.

By December 1, 2021, the collaborative must submit a report to the legislature on its recommendations regarding the need for an established relationship for audio-only telemedicine.**

7. The future of the collaborative shall be reviewed by the legislature with consideration of ongoing technical assistance needs and opportunities. The collaborative terminates December 31, **2023**.


## Section 10
If any part of this act is found to be in conflict with federal requirements that are a prescribed condition to the allocation of federal funds to the state, the conflicting part of this act is inoperative solely to the extent of the conflict and with respect to the agencies directly affected, and this finding does not affect the operation of the remainder of this act in its application to the agencies concerned. Rules adopted under this act must meet federal requirements that are a necessary condition to the receipt of federal funds by the state. Nothing in this act alters the requirement for the health care authority to report potential fraud to the medicaid fraud control division of the Washington attorney general's office under 42 C.F.R. 455.21.
