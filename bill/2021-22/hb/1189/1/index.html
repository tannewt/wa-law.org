<li>
<p>A local government may finance public improvements using tax increment financing subject to the following conditions:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The local government must adopt an ordinance designating an increment area within its boundaries and specifying the public improvements proposed to be financed in whole or in part with the use of tax increment financing;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The increment area or combined increment areas cannot include the area of the entire jurisdiction of the local government;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A local government can have no more than three active increment areas at any given time and they may not physically overlap by including the same land in more than one increment area at any time;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An increment area under this section must be retired no more than 25 years after the adoption of the ordinance designating the increment area; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The local government must make a finding that:</p>
<ol type="i">

<p>Private development that is anticipated to occur within the increment area as a result of the public improvements financed in whole or in part using tax increment financing will be processed consistent with the permitting jurisdiction's applicable zoning and development standards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proposed development would not reasonably be expected to occur solely through private investment within the reasonably foreseeable future; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The increased assessed value of the site that could reasonably be expected to occur without the use of tax increment financing would be less than the increase in the assessed value estimated to result from the proposed development.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>An assessment of the project job creation from the development;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An assessment of any impacts and any necessary mitigation to address the impacts identified on the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Affordable and low-income housing;</p>

<p>The local government shall:</p>

<li>
<p>Publish notice in a legal newspaper of general circulation within the increment area that describes the public improvement, describes the boundaries of the increment area, and identifies the location and times where the ordinance and other public information concerning the public improvement may be inspected; and</p>

<p>Each taxing district shall receive that portion of its regular property taxes produced by the rate of tax levied by or for the taxing district on the tax allocation base value for that tax increment financing project in the taxing district;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The local government that created the increment area shall receive an additional portion of the regular property taxes levied by or for each taxing district upon the increment value within the increment area. The local government that created the increment area may agree to receive less than the full amount of this portion as long as bond debt service, reserve, and other bond covenant requirements are satisfied, in which case the balance of these tax receipts shall be allocated to the taxing districts that imposed regular property taxes, or have regular property taxes imposed for them, in the increment area for collection that year in proportion to their regular tax levy rates for collection that year. The local government may request that the treasurer transfer this additional portion of the property taxes to its designated agent. The portion of the tax receipts distributed to the local government or its agent under this subsection (1)(b) may only be expended to finance public improvement costs associated with the public improvements financed in whole or in part by tax increment financing; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section shall not apply to any portion of the property tax levied by the state for the support of the common schools under RCW 84.52.065.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The apportionment of increases in assessed valuation in an increment area, and the associated distribution to the local government of receipts from regular property taxes that are imposed on the increment value, must cease when tax allocation revenues are no longer necessary or obligated to pay the costs of the public improvements. Any excess tax allocation revenues and earnings on the tax allocation revenues remaining at the time the apportionment of tax receipts terminates must be returned to the county treasurer and distributed to the taxing districts that imposed regular property taxes, or had regular property taxes imposed for it, in the increment area for collection that year, in proportion to the rates of their regular property tax levies for collection that year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The apportionment and distribution of portions of the regular property taxes levied by or for each taxing district upon the increment value within the increment area pursuant to and subject to the requirements of this chapter is declared to be a public purpose of and benefit each such taxing district.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The apportionment and distribution of portions of the regular property taxes levied by or for each taxing district upon the increment value within the increment area pursuant to this section shall not affect or be deemed to affect the rate of taxes levied by or within any such taxing district or the consistency of any such levies with the uniformity requirement of Article VII, section 1 of the state Constitution.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A local government designating a tax increment financing area may incur general indebtedness, and issue general obligation bonds, to finance the public improvements and retire the indebtedness in whole or in part from tax allocation revenues it receives, subject to the following requirements: The ordinance adopted by the local government creating the increment area and authorizing the use of tax increment financing indicates an intent to incur this indebtedness and the maximum amount of this indebtedness that is contemplated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The general indebtedness incurred under subsection (1) of this section may be payable from other tax revenues, the full faith and credit of the local government, and nontax income, revenues, fees, and rents from the public improvements, as well as contributions, grants, and nontax money available to the local government for payment of costs of the public improvements or associated debt service on the general indebtedness.</p>
</li>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A local government may issue revenue bonds to fund revenue-generating public improvements, or portions of public improvements, that are located within an increment area and that it is authorized to provide or operate. Whenever revenue bonds are to be issued, the legislative authority of the local government shall create or have created a special fund or funds from which, along with any reserves created pursuant to RCW 39.44.140, the principal and interest on these revenue bonds shall exclusively be payable. The legislative authority of the local government may obligate the local government to set aside and pay into the special fund or funds a fixed proportion or a fixed amount of the revenues from the public improvements that are funded by the revenue bonds. This amount or proportion is a lien and charge against these revenues, subject only to operating and maintenance expenses. The local government shall have due regard for the cost of operation and maintenance of the public improvements that are funded by the revenue bonds, and shall not set aside into the special fund or funds a greater amount or proportion of the revenues that in its judgment will be available over and above the cost of maintenance and operation and the amount or proportion, if any, of the revenue previously pledged. The local government may also provide that revenue bonds payable out of the same source or sources of revenue may later be issued on a parity with any revenue bonds being issued and sold.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revenue bonds issued under this section are not an indebtedness of the local government issuing the bonds, and the interest and principal on the bonds shall only be payable from the revenues lawfully pledged to meet the principal and interest requirements and any reserves created pursuant to RCW 39.44.140. The owner or bearer of a revenue bond or any interest coupon issued under this section shall not have any claim against the local government arising from the bond or coupon except for payment from the revenues lawfully pledged to meet the principal and interest requirements and any reserves created pursuant to RCW 39.44.140. The substance of the limitations included in this subsection shall be plainly printed, written, or engraved on each bond issued under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revenue bonds with a maturity in excess of 30 years shall not be issued under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislative authority of the local government shall by resolution determine for each revenue bond issue the amount, date, form, terms, conditions, denominations, maximum fixed or variable interest rate or rates, maturity or maturities, redemption rights, registration privileges, manner of execution, manner of sale, callable provisions, if any, and covenants including the refunding of existing revenue bonds. Facsimile signatures may be used on the bonds and any coupons. Refunding revenue bonds may be issued in the same manner as revenue bonds are issued.</p>
