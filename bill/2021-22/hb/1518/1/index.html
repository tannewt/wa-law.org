<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/43_state_government%E2%80%94executive/43.019A_recycled_product_procurement.html">43.19A.022</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/43_state_government%E2%80%94executive/43.019A_recycled_product_procurement.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>By July 1, 2023, all</strong> state agencies shall purchase one hundred percent recycled content white cut sheet bond paper <strong>or paper produced in a process that yields at least 40 percent less carbon dioxide than standard copy paper, which constitutes a substantial reduction in carbon dioxide,</strong> used in office printers and copiers. State agencies are encouraged to give priority to purchasing from companies that produce paper in facilities that generate energy from a renewable energy source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State agencies that utilize office printers and copiers that, after reasonable attempts, cannot be calibrated to utilize such paper referenced in subsection (1) of this section, must for those models of equipment:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Purchase paper at the highest recycled content <strong>or produced in a process that yields a high reduction in carbon dioxide</strong> that can be utilized efficiently by the copier or printer;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the time of lease renewal or at the end of the life cycle, either lease or purchase a model that will efficiently utilize one hundred percent recycled content white cut sheet bond paper <strong>or paper produced in a process that yields at least 40 percent less carbon dioxide than standard copy paper</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Printed projects that require the use of high volume production inserters or high-speed digital devices, such as those used by the department of enterprise services, are not required to meet the one hundred percent recycled content <strong>requirement or requirement of being made in a process that yields at least a 40 percent reduction in carbon dioxide than standard copy paper</strong>, but must utilize the highest recycled content <strong>or a high reduction in carbon dioxide</strong> that can be utilized efficiently by such equipment and not impede the business of agencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of enterprise services shall identify for use by agencies <strong>paper products that are</strong> one hundred percent recycled <strong>or produced in a process that yields at least 40 percent less carbon dioxide than standard copy paper and</strong> process efficiently through high-speed production equipment and do not impede the business of agencies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
