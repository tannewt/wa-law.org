<p>This act may be known and cited as the psychology interjurisdictional compact act.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-224">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-224">¶</a></h2>
<p>(1) The legislature finds:
(a) States license psychologists in order to protect the public through verification of education, training, and experience, and to ensure accountability for professional practice;
(b) The psychology interjurisdictional compact is intended to regulate the day-to-day practice of telepsychology and the provision of psychological services using telecommunication technologies by psychologists across state boundaries in the performance of their psychological practice as assigned by an appropriate authority;
(c) The psychology interjurisdictional compact is intended to regulate the temporary in-person, face-to-face practice of psychology by psychologists across state boundaries for 30 days within a calendar year in the performance of their psychological practice as assigned by an appropriate authority;
(d) The psychology interjurisdictional compact is intended to authorize state psychology regulatory authorities to afford legal recognition, in a manner consistent with the terms of the compact, to psychologists licensed in another state;
(e) The psychology interjurisdictional compact recognizes that states have a vested interest in protecting the public's health and safety through their licensing and regulation of psychologists and that state regulation best protects public health and safety;
(f) The psychology interjurisdictional compact does not apply when a psychologist is licensed in both the home and receiving states; and
(g) The psychology interjurisdictional compact does not apply to permanent in-person, face-to-face practice; it does allow for authorization of temporary psychological practice.
(2) Consistent with the findings of subsection (1) of this section, the psychology interjurisdictional compact is designed to achieve the following purposes and objectives:
(a) Increase public access to professional psychological services by allowing for telepsychological practice across state lines as well as temporary in-person, face-to-face services into a state in which the psychologist is not licensed to practice psychology;
(b) Enhance the states' ability to protect the public's health and safety, especially client/patient safety;
(c) Encourage the cooperation of compact states in the areas of psychology licensure and regulation;
(d) Facilitate the exchange of information between compact states regarding psychologist licensure, adverse actions, and disciplinary history;
(e) Promote compliance with the laws governing psychological practice in each compact state; and

The home state psychology regulatory authority must promptly report the conclusions of the investigations to the commission. Once an investigation has been completed, and pending the outcome of the investigation, the psychologist may change his or her home state licensure. The commission must promptly notify the new home state of any such decisions as provided in the rules of the commission. All information provided to the commission or distributed by compact states under the investigation of the psychologist is confidential, filed under seal, and used for investigatory or disciplinary matters. The commission may create additional rules for mandated or discretionary sharing of information by compact states.</p>

<p>(1)(a) The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each compact state must enforce the psychology interjurisdictional compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent.

(2)(a) If the commission determines that a compact state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under the psychology interjurisdictional compact or rules adopted under this compact, the commission must:

(ii) Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
(b) If a state in default fails to remedy the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compact states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact are terminated on the effective date of the termination. A remedy of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
(c) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or termination must be submitted by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the compact states.

(e) The commission shall not bear any costs incurred by the state which is found to be in default or which has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state.
(f) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the United States district court for the state of Georgia or the federal district where the compact has its principal offices.

(b) By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the United States district court for the state of Georgia or the federal district where the compact has its principal offices against a compact state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its adopted rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. If judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees.
(c) The remedies in this section are not the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.</p>

(2) Any state which joins the compact subsequent to the commission's initial adoption of the rules are subject to the rules as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes law in that state.

(3) Any compact state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the compact.
(a) A compact state's withdrawal does not take effect until six months after enactment of the repealing statute.
(b) Withdrawal does not affect the continuing requirements of the withdrawing state's psychology regulatory authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this chapter before the effective date of withdrawal.
(4) Nothing contained in the psychology interjurisdictional compact may be construed to invalidate or prevent any psychology licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a compact state and a noncompact state which does not conflict with the provisions of this compact.
(5) This compact may be amended by the compact states. No amendment to this compact becomes effective and binding upon any compact state until it is enacted into the law of all compact states.</p>

<p>The psychology interjurisdictional compact must be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes of the compact. If the compact is held to be contrary to the constitution of any state member to the compact, the compact remains in full force and effect as to the remaining compact states.</p>
<h2 id="section-16-39">Section 16 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-16-39">¶</a></h2>
