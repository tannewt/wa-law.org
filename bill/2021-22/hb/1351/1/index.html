<p>a. If disputed credit history is used to determine eligibility for coverage and a consumer is placed with an affiliate that charges higher premiums or offers less favorable policy terms:</p>
<pre><code> i. The insurer shall reissue or rerate the policy retroactive to the effective date of the current policy term; and

 ii. The policy, as reissued or rerated, shall provide premiums and policy terms the consumer would have been eligible for if accurate credit history had been used to determine eligibility.

<pre><code> i. **Require the consumer to provide reasonable written and independently verifiable documentation of the event;**

 ii. **Require the consumer to demonstrate that the event had direct and meaningful impact on the consumer's credit information;**

 iii. **Require such request be made no more than 60 days from the date of the application for insurance or the policy renewal;**

 iv. **Grant an exception despite the consumer not providing the initial request for an exception in writing; and**

Nothing in this section shall be construed to provide a consumer or other insured with a cause of action that does not exist in the absence of this section.</strong></p>
<p>d. <strong>The insurer shall provide notice to consumers that reasonable exceptions are available and information about how the consumer may inquire further.</strong></p>
<p>e. <strong>Within 30 days of the insurer's receipt of sufficient documentation of an event described in (a) of this subsection, the insurer shall inform the consumer of the outcome of the request for a reasonable exception.
