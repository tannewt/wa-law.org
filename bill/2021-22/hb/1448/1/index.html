<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that volunteer firefighters provide a valuable service for communities. In some areas of the state, particularly in more rural areas, a fire protection district may rely solely on volunteer firefighters to provide this critical service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that volunteer firefighters may receive some reimbursement for their contributions. These payments are not equivalent to compensation for their volunteer duties, and volunteers do not expect acceptance of such reimbursement to impact their eligibility or potential benefits under the unemployment insurance system if they were to lose their primary employment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature therefore intends to exclude such payments received for service as a volunteer firefighter from unemployment insurance eligibility and benefit determinations.</p>
