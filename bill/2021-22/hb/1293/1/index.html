<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the court may reduce any term of incarceration or other criminal penalties under this chapter or impose available alternatives as provided under subsection (3) of this section when sentencing any defendant for one or more crimes where: The defendant is a survivor of domestic violence committed by an intimate partner; the domestic violence suffered by the defendant was a significant contributing factor to the defendant's criminal conduct; and the generally applicable sentencing requirements under this chapter would be unduly harsh given the nature and circumstances of the crime and the history, character, and condition of the defendant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Prior to reducing a term of incarceration or imposing alternatives under this section, the court shall make findings as to whether the defendant qualifies under this section. The court may determine a defendant qualifies under this section regardless if the defendant previously raised any defense related to the domestic violence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court may consider the following when making its finding as to whether the domestic violence suffered by the defendant was a significant contributing factor to his or her criminal conduct: Whether the defendant is being sentenced for a crime against an intimate partner who committed domestic violence against the defendant; whether, at any point in time, the defendant has been diagnosed with or treated for any behavioral health condition related to prior victimization; evidence that the defendant's prior victimization has affected how the defendant perceives their safety and security; evidence that the defendant's prior victimization has affected how the defendant perceives their ability to receive help through law enforcement or other government entities; evidence that the defendant's prior victimization has limited the defendant's ability to achieve financial independence; and any other factors deemed relevant by the court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In making findings under this section, the court may consider any of the following: Oral and written arguments; a written statement from the defendant; testimony from the defendant or from witnesses offered by either party; written statements from third parties regarding whether the defendant is a survivor of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking including, but not limited to, statements from a mental health or victim service provider or school administrator or teacher; medical records and documents; physical evidence; copies of restraining, antiharassment, or protection orders; police reports; recordings of 911 calls; expert testimony; and any other relevant evidence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court finds that a defendant qualifies under this section, the court may, in its discretion:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Impose a sentence below the standard range under RCW 9.94A.510, and below any mandatory minimum terms under RCW 9.94A.540 and 9.94A.570;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depart downward from any sentencing enhancements under RCW 9.94A.533; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impose the sentencing alternative under section 3 of this act.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section modifies the authority of the court to impose any other available sentencing alternatives for a qualifying defendant including, but not limited to, alternatives under RCW 9.94A.650, 9.94A.655, 9.94A.660, 9.94A.670, or 9.94A.711.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>If the sentencing court determines that the person is eligible for the sentencing alternative under this section and that the sentencing alternative is appropriate and should be imposed, the court shall waive the sentence within the standard sentence range and any applicable enhancements, and instead impose: A reduced term of confinement with an extended term of community custody, as determined by the court; or waive the term of confinement and impose an extended term of community custody. The court has complete discretion to determine the term of incarceration and community custody, provided that the combined length of both does not exceed the standard range and enhancements applicable to the underlying crime or crimes for which the defendant has been convicted. For the term of community custody, the court may impose conditions as provided in RCW 9.94A.703 and may impose other affirmative conditions as the court considers appropriate, and the department may impose conditions and sanctions as authorized in RCW 9.94A.704 and 9.94A.737.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The court may impose a sentence outside the standard sentence range for an offense if it finds, considering the purpose of this chapter, that there are substantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional sentence. Facts supporting aggravated sentences, other than the fact of a prior conviction, shall be determined pursuant to the provisions of RCW 9.94A.537.</p>
<p>Whenever a sentence outside the standard sentence range is imposed, the court shall set forth the reasons for its decision in written findings of fact and conclusions of law. A sentence outside the standard sentence range shall be a determinate sentence.</p>
<p>If the sentencing court finds that an exceptional sentence outside the standard sentence range should be imposed, the sentence is subject to review only as provided for in RCW 9.94A.585(4).</p>
<p>A departure from the standards in RCW 9.94A.589 (1) and (2) governing whether sentences are to be served consecutively or concurrently is an exceptional sentence subject to the limitations in this section, and may be appealed by the offender or the state as set forth in RCW 9.94A.585 (2) through (6).</p>
<ol>
<li>Mitigating Circumstances - Court to Consider</li>
</ol>
<p>The court may impose an exceptional sentence below the standard range if it finds that mitigating circumstances are established by a preponderance of the evidence. The following are illustrative only and are not intended to be exclusive reasons for exceptional sentences.</p>
<pre><code>a. To a significant degree, the victim was an initiator, willing participant, aggressor, or provoker of the incident.

b. Before detection, the defendant compensated, or made a good faith effort to compensate, the victim of the criminal conduct for any damage or injury sustained.

c. The defendant committed the crime under duress, coercion, threat, or compulsion insufficient to constitute a complete defense but which significantly affected his or her conduct.

d. The defendant, with no apparent predisposition to do so, was induced by others to participate in the crime.

e. The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his or her conduct, or to conform his or her conduct to the requirements of the law, was significantly impaired. Voluntary use of drugs or alcohol is excluded.

f. The offense was principally accomplished by another person and the defendant manifested extreme caution or sincere concern for the safety or well-being of the victim.

g. The operation of the multiple offense policy of RCW 9.94A.589 results in a presumptive sentence that is clearly excessive in light of the purpose of this chapter, as expressed in RCW 9.94A.010.

h. The defendant or the defendant's children suffered a continuing pattern of physical or sexual abuse by the victim of the offense and the offense is a response to that abuse.

i. The defendant was making a good faith effort to obtain or provide medical assistance for someone who is experiencing a drug-related overdose.

j. The current offense involved domestic violence, as defined in RCW 10.99.020, and the defendant suffered a continuing pattern of coercion, control, or abuse by the victim of the offense and the offense is a response to that coercion, control, or abuse.

k. The defendant was convicted of vehicular homicide, by the operation of a vehicle in a reckless manner and has committed no other previous serious traffic offenses as defined in RCW 9.94A.030, and the sentence is clearly excessive in light of the purpose of this chapter, as expressed in RCW 9.94A.010.

l. **The defendant is a survivor of domestic violence committed by an intimate partner, the domestic violence suffered by the defendant was a significant contributing factor to the defendant's criminal conduct, and the sentence would be unduly harsh given the nature and circumstances of the crime and the history, character, and condition of the defendant.**
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Aggravating Circumstances - Considered and Imposed by the Court</li>
</ol>
<p>The trial court may impose an aggravated exceptional sentence without a finding of fact by a jury under the following circumstances:</p>
<pre><code>a. The defendant and the state both stipulate that justice is best served by the imposition of an exceptional sentence outside the standard range, and the court finds the exceptional sentence to be consistent with and in furtherance of the interests of justice and the purposes of the sentencing reform act.

b. The defendant's prior unscored misdemeanor or prior unscored foreign criminal history results in a presumptive sentence that is clearly too lenient in light of the purpose of this chapter, as expressed in RCW 9.94A.010.

c. The defendant has committed multiple current offenses and the defendant's high offender score results in some of the current offenses going unpunished.

d. The failure to consider the defendant's prior criminal history which was omitted from the offender score calculation pursuant to RCW 9.94A.525 results in a presumptive sentence that is clearly too lenient.
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Aggravating Circumstances - Considered by a Jury - Imposed by the Court</li>
</ol>
<p>Except for circumstances listed in subsection (2) of this section, the following circumstances are an exclusive list of factors that can support a sentence above the standard range. Such facts should be determined by procedures specified in RCW 9.94A.537.</p>

<li>
<p>The clerk of the court in which the vacation order is entered shall immediately transmit the order vacating the conviction to the Washington state patrol identification section and to the local police agency, if any, which holds criminal history information for the person who is the subject of the conviction.
