<h2 id="section-1-2969">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-2969">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that while most employers pay their workers wages owed, provide safe working conditions, provide a workplace free from discrimination, and otherwise follow the law, violations of workplace protections persist. The legislature further finds that state resources available to rectify workplace violations are limited, which allows abuses to go unpunished. Lack of enforcement means workers work for less than minimum wage, sustain serious injuries, and suffer other violations. In addition, it is unfair to law-abiding employers to have to compete with employers that disregard the law. Therefore, the legislature intends to permit qui tam actions, allowing private persons, acting as relators, to bring public enforcement actions of worker protection laws on behalf of the state.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>No action under section 3 of this act may be commenced before written notice of the claim has been submitted by the relator to the agency, via online submission, and the relator has notified the employer by certified mail. The notice must be construed in the light most favorable to the relator, and must include the name, address, and contact information of the alleged violator; the name and contact information of the relator or the relator's legal counsel, should one exist; and a brief statement of the underlying claim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the agency intends to investigate the alleged violation, the agency must notify the relator and make a determination within one hundred eighty days of receiving the notice under subsection (1) of this section. If the agency decides not to investigate the alleged violation, it must notify the relator within sixty business days of the date it receives the notification submitted by the relator. Upon receiving notice that the agency does not intend to investigate or if the agency does not make a determination within one hundred eighty days, the relator may commence a qui tam action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As part of its investigation, the agency may attempt to remedy the alleged violation through settlement. If the settlement obtained by the agency provides the aggrieved employee or employees with a full remedy of not less than one hundred percent of any wrongfully withheld wages or benefits, including twelve percent interest per annum, and the aggrieved employees receive payment in full prior to the end of the one hundred eighty-day investigation period, the agency shall notify the relator that the agency will not commence an action and the settlement shall preclude further claims for the same wages or benefits paid in the settlement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the agency objects to the state being represented by a particular attorney proposed by the relator, the agency may file an objection to the attorney general. Upon finding, after notice and hearing, that, based on the attorney's past conduct while representing a client or clients, the attorney does not meet the required professional standards of representatives, or, alternatively, if the attorney fails to zealously pursue the remedies available under this chapter, the attorney general may, within thirty days of receiving the objection, order that the qui tam action may not be filed or maintained by the particular attorney on behalf of the relator.</p>

<li>
<p>For good cause shown, as determined by the court, after the expiration of the thirty-day period.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the agency intervenes in a qui tam action, the agency shall have primary responsibility for litigating the action and shall not be bound by an act of the relator in bringing the action. If the agency proposes to settle a qui tam action, the agency must give notice to the relator and the attorney general. The court may allow the attorney general to intervene and object to the settlement. If the agency proposes to dismiss a qui tam action, the agency must give notice to the relator and the relator must have an opportunity to be heard. The agency may dismiss or settle the action if court determines that the dismissal or settlement is fair, adequate, reasonable, and in the public interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the agency does not intervene, the relator shall have the right to litigate the action. The court must review and approve any settlement. The proposed settlement must be submitted to the agency and to the attorney general at the same time that it is submitted to the court, and the agency may present to the court its position on the proposed settlement or intervene as provided in subsection (1) of this section.

The court shall approve a settlement only upon a determination that it is fair, adequate, reasonable, and in the public interest.</p>

<p>Any settlement of a qui tam action may not be confidential.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A person may not discharge or in any manner discriminate against any employee because such employee has filed any written notice or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this chapter or has testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding or because of the exercise by such employee on behalf of himself or herself or others of any right afforded by this chapter. The commencement of a peer review process, or an action by a duly constituted quality improvement committee under RCW 70.41.200, shall not be construed to be retaliation under this section if sufficient cause to initiate the peer review process or action under RCW 70.41.200 exists independently of the action being brought under this chapter.</p>

<li>
<p>Any employee aggrieved by a violation of this section may:</p>
<ol type="a">

<p>Upon receipt of such notification, the agency shall commence an expedited investigation within ten days to be completed within thirty days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this subsection (2)(b), a rebuttable presumption is established that the discharge of any employee who engaged in any conduct allowed by this chapter within ninety days after the employee engaged in the conduct is retaliatory and in violation of section 1 of this act.</p>

<p>The employer may rebut the presumption by showing by clear and convincing evidence that it had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason to discharge the employee, which was not motivated in any part by conduct allowed by this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the employer fails to rebut the presumption, the agency shall order the immediate reinstatement of the employee. The employer may appeal the order of reinstatement pursuant to chapter 34.05 RCW.</p>
