<p>Any incorporated city or town may become a noncharter code city in accordance with, and be governed by, the provisions of this title relating to noncharter code cities and may select one of the plans of government authorized by this title. A city or town adopting and organizing under the optional municipal code shall not be deemed to have reorganized and to have abandoned its existing general plan of government, upon changing classification and becoming a noncharter code city, solely because organizing under a plan of government authorized in this title changes the number of elective offices or changes the terms thereof, or because an office becomes appointive rather than elective, or because that city or town has come under the optional municipal code, or because of any combination of these factors.</p>

If the petition is found to be sufficient, the county auditor shall file with the legislative body a certificate of sufficiency of the petition. Thereupon the legislative body of such city or town shall, by resolution, declare that the inhabitants of the city or town have decided to adopt the classification of noncharter code city and to be governed under the provisions of this title. If a prayer for reorganization is included in the petition such resolution shall also declare that the inhabitants of the city or town have decided to reorganize under the plan of government specified in the petition. The legislative body shall cause such resolution to be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation within the city or town not later than ten days after the passage of the resolution.

In the event that the first election of officers is to be held at a general municipal election, such election shall be preceded by a primary election pursuant to RCW 29A.52.210 and 29A.04.311. In the event that the first election of all officers is to be held at a special election rather than at a general election, and notwithstanding any provisions of any other law to the contrary, such special election shall be preceded by a primary election to be held on a date authorized by RCW 29A.04.321, and the persons nominated at that primary election shall be voted upon at the next succeeding special election that is authorized by RCW 29A.04.321: PROVIDED, That in the event the ordinances calling for reclassification or reclassification and reorganization under the provisions of <strong>this title</strong> have been filed with the secretary of state pursuant to RCW 35A.02.040 in an <strong>off-cycle</strong> year at least ninety days prior to a state general election then the election of new officers shall be concurrent with the state primary and general election and shall be conducted as set forth in general election law.</p>
<p>Upon reorganization, candidates for all offices shall file or be nominated for and successful candidates shall be elected to specific council positions. The initial terms of office for those elected at a first election of all officers shall be as follows: (1) A simple majority of the persons who are elected as councilmembers receiving the greatest numbers of votes and the mayor in a city with a mayor-council plan of government shall be elected to four-year terms of office, if the election is held in an <strong>on-cycle</strong> year, or three-year terms of office, if the election is held in an <strong>off-cycle</strong> year; and (2) the other persons who are elected as councilmembers shall be elected to two-year terms of office, if the election is held in an <strong>on-cycle</strong> year, or one-year terms of office, if the election is held in an <strong>off-cycle</strong> year. The newly elected officials shall take office immediately when they are elected and qualified, but the length of their terms of office shall be calculated from the first day of January in the year following the election. Thereafter, each person elected as a councilmember or mayor in a city with a mayor-council plan of government shall be elected to a four-year term of office. Each councilmember and mayor in a city with a mayor-council plan of government shall serve until a successor is elected and qualified and assumes office as provided in RCW 29A.60.280.</p>

When membership in a city council remains the same or is increased upon becoming a noncharter code city, the terms of incumbent councilmembers shall not be affected. If the number of councilmembers is increased from five to seven, the city council shall, by majority vote, pursuant to RCW 35A.12.050 and 35A.13.020, appoint two persons to serve in these offices until the next municipal general election, at which election one person shall be elected for a two-year term and one person shall be elected for a four-year term.</p>
<p>A first election of all officers upon a change in classification to a noncharter code city is also not required where the change in classification otherwise retains the same general or specific plan of government and where the change in classification results in a decrease in the number of council positions in a city.</p>
<p>If the membership in a city council is decreased from seven to five members upon adopting the classification of noncharter code city, this decrease in the number of councilmembers shall be determined in the following manner: The councilmembers shall determine by lot which two council positions shall be eliminated upon the expiration of their terms of office. The terms of the remaining councilmembers shall not be affected.</p>
