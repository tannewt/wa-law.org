<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>In 2019, the legislature enacted the long-term services and supports trust program, which imposed a .58 percent premium on wages beginning in January 2022 to pay for long-term care benefits for qualified individuals. The maximum benefits that a person may receive under this program is $36,500, which will be wholly inadequate to meet the needs of most people seeking care under the program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a 2019 advisory vote, a resounding 62.9 percent of Washington voters recommended repealing the long-term services and supports trust program. In 2020, Washington voters rejected a proposed constitutional amendment to allow further investment of program funds, resulting in a projected $15,000,000,000 unfunded liability (on a net present value basis) and necessitating future benefit cuts or premium increases to maintain the program's solvency; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new approach must be considered to replace the long-term services and supports trust program; one that encourages individuals to responsibly plan for their long-term care needs, recognizes both the long-term savings produced and the dignity preserved by allowing seniors to age in their homes, ensures coverage is affordable, leverages existing state funds, provides consumers with options, and trusts Washingtonians to make the best decisions for themselves and their loved ones.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to repeal the existing long-term services and supports trust program and replace it with a new program of state-financed reinsurance that will stabilize the private long-term care insurance market and provide Washington consumers with access to long-term care coverage that is both affordable and optional.</p>

<p>Each year the attachment point must be established by the commissioner by March 31st of the year before the applicable benefit year. The attachment point for the claims related to the 2024 benefit year shall be established as 120 percent of the total expected costs for each cohort group. The commissioner shall adjust the attachment point for subsequent years in accordance with claims history data and other information that assists the commissioner in establishing an attachment point that promotes the goals in (a) of this subsection. The commissioner shall identify cohort groups within Washington's long-term care insurance market and establish total expected costs for long-term care insurance policyholders within each cohort group. The commissioner shall identify any data needed from the program to determine the attachment point, cohort groups, and total expected costs within each cohort group for each upcoming benefit year, and such data must be timely provided to the commissioner by the program upon the commissioner's request.</p>

<li>
<p>The amount of the reinsurance payment is the amount of expense incurred by the eligible long-term care insurance issuer above the attachment point for each cohort group covered by the eligible long-term care insurance issuer that exceeds the attachment point. The amount of the reinsurance payment that eligible long-term care insurance issuers may receive for cohort groups that exceed the attachment point relevant to that cohort group may be reduced according to an offset formula established by the commissioner to account for a portion of the cohort groups covered by the eligible long-term care insurance issuer that did not exceed the attachment point. The commissioner shall consider the goals of the attachment point established in subsection (1) of this section when establishing the offset formula.</p>

<p>All long-term care insurance issuers offering long-term care insurance policies under chapter 48.43 RCW on behalf of Washington residents shall pay an annual reinsurance assessment under this section. On or before October 1, 2023, and on or before May 15th of each subsequent year, the board shall determine the reinsurance assessment for the subsequent calendar year and report the amount to the commissioner for review and approval. The gross assessment amount must be adequate to cover the total expected reinsurance claims for the subsequent calendar year plus anticipated administrative expenses not to exceed 1.5 percent of gross program assessments for the subsequent calendar year. The gross assessment amount for any calendar year may not exceed $200,000,000. The gross assessment amount calculated in 2023 may include contingency funds. The gross assessment calculated in subsequent years may not include contingency funds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each long-term care insurance issuer's reinsurance assessment must be determined based on annual statements and other reports deemed necessary by the board. The amount of the annual reinsurance assessment for each long-term care insurance issuer shall be established by a determination by the board of the total expected reinsurance claims for the subsequent calendar year and dividing the amount among all long-term care insurance issuers according to each issuer's total premiums charged to its long-term care insurance policyholders in Washington for the present calendar year as a percentage of the total premiums charged by all long-term care insurance issuers in Washington in the present calendar year.</p>

The board shall determine a payment schedule for receipt of reinsurance assessments under this section in accordance with the program plan of operation. Payment collections may be made no more frequently than quarterly.</p>

<p>Payments are due to the board within 45 days of the payment schedule determined under subsection (4) of this section. The board shall charge interest, which begins to accrue on the 46th day, on amounts received after the 45-day period. The board may allow each long-term care insurance issuer in arrears to submit a payment plan, subject to approval by the board and initial payment under an approved payment plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board may abate or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of a long-term care insurance issuer if, in the opinion of the board, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the long-term care insurance issuer to fulfill its contractual obligations. If an assessment against a long-term care insurance issuer is abated or deferred, in whole or in part, the amount by which such assessment is abated or deferred may be assessed against the other long-term care insurance issuers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments in this section. The long-term care insurance issuer receiving such abatement or deferment remains liable to the program for the deficiency plus interest at a rate established in the program plan of operation. Upon receipt of payment of any abatement or deferment by a long-term care insurance issuer, the board shall adjust future assessments made against other long-term care insurance issuers under this subsection to reflect receipt of the payment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board shall submit an annual report to the commissioner listing those long-term care insurance issuers that failed to remit their assessments.</p>

Expenditures from the account shall be used to operate the program and to make reinsurance payments to eligible long-term care insurance issuers under the program.
