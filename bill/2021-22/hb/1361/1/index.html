<p>Except where a recount or litigation is pending, the county auditor must mail ballots to each service and overseas voter at least thirty days before each special election, and at least forty-five days before each primary or general election, or any special election that involves federal office. A request for a ballot made by an overseas or service voter after that day must be processed immediately.</p>

<p>A registered voter may obtain a replacement ballot if the ballot is destroyed, spoiled, lost, or not received by the voter.

<p><strong>Within 24 hours of mailing the ballots, the</strong> county auditor shall certify to the office of the secretary of state the dates the ballots were mailed**. If the ballots are not mailed at least 18 days before the election, the auditor must notify the secretary within 24 hours of** the reason <strong>for the delay</strong> and <strong>the</strong> date the ballots will be mailed . <strong>If the county auditor has not provided such information to the secretary by the Monday 15 days before the election, the secretary must contact the county auditor to inquire about the reason for the delay and the date that the auditor expects the ballots will be sent.</strong></p>
</li>
