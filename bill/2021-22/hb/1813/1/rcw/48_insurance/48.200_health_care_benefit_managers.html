<li>
<p>The legislature finds that growth in managed health care systems has shifted substantial authority over health care decisions from providers and patients to health carriers and health care benefit managers. Health care benefit managers acting as intermediaries between carriers, health care providers, and patients exercise broad discretion to affect health care services recommended and delivered by providers and the health care choices of patients. Regularly, these health care benefit managers are making health care decisions on behalf of carriers. However, unlike carriers, health care benefit managers are not currently regulated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature finds that it is in the best interest of the public to create a separate chapter in this title for health care benefit managers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to protect and promote the health, safety, and welfare of Washington residents by establishing standards for regulatory oversight of health care benefit managers.</p>
