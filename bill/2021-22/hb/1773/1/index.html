</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A</strong> person detained under this subsection (5) must be held until such time, not exceeding five days, as a hearing can be scheduled to determine whether or not the <strong>order for less restrictive alternative treatment or conditional release should be revoked, modified, or retained</strong>. If the person is not detained, the hearing must be scheduled within five days of service on the person.

<p><strong>A</strong> person <strong>detained under this subsection (5)</strong> has the same rights with respect to notice, hearing, and counsel as in any involuntary treatment proceeding, except as specifically set forth in this section.

Notice of the filing must be provided to the court that originally ordered commitment, if different from the court where the petition for revocation is filed, within two judicial days of the person's detention.</p>

<p><strong>The</strong> issues for the court to determine are whether: (i) The person adhered to the terms and conditions of the  order; (ii) substantial deterioration in the person's functioning has occurred; (iii) there is evidence of substantial decompensation with a reasonable probability that the decompensation can be reversed by further inpatient treatment; or (iv) there is a likelihood of serious harm; and, if any of the above conditions apply, whether <strong>it is appropriate for</strong> the court <strong>to</strong> reinstate or modify the person's less restrictive alternative <strong>treatment order</strong> or conditional release <strong>order,</strong> or order the <strong>person to continue</strong> detention for inpatient treatment. The person may waive the court hearing and allow the court to enter a stipulated order upon the agreement of all parties. If the court orders detention for inpatient treatment, the treatment period must be for <strong>14</strong> days from the revocation hearing if the <strong>less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release</strong> order was based on a petition under RCW 71.05.160 or 71.05.230. If the court orders detention for inpatient treatment and the <strong>less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release</strong> order was based on a petition under RCW 71.05.290 or 71.05.320, the number of days remaining on the  order must be converted to days of inpatient treatment . A court may not  detain a person for inpatient treatment <strong>to</strong> a secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility or approved substance use disorder treatment program under this subsection unless there is a  facility or  program available  with adequate space for the person.</p>

<p>In determining whether or not to take action under this section the designated crisis responder, agency, or facility must consider the factors specified under RCW 71.05.212 and the court must consider the factors specified under RCW 71.05.245 as they apply to the question of whether to enforce, modify, or revoke a court order for involuntary treatment.</p>
