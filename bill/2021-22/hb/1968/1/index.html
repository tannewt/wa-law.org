<p>ARTICLE IV</p>
<p>EDUCATIONAL RECORDS AND ENROLLMENT</p>
<p>A. Unofficial or &quot;hand‑carried&quot; education records – In the event that official education records cannot be released to the parents for the purpose of transfer, the custodian of the records in the sending state shall prepare and furnish to the parent a complete set of unofficial educational records containing uniform information as determined by the interstate commission. Upon receipt of the unofficial education records by a school in the receiving state, the school shall enroll and appropriately place the student based on the information provided in the unofficial records pending validation by the official records, as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>B. Official education records and transcripts ‑Simultaneous with the enrollment and conditional placement of the student, the school in the receiving state shall request the student's official education record from the school in the sending state. Upon receipt of this request, the school in the sending state will process and furnish the official education records to the school in the receiving state within ten days or within such time as is reasonably determined under the rules promulgated by the interstate commission. However, if the student has an unpaid fine at a public school or unpaid tuition, fees, or fines at a private school, then the sending school shall send the information requested but may withhold the official transcript until the monetary obligation is met.</p>
<p>C. Immunizations – On or before the first day of attendance, the parent or guardian must meet the immunization documentation requirements of <strong>RCW 28A.210.070 through 28A.210.170</strong>. Compacting states shall give thirty days from the date of enrollment or within such time as is reasonably determined under the rules promulgated by the interstate commission, for students to obtain any immunizations required by the receiving state. For a series of immunizations, initial vaccinations must be obtained within thirty days or within such time as is reasonably determined under the rules promulgated by the interstate commission.</p>
<p>D. Kindergarten and first grade entrance age – Students shall be allowed to continue their enrollment at grade level in the receiving state commensurate with their grade level (including kindergarten) from a local education agency in the sending state at the time of transition, regardless of age. A student who has satisfactorily completed the prerequisite grade level in the local education agency in the sending state shall be eligible for enrollment in the next highest grade level in the receiving state, regardless of age. A student transferring after the start of the school year in the receiving state shall enter the school in the receiving state on his or her validated level from an accredited school in the sending state.</p>
<p>ARTICLE V</p>
<p>PLACEMENT AND ATTENDANCE</p>
<p>A. Course placement ‑ When the student transfers before or during the school year, the receiving state school shall initially honor placement of the student in educational courses based on the student's enrollment in the sending state school and/or educational assessments conducted at the school in the sending state if the courses are offered and if space is available, as determined by the school district. Course placement includes but is not limited to honors, international baccalaureate, advanced placement, vocational, technical, and career pathways courses. Continuing the student's academic program from the previous school and promoting placement in academically and career challenging courses should be paramount when considering placement. This does not preclude the school in the receiving state from performing subsequent evaluations to ensure appropriate placement and continued enrollment of the student in the courses.</p>
<p>B. Educational program placement – The receiving state school shall initially honor placement of the student in educational programs based on current educational assessments conducted at the school in the sending state or participation and placement in like programs in the sending state and if space is available, as determined by the school district. Such programs include, but are not limited to: (1) Gifted and talented programs; and (2) English as a second language (ESL). This does not preclude the school in the receiving state from performing subsequent evaluations to ensure appropriate placement of the student.</p>
<p>C. Special education services – (1) In compliance with the federal requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1400 et seq., the receiving state shall initially provide comparable services to a student with disabilities based on his or her current Individualized Education Program (IEP); and (2) in compliance with the requirements of section 504 of the rehabilitation act, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 794, and with Title II of the Americans with disabilities act, 42 U.S.C. Secs. 12131‑12165, the receiving state shall make reasonable accommodations and modifications to address the needs of incoming students with disabilities, subject to an existing 504 or Title II plan, to provide the student with equal access to education. This does not preclude the school in the receiving state from performing subsequent evaluations to ensure appropriate placement of the student.</p>
<p>D. Placement flexibility – Local education agency administrative officials shall have flexibility in waiving course and program prerequisites, or other preconditions for placement in courses and programs offered under the jurisdiction of the local education agency.</p>
<p>E. Absence as related to deployment activities – A student whose parent or legal guardian is an active duty member of the uniformed services, as defined by this compact, and has been called to duty for, is on leave from, or immediately returned from deployment to a combat zone or combat support posting, shall be granted additional excused absences at the discretion of the local education agency superintendent to visit with his or her parent or legal guardian relative to such leave or deployment of the parent or guardian.</p>

<p>ARTICLE VII</p>
<p>GRADUATION</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the on‑time graduation of children of military families, states and local education agencies shall incorporate the following procedures:</p>
<p>A. Waiver requirements – Local education agency administrative officials shall waive specific courses required for graduation if similar coursework has been satisfactorily completed in another local education agency or shall provide reasonable justification for denial.

<p>C. Transfers during senior year – Should a military student transferring at the beginning or during his or her senior year be ineligible to graduate from the receiving local education agency after all alternatives have been considered, the sending and receiving local education agencies shall ensure the receipt of a diploma from the sending local education agency, if the student meets the graduation requirements of the sending local education agency.

<p>RULE-MAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION</p>
<p>A. Rule-making authority ‑ The interstate commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the interstate commission exercises its rule-making authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this compact, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the interstate commission shall be invalid and have no force or effect.</p>
<p>B. Rule-making procedure ‑ Rules shall be made pursuant to a rule-making process that substantially conforms to the &quot;model state administrative procedure act,&quot; of 1981, Uniform Laws Annotated, Vol. 15, p.1 (2000) as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the interstate commission.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The interstate commission shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes.

A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default;</p>

The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorneys' fees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the interstate commission. The interstate commission may avail itself of any other remedies available under state law or the regulation of a profession.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>ARTICLE XIV</p>
<p>FINANCING OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION</p>

<p>D. The interstate commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the interstate commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws.
