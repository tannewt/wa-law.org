<p>The legislature finds that Washington benefits from its outstanding university research and health care delivery for cancer patients. The legislature finds that Washington state's citizens and its economy are benefited from the ability to attract and retain private, not-for-profit cancer research and health care delivery institutions. The legislature finds it is in the interest of the citizens of the state of Washington to promote collaboration between public universities and private not-for-profit entities in health care that will provide the highest level of cancer care for patients and advance the prevention, treatment, and cure of cancer through advanced research. The legislature intends to foster the development of cooperative and collaborative arrangements between institutions of higher education and private nonprofit comprehensive cancer centers, for the effective and efficient delivery of cancer-related clinical care and as a platform to further advance cancer-related education and research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further, the legislature intends that private nonprofit comprehensive cancer centers are not hindered in entering into such collaborations that would benefit the state of Washington and its residents by the application of certain laws governing state agencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends that private nonprofit comprehensive cancer centers in such collaborative arrangements are not state entities, or quasi-government entities, as a result of any such collaborative arrangement so long as the parties to the collaborative arrangement operate in conformance with section 2 of this act. The legislature further intends that employees of such private nonprofit entities are not state employees as a result of the collaboration so long as the parties to the collaborative arrangement operate in conformance with section 2 of this act.</p>
