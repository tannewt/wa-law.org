<p>By constitutional design, Washington's citizen legislature meets in regular session only during specified periods, rather than year-round. The legislature finds that this design promotes democracy by ensuring that legislators remain citizens of the communities that they represent. By likewise constitutional design, the appropriation authority is vested in the legislature, on the basis that tax revenues must be deposited in the state treasury and that legislation is required to authorize expenditures of moneys in the state treasury. The legislature finds that the legislature has assigned certain budgeting and expenditure powers and duties to the executive branch in the budget and accounting act, chapter 43.88 RCW and related statutes, and that these tasks are appropriately vested in the executive branch as within the governor's duty to see that the laws are faithfully executed.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that given the part-time design of our citizen legislature, it is appropriate to establish procedures for increased oversight of these delegations during the legislative interim. Given the crises facing the state and nation from COVID-19, as well as other unforeseeable but inevitable fiscal and practical challenges that the state will experience in the future, a process for legislative budget oversight will protect taxpayers and government alike.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The committee consists of:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Six members of the house of representatives, three from each of the largest caucuses, appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives, who must include the chair of the house appropriations committee or successor operating budget committee and the ranking minority member of that committee, and the chair of the house of representatives transportation committee and the ranking minority member of that committee; and</p>

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>After each regular forecast of the economic and revenue forecast council under RCW 82.33.020, the governor must conduct an analysis of the near-general fund/outlook to determine whether there is a cash deficit of the general fund as defined in RCW 43.88.050 for either fiscal year of the current biennium, or a near-general fund/outlook budget deficit of the current biennium, or both.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A near-general fund/outlook budget deficit of the current biennium occurs when the total of current allotments and other projected disbursements from the near-general fund/outlook will exceed estimated total resources for the fiscal biennium. In calculating the budget deficit, the governor must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Exclude federal moneys that are received and appropriated as &quot;general fund—federal&quot; and &quot;general fund—local;&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exclude other federal funding provided to the state, unless the funding is expressly provided to the state for the general support of state government or general state revenue replacement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exclude other state accounts and reserves outside the state general fund, including but not limited to the budget stabilization account; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rely on the most recent forecast of the economic and revenue forecast council.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within 15 days of each revenue forecast, the governor must report the results of the analysis to the joint legislative fiscal oversight committee created in section 3 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the governor's analysis projects a near-general fund/outlook budget deficit of the current biennium, the governor's analysis must include a proposed executive branch response to the deficit under the authority granted in this chapter.</p>

<p>If the governor's analysis under section 4 of this act projects either a cash deficit of the state general fund under RCW 43.88.050 or a near-general fund/outlook budget deficit of the current biennium under section 4 of this act, then within 15 days of receiving the governor's analysis the committee must hold a public hearing on the projected deficit and the governor's proposed response.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within five days after the hearing the committee must provide a written recommendation to the governor on the proposed executive branch response. The committee may adopt a recommendation on behalf of the committee if seven members vote to do so. The response to a committee recommendation may also include a minority report. If members do not adopt a recommendation on behalf of the committee, the committee must transmit to the governor any recommendations submitted by individual committee members.</p>
</li>

<p>If the legislature in the omnibus operating appropriations act has specified different permissible levels of reduction for different appropriations categories pursuant to section 7 of this act, then the governor may implement allotment reductions of varying percentage. The governor may reduce allotments of these categories by varying percentage rates, according to the limits established in the appropriations act. However, the allotment reduction percentage must be uniform within each category. Where the legislature in the omnibus appropriations act has declared that a portion of an appropriation is provided solely for a specific purpose, then the allotment reduction percentage applies to the amount so provided, unless otherwise specified in the appropriations act.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="section-7-844">Section 7 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7-844">¶</a></h2>
<p>To facilitate implementation of budget reduction options under section 6 of this act by specifying relative budget priorities, the legislature in the omnibus operating appropriations act may establish reduction categories for each section containing an appropriation from the general fund and near-general fund/outlook. For each reduction category, the legislature may specify a maximum percentage for allotment reductions made under section 6 of this act. The maximum percentages established must allow for allotment reductions sufficient to liquidate deficits under section 6 of this act.</p>

<p>Allotments of an appropriation for any fiscal period shall conform to the terms, limits, or conditions of the appropriation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director of financial management shall provide all agencies with a complete set of operating and capital instructions for preparing a statement of proposed expenditures at least thirty days before the beginning of a fiscal period. The set of instructions need not include specific appropriation amounts for the agency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within forty-five days after the beginning of the fiscal period or within forty-five days after the governor signs the omnibus biennial appropriations act, whichever is later, all agencies shall submit to the governor a statement of proposed expenditures at such times and in such form as may be required by the governor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of financial management shall develop a method for monitoring capital appropriations and expenditures that will capture at least the following elements:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Appropriations made for capital projects including transportation projects;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Estimates of total project costs including past, current, ensuing, and future biennial costs;</p>

<li>
<p>Comparisons of actual costs to estimated costs;</p>

<li>
<p>Comparisons of estimated construction start and completion dates with actual dates;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documentation of fund shifts between projects.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This data may be incorporated into the existing accounting system or into a separate project management system, as deemed appropriate by the office of financial management.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>The office of financial management, prior to approving allotments for major capital construction projects valued over five million dollars, with the exception of projects at institutions of higher education as defined in RCW 28B.10.016, which may be valued up to ten million dollars, shall institute procedures for reviewing such projects at the predesign stage that will reduce long-term costs and increase facility efficiency. The procedures shall include, but not be limited to, the following elements:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Evaluation of facility program requirements and consistency with long-range plans;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utilization of a system of cost, quality, and performance standards to compare major capital construction projects; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A requirement to incorporate value-engineering analysis and constructability review into the project schedule.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>No expenditure may be incurred or obligation entered into for such major capital construction projects including, without exception, land acquisition, site development, predesign, design, construction, and equipment acquisition and installation, until the allotment of the funds to be expended has been approved by the office of financial management. This limitation does not prohibit the continuation of expenditures and obligations into the succeeding biennium for projects for which allotments have been approved in the immediate prior biennium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If at any time during the fiscal period the governor projects a cash deficit in a particular fund or account**, other than the general fund,** as defined by RCW 43.88.050, the governor shall make across-the-board reductions in allotments for that particular fund or account so as to prevent a cash deficit, unless the legislature has directed the liquidation of the cash deficit over one or more fiscal periods. <strong>Cash or budget deficits in the general fund are governed by sections 4 and 5 of this act.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except for the legislative and judicial branches and other agencies headed by elective officials, the governor shall review the statement of proposed operating expenditures for reasonableness and conformance with legislative intent. The governor may request corrections of proposed allotments submitted by the legislative and judicial branches and agencies headed by elective officials if those proposed allotments contain significant technical errors. Once the governor approves the proposed allotments, further revisions may at the request of the office of financial management or upon the agency's initiative be made on a quarterly basis and must be accompanied by an explanation of the reasons for significant changes. However, changes in appropriation level authorized by the legislature, changes required by across-the-board reductions mandated by the governor, changes caused by executive increases to spending authority, and changes caused by executive decreases to spending authority for failure to comply with the provisions of chapter 36.70A RCW may require additional revisions. Revisions shall not be made retroactively. However, the governor may assign to a reserve status any portion of an agency appropriation withheld as part of across-the-board reductions made by the governor and any portion of an agency appropriation conditioned on a contingent event by the appropriations act. The governor may remove these amounts from reserve status if the across-the-board reductions are subsequently modified or if the contingent event occurs. The director of financial management shall enter approved statements of proposed expenditures into the state budgeting, accounting, and reporting system within forty-five days after receipt of the proposed statements from the agencies. If an agency or the director of financial management is unable to meet these requirements, the director of financial management shall provide a timely explanation in writing to the legislative fiscal committees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is expressly provided that all agencies shall be required to maintain accounting records and to report thereon in the manner prescribed in this chapter and under the regulations issued pursuant to this chapter. Within ninety days of the end of the fiscal year, all agencies shall submit to the director of financial management their final adjustments to close their books for the fiscal year. Prior to submitting fiscal data, written or oral, to committees of the legislature, it is the responsibility of the agency submitting the data to reconcile it with the budget and accounting data reported by the agency to the director of financial management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director of financial management may exempt certain public funds from the allotment controls established under this chapter if it is not practical or necessary to allot the funds. Allotment control exemptions expire at the end of the fiscal biennium for which they are granted. The director of financial management shall report any exemptions granted under this subsection to the legislative fiscal committees.</p>
