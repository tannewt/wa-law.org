<ol>
<li>
<p>In 2020, more than 2,500 Washingtonians have died due to COVID-19. State data shows that COVID-19 has disproportionately affected people who identify as Hispanic, Black, American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. The centers for disease control and prevention has identified inequities in social determinants of health as factors that contribute to racial and ethnic minority groups' increased risk of contracting COVID-19. Social determinants of health are conditions in the places where people live, learn, work, and play that affect a wide range of health and quality of life risks and outcomes. In addition, despite public health guidelines, people continue to engage in practices that contribute to the spread of COVID-19.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the office of the superintendent of public instruction, the purpose of health education is to develop health-literate students, students who acquire the knowledge and skills needed to engage in meaningful and health-enhancing lifetime behaviors. However, data shows that health literacy is very low in the United States, including in Washington state. In addition, current state health education standards and outcomes focus primarily on individual health behaviors and outcomes even though individual health behaviors and outcomes only account for half of an individual's health. These factors and others indicate current health education does not adequately provide high school students with a comprehensive understanding of how to be healthy and how to create healthy communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>COVID-19 has shown the need for every student to understand the principles of public health, including the social determinants of health, and have adequate health literacy. The legislature intends to address this need by establishing a collaborative process to strengthen state health education high school learning outcomes for the purpose of explicitly including public health concepts.</p>
