<p>a. New construction;</p>
<p>b. Increases in assessed value due to construction of wind turbine, solar, biomass, and geothermal facilities, if such facilities generate electricity and the property is not included elsewhere under this section for purposes of providing an additional dollar amount. The property may be classified as real or personal property;</p>
<p>c. Improvements to property;</p>
