<h2 id="section-1-1595">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1595">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the need for employees to have access to leave for their own use and to comply with employer requirements for quarantine and isolation. Educators and public employees have been exposed at work and have needed to use leave when dependents are ill or exposed to the virus, sometimes leading to multiple instances of required isolation and quarantine, draining the leave balances of many employees. It is the intent of the legislature to allow employees to accumulate more leave to recognize the burdens that have been placed on frontline workers during the pandemic.</p>

<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/43_state_government%E2%80%94executive/43.001_state_officers%E2%80%94general_provisions.html">43.01.044</a>.

</blockquote>
<p>As an alternative, in addition to the provisions of RCW 43.01.040 authorizing the accumulation of vacation leave in excess of <strong>280</strong> hours with the filing of a statement of necessity, vacation leave in excess of <strong>280</strong> hours may also be accumulated as provided in this section but without the filing of a statement of necessity. The accumulation of leave under this alternative method shall be governed by the following provisions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Each subordinate officer and employee of the several offices, departments, and institutions of state government may accumulate the vacation leave hours between the time <strong>280</strong> hours is accrued and his or her anniversary date of state employment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All vacation hours accumulated under this section shall be used by the anniversary date and at a time convenient to the employing office, department, or institution. If an officer or employee does not use the excess leave by the anniversary date, then such leave shall be automatically extinguished and considered to have never existed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section shall not result in any increase in a retirement allowance under any public retirement system in this state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should the legislature revoke any benefits or rights provided under this section, no affected officer or employee shall be entitled thereafter to receive such benefits or exercise such rights as a matter of contractual right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vacation leave credit acquired and accumulated under this section shall never, regardless of circumstances, be deferred by the employing office, department, or institution by filing a statement of necessity under the provisions of RCW 43.01.040.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, on or after July 24, 1983, a statement of necessity for excess leave shall, <strong>at</strong> a minimum, include the following: (a) The specific number of hours of excess leave; and (b) the date on which it was authorized. A copy of any such authorization shall be sent to the department of retirement systems.</p>

<p>All salaries and wages paid by an employer to an employee member of the retirement system for personal services rendered during a fiscal year. In all cases where compensation includes maintenance the employer shall fix the value of that part of the compensation not paid in money.</p>
</li>

<p>(A) Retroactive payments to an individual by an employer on reinstatement of the employee in a position, or payments by an employer to an individual in lieu of reinstatement in a position which are awarded or granted as the equivalent of the salary or wages which the individual would have earned during a payroll period shall be considered earnable compensation and the individual shall receive the equivalent service credit.</p>
<p>(B) If a leave of absence, without pay, is taken by a member for the purpose of serving as a member of the state legislature, and such member has served in the legislature five or more years, the salary which would have been received for the position from which the leave of absence was taken shall be considered as compensation earnable if the employee's contribution thereon is paid by the employee. In addition, where a member has been a member of the state legislature for five or more years, earnable compensation for the member's two highest compensated consecutive years of service shall include a sum not to exceed thirty-six hundred dollars for each of such two consecutive years, regardless of whether or not legislative service was rendered during those two years.</p>
<pre><code>    iv. For members employed less than full time under written contract with a school district, or community college district, in an instructional position, for which the member receives service credit of less than one year in all of the years used to determine the earnable compensation used for computing benefits due under RCW 41.32.497, 41.32.498, and 41.32.520, the member may elect to have earnable compensation defined as provided in RCW 41.32.345.

Earnable compensation shall be so defined only for the purpose of the calculation of retirement benefits and only as necessary to insure that members who receive fractional service credit under RCW 41.32.270 receive benefits proportional to those received by members who have received full-time service credit.

v. &quot;Earnable compensation&quot; does not include:
</code></pre>
<p>(A) Remuneration for unused sick leave authorized under RCW 41.04.340, 28A.400.210, or 28A.310.490;</p>

</code></pre>
<p>&quot;Earnable compensation&quot; for plan 2 and plan 3 members also includes the following actual or imputed payments which, except in the case of (b)(ii)(B) of this subsection, are not paid for personal services:</p>
<pre><code>    i. Retroactive payments to an individual by an employer on reinstatement of the employee in a position or payments by an employer to an individual in lieu of reinstatement in a position which are awarded or granted as the equivalent of the salary or wages which the individual would have earned during a payroll period shall be considered earnable compensation, to the extent provided above, and the individual shall receive the equivalent service credit.

    ii. In any year in which a member serves in the legislature the member shall have the option of having such member's earnable compensation be the greater of:
</code></pre>
<p>(A) The earnable compensation the member would have received had such member not served in the legislature; or</p>
<p>(B) Such member's actual earnable compensation received for teaching and legislative service combined. Any additional contributions to the retirement system required because compensation earnable under (b)(ii)(A) of this subsection is greater than compensation earnable under (b)(ii)(B) of this subsection shall be paid by the member for both member and employer contributions.</p>
<pre><code>c. In calculating earnable compensation under (a) or (b) of this subsection, the department of retirement systems shall include:

    i. Any compensation forgone by a member employed by a state agency or institution during the 2009-2011 fiscal biennium as a result of reduced work hours, mandatory or voluntary leave without pay, temporary reduction in pay implemented prior to December 11, 2010, or temporary layoffs if the reduced compensation is an integral part of the employer's expenditure reduction efforts, as certified by the employer;

    ii. Any compensation forgone by a member during the 2011-2013 fiscal biennium as a result of reduced work hours, mandatory leave without pay, temporary layoffs, or reductions to current pay if the reduced compensation is an integral part of the employer's expenditure reduction efforts, as certified by the employer. Reductions to current pay shall not include elimination of previously agreed upon future salary reductions; and

    iii. Any compensation forgone by a member during the 2019-2021 and 2021-2023 fiscal biennia as a result of reduced work hours, mandatory leave without pay, temporary layoffs, furloughs, reductions to current pay, or other similar measures resulting from the COVID-19 budgetary crisis, if the reduced compensation is an integral part of the employer's expenditure reduction efforts, as certified by the employer. Reductions to current pay shall not include elimination of previously agreed upon future salary increases.
