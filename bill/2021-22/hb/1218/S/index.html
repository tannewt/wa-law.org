<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Residents in licensed long-term care facilities have been disproportionately impacted and isolated by the COVID-19 pandemic and over 50 percent of all COVID-19 deaths in Washington have been associated with long-term care facilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to a University of Washington report, social isolation creates a &quot;double pandemic&quot; that disrupts care and exacerbates the difficulties of dementia, depression, suicide risk, chronic health conditions, and other challenges faced by long-term care residents and providers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A &quot;digital divide&quot; exists in many parts of Washington, particularly for older adults of color with low incomes and those in rural communities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Residents with sensory limitations, mental illness, intellectual disabilities, dementia, cognitive limitations, traumatic brain injuries, or other disabilities may not be able to fully utilize digital tools which exacerbates their social isolation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Long-term care facilities already have the legal responsibility to care for their residents in a manner and in an environment that promotes the maintenance or enhancement of each resident's quality of life. A resident should have a safe, clean, comfortable, and homelike environment as detailed in chapter 70.129 RCW; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed systematic weaknesses in the state's long-term care system and there is a need to enact additional measures to protect and improve the health, safety, and quality of life of residents.</p>

<p>Prior to admission, all long-term care facilities or nursing facilities licensed under chapter 18.51 RCW that require payment of an admissions fee, deposit, or a minimum stay fee, by or on behalf of a person seeking admission to the long-term care facility or nursing facility, shall provide the resident, or <strong>resident</strong> representative, full disclosure in writing in a language the resident or <strong>resident</strong> representative understands, a statement of the amount of any admissions fees, deposits, prepaid charges, or minimum stay fees. The facility shall also disclose to the person, or <strong>resident</strong> representative, the facility's advance notice or transfer requirements, prior to admission. In addition, the long-term care facility or nursing facility shall also fully disclose in writing prior to admission what portion of the deposits, admissions fees, prepaid charges, or minimum stay fees will be refunded to the resident or <strong>resident</strong> representative <strong>to the extent provided by law,</strong> if the resident leaves the long-term care facility or nursing facility. Receipt of the disclosures required under this subsection must be acknowledged in writing. If the facility does not provide these disclosures, the deposits, admissions fees, prepaid charges, or minimum stay fees may not be kept by the facility. If a resident dies or is hospitalized or is transferred to another facility for more appropriate care and does not return to the original facility, the facility shall refund any deposit or charges already paid less the facility's per diem rate for the days the resident actually resided or reserved or retained a bed in the facility notwithstanding any minimum stay policy or discharge notice requirements, except that the facility may retain an additional amount to cover its reasonable, actual expenses incurred as a result of a private-pay resident's move, not to exceed five days' per diem charges, unless the resident has given advance notice in compliance with the admission agreement. All long-term care facilities or nursing facilities covered under this section are required to refund any and all refunds due the resident or <strong>resident</strong> representative <strong>to the extent provided by law,</strong> within thirty days from the resident's date of discharge from the facility. Nothing in this section applies to provisions in contracts negotiated between a nursing facility or long-term care facility and a certified health plan, health or disability insurer, health maintenance organization, managed care organization, or similar entities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where a long-term care facility or nursing facility requires the execution of an admission contract by or on behalf of an individual seeking admission to the facility, the terms of the contract shall be consistent with the requirements of this section, and the terms of an admission contract by a long-term care facility shall be consistent with the requirements of this chapter.</p>
