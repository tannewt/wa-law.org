<p>The legislature recognizes that long-term care facilities are a critical part of the state's long-term care services system. It is the intent of the legislature that individuals who reside in long-term care facilities receive appropriate services, be treated with courtesy, and continue to enjoy their basic civil and legal rights.</p>
<p>It is also the intent of the legislature that long-term care facility residents have the opportunity to exercise reasonable control over life decisions. The legislature finds that choice, participation, privacy, and the opportunity to engage in religious, political, civic, recreational, and other social activities foster a sense of self-worth and enhance the quality of life for long-term care residents.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that the public interest would be best served by providing the same basic resident rights in all long-term care settings. Residents in nursing facilities are guaranteed certain rights by federal law and regulation, 42 U.S.C. 1396r and 42 C.F.R. part 483. It is the intent of the legislature to extend those basic rights to residents in veterans' homes, assisted living facilities, enhanced services facilities, and adult family homes.</p>
<p>The legislature intends that a facility should care for its residents in a manner and in an environment that promotes maintenance or enhancement of each resident's quality of life. A resident should have a safe, clean, comfortable, and homelike environment, allowing the resident to use his or her personal belongings to the extent possible.</p>

The department shall establish a release procedure for use for burial expenses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any funds in excess of one hundred dollars are paid to an adult family home by the resident or <strong>resident</strong> representative , as a security deposit for performance of the resident's obligations, or as prepayment of charges beyond the first month's residency, the funds shall be deposited by the adult family home in an interest-bearing account that is separate from any of the home's operating accounts, and that credits all interest earned on the resident's funds to that account. In pooled accounts, there must be a separate accounting for each resident's share. The account or accounts shall be in a financial institution as defined by RCW <strong>30A.22.041</strong>, and the resident shall be notified in writing of the name, address, and location of the depository. The adult family home may not commingle resident funds from these accounts with the adult family home's funds or with the funds of any person other than another resident. The individual resident's account record shall be available upon request by the resident or <strong>resident</strong> representative <strong>to the extent provided by law</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The adult family home shall provide the resident or <strong>resident</strong> representative full disclosure in writing, prior to the receipt of any funds for a deposit, security, prepaid charges, or any other fees or charges, specifying what the funds are paid for and the basis for retaining any portion of the funds if the resident dies, is hospitalized, or is transferred or discharged from the adult family home. The disclosure must be in a language that the resident or <strong>resident</strong> representative understands, and be acknowledged in writing by the resident or <strong>resident</strong> representative. The adult family home shall retain a copy of the disclosure and the acknowledgment. The adult family home may not retain funds for reasonable wear and tear by the resident or for any basis that would violate RCW 70.129.150.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Funds paid by the resident or <strong>resident</strong> representative to the adult family home, which the adult family home in turn pays to a placement agency or person, shall be governed by the disclosure requirements of this section. If the resident then dies, is hospitalized, or is transferred or discharged from the adult family home, and is entitled to any refund of funds under this section or RCW 70.129.150, the adult family home shall refund the funds to the resident or <strong>resident</strong> representative <strong>to the extent provided by law,</strong> within thirty days of the resident leaving the adult family home, and may not require the resident to obtain the refund from the placement agency or person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If, during the stay of the resident, the status of the adult family home licensee or ownership is changed or transferred to another, any funds in the resident's accounts affected by the change or transfer shall simultaneously be deposited in an equivalent account or accounts by the successor or new licensee or owner, who shall promptly notify the resident or <strong>resident</strong> representative <strong>to the extent provided by law,</strong> in writing of the name, address, and location of the new depository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because it is a matter of great public importance to protect residents who need long-term care from deceptive disclosures and unfair retention of deposits, fees, or prepaid charges by adult family homes, a violation of this section or RCW 70.129.150 shall be construed for purposes of the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW, to constitute an unfair or deceptive act or practice or an unfair method of competition in the conduct of trade or commerce. The resident's claim to any funds paid under this section shall be prior to that of any creditor of the adult family home, its owner, or licensee, even if such funds are commingled.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>In circumstances in which limitations must be placed on resident visitation due to a public health emergency or other threat to the health and safety of the residents and staff of a facility or nursing home, residents must still be allowed access to an essential support person, subject to reasonable limitations on such access tailored to protecting the health and safety of essential support persons, residents, and staff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The facility or nursing home must allow private, in-person access to the resident by the essential support person in the resident's room. If the resident resides in a shared room, and the roommate, or the roommate's resident representative, if any, does not consent or the visit cannot be conducted safely in a shared room, then the facility or nursing home shall designate a substitute location in the facility or nursing home for the resident and essential support person to visit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The facility or nursing home shall develop and implement reasonable conditions on access by an essential support person tailored to protecting the health and safety of the essential support person, residents, and staff, based upon the particular public health emergency or other health or safety threat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The facility or nursing home may temporarily suspend an individual's designation as an essential support person for failure to comply with these requirements or reasonable conditions developed and implemented by the facility or nursing home that are tailored to protecting that health and safety of the essential support person, residents, and staff, based upon the particular public health emergency or other health or safety threat. Unless immediate action is necessary to prevent an imminent and serious threat to the health or safety of residents or staff, the facility or nursing home shall attempt to resolve the concerns with the essential support person and the resident prior to temporarily suspending the individual's designation as an essential support person. The suspension shall last no longer than 48 hours during which time the facility or nursing home must contact the department for guidance and must provide the essential support person:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Information regarding the steps the essential support person must take to resume the visits, such as agreeing to comply with reasonable conditions tailored to protecting the health and safety of the essential support person, residents, and staff, based upon the particular public health emergency or other health or safety threat;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The contact information for the long-term care ombuds program; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As appropriate, the contact information for the developmental disabilities ombuds, the agency responsible for the protection and advocacy system for individuals with developmental disabilities, and the agency responsible for the protection and advocacy system for individuals with mental illness.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;essential support person&quot; means an individual who is:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>At least 18 years of age;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Designated by the resident, or by the resident's representative, if the resident is determined to be incapacitated or otherwise legally incapacitated; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Necessary for the resident's emotional, mental, or physical well-being during situations that include, but are not limited to, circumstances involving compassionate care or end-of-life care, circumstances where visitation from a familiar person will assist with important continuity of care or the reduction of confusion and anxiety for residents with cognitive impairments, or other circumstances where the presence of an essential support person will prevent or reduce significant emotional distress to the resident.</p>
