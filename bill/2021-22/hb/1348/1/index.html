<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Having access to same day and next day physical and behavioral health services is imperative to facilitate successful reentry for individuals releasing from jails;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The overwhelming majority of individuals in jails are incarcerated for less than 30 days;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suspending medicaid for individuals on short-term jail stays causes significant delays in medicaid reinstatement upon release; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delays in medicaid reinstatement impede access to physical and behavioral health appointments and prescription medications upon release.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to facilitate successful jail reentry by not suspending medicaid for individuals who are incarcerated for less than 30 days.</p>

<h2 id="section-2-1183">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-1183">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/74_public_assistance/74.09_medical_care.html">74.09.670</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/74_public_assistance/74.09_medical_care.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The authority <strong>must</strong> suspend, rather than terminate, medical assistance benefits  for persons who are incarcerated <strong>in a correctional institution, as defined in RCW 9.94.049, for 30 days</strong> or <strong>more and for persons</strong> committed to a state hospital. <strong>A person's incarceration status may not affect the person's enrollment in medical assistance prior to 30 days of incarceration in a correctional institution. After 30 days in a correctional institution, an incarcerated person must be allowed</strong> to apply for medical assistance in suspense status during incarceration and <strong>the ability to apply</strong> may not depend upon knowledge of the release date of the person.</p>
