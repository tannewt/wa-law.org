<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Having access to same day and next day physical and behavioral health services is imperative to facilitate successful reentry for individuals releasing from jails;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The overwhelming majority of individuals in jails are incarcerated for less than 30 days;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suspending medicaid for individuals on short-term jail stays causes significant delays in medicaid reinstatement upon release; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delays in medicaid reinstatement impede access to physical and behavioral health appointments and prescription medications upon release.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to facilitate successful jail reentry by not suspending medicaid for individuals who are incarcerated for less than 30 days.</p>
