<h2 id="section-1-1941">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1941">¶</a></h2>
<p>The growth management act was initially established in 1990. Since its inception, various elements of the act have been highly litigated. The costs of litigation have become burdensome on cities and counties and have had a chilling effect on growth and development especially in rural counties. In order to relieve this burden, the legislature finds that it is time to make the growth management hearings board consistent with other land use appeals.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-1535">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-1535">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/36_counties/36.070A_growth_management%E2%80%94planning_by_selected_counties_and_cities.html">36.70A.280</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/36_counties/36.070A_growth_management%E2%80%94planning_by_selected_counties_and_cities.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>

Nothing in this subsection authorizes the board to hear petitions alleging noncompliance with RCW 36.70A.5801;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section &quot;person&quot; means any individual, partnership, corporation, association, state agency, governmental subdivision or unit thereof, or public or private organization or entity of any character.</p>

</ol>
<p>4.</p>
<p>When considering a possible adjustment to a growth management planning population projection prepared by the office of financial management, the board shall consider the implications of any such adjustment to the population forecast for the entire state.</p>
<p>The rationale for any adjustment that is adopted by the board must be documented and filed with the office of financial management within ten working days after adoption.</p>
<p>If adjusted by the board, a county growth management planning population projection shall only be used for the planning purposes set forth in this chapter and shall be known as the &quot;board adjusted population projection.&quot; None of these changes shall affect the official state and county population forecasts prepared by the office of financial management, which shall continue to be used for state budget and planning purposes.</p>
