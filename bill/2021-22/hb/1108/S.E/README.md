# Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1108 as Recommended by Civil Rights & Judiciary

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/House%20Bills/1108-S.E.xml)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that whether mediation, reporting, and payment provisions of the foreclosure fairness act apply to any particular beneficiary in a given year is tied to the number of trustee's sales and number of notices of trustee's sale recorded in the preceding year. The legislature further finds that, due to the federal foreclosure moratorium in place from at least March of 2020 through December of 2020 and into the year 2021, it is likely that, absent legislative action, the mediation, reporting, and payment provisions of the foreclosure fairness act will apply to very few if any beneficiaries in calendar year 2021 or 2022 because the threshold numbers that trigger application of these provisions will not be met. The legislature therefore intends to put in place a temporary stopgap remedy so that vital assistance provisions of the foreclosure fairness act are not lost at the very time that foreclosure activity is likely to be increasing.

    c. This subsection (7) does not apply to association beneficiaries subject to chapter 64.32, 64.34, or 64.38 RCW;

    b. Reasonable diligence for the purposes of this subsection (10) means the trustee shall search in the county where the property is located, the public records and information for any obituary, will, death certificate, or case in probate within the county for the borrower and grantor;

11. Upon written notice identifying the property address and the name of the borrower to the servicer or trustee by someone claiming to be a successor in interest to the borrower's or grantor's property rights, but who is not a party to the loan or promissory note or other obligation secured by the deed of trust, a trustee shall not record a notice of sale pursuant to RCW 61.24.040 until the trustee or mortgage servicer completes the following:

Acknowledges the notice in writing and requests reasonable documentation of the death of the borrower or grantor from the claimant including, but not limited to, a death certificate or other written evidence of the death of the borrower or grantor. The claimant must be allowed thirty days from the date of this request to present this documentation. If the trustee or mortgage servicer has already obtained sufficient proof of the borrower's death, it may proceed by acknowledging the claimant's notice in writing and issuing a request under (b) of this subsection.

    b. If the mortgage servicer or trustee obtains or receives written documentation of the death of the borrower or grantor from the claimant, or otherwise independently confirms the death of the borrower or grantor, then the servicer or trustee must request in writing documentation from the claimant demonstrating the ownership interest of the claimant in the real property. A claimant has sixty days from the date of the request to present this documentation.

    c. If the mortgage servicer or trustee receives written documentation demonstrating the ownership interest of the claimant prior to the expiration of the sixty days provided in (b) of this subsection, then the servicer or trustee must, within twenty days of receipt of proof of ownership interest, provide the claimant with, at a minimum, the loan balance, interest rate and interest reset dates and amounts, balloon payments if any, prepayment penalties if any, the basis for the default, the monthly payment amount, reinstatement amounts or conditions, payoff amounts, and information on how and where payments should be made.

    e. There may be more than one successor in interest to the borrower's property rights. The trustee and mortgage servicer shall apply the provisions of this section to each successor in interest. In the case of multiple successors in interest, where one or more do not wish to assume the loan as coborrowers or coapplicants, a mortgage servicer may require any nonapplicant successor in interest to consent in writing to the application for loan assumption.

    f. The existence of a successor in interest under this section does not impose an affirmative duty on a mortgage servicer or alter any obligation the mortgage servicer has to provide a loan modification to the successor in interest. If a successor in interest assumes the loan, he or she may be required to otherwise qualify for available foreclosure prevention alternatives offered by the mortgage servicer.

    g. (c), (e), and (f) of this subsection (11) do not apply to association beneficiaries subject to chapter 64.32, 64.34, or 64.38 RCW; and

12. Nothing in this section shall prejudice the right of the mortgage servicer or beneficiary from discontinuing any foreclosure action initiated under the deed of trust act in favor of other allowed methods for pursuit of foreclosure of the security interest or deed of trust security interest.

IF YOU DO RESPOND within thirty days of the date of this letter, you will have an additional sixty days to meet with your lender before a notice of default may be issued.

You should contact a housing counselor or attorney as soon as possible.

A housing counselor or attorney can help you work with your lender to avoid foreclosure.

If you filed bankruptcy or have been discharged in bankruptcy, this communication is not intended as an attempt to collect a debt from you personally, but is notice of enforcement of the deed of trust lien against the property. If you wish to avoid foreclosure and keep your property, this notice sets forth your rights and options.";

    d. If the beneficiary has exercised due diligence as required under subsection (5) of this section and the borrower does not respond by contacting the beneficiary within thirty days of the initial contact, the notice of default may be issued. "Initial contact" with the borrower is considered made three days after the date the letter required in (b) of this subsection is sent.

    e. If a meeting is requested by the borrower or the borrower's housing counselor or attorney, the beneficiary or authorized agent shall schedule the meeting to occur before the notice of default is issued.

3. If, after the initial contact under subsection (1) of this section, a borrower has designated a housing counseling agency, housing counselor, or attorney to discuss with the beneficiary or authorized agent, on the borrower's behalf, options for the borrower to avoid foreclosure, the borrower shall inform the beneficiary or authorized agent and provide the contact information to the beneficiary or authorized agent. The beneficiary or authorized agent shall contact the designated representative for the borrower to meet.

4. The beneficiary or authorized agent and the borrower or the borrower's representative shall attempt to reach a resolution for the borrower within the ninety days from the time the initial contact is sent and the notice of default is issued. A resolution may include, but is not limited to, a loan modification, an agreement to conduct a short sale, or a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction, or some other workout plan.

        iii. A beneficiary or authorized agent satisfies the telephone contact requirements of this subsection (5)(b) if the beneficiary or authorized agent determines, after attempting contact under this subsection (5)(b), that the borrower's primary telephone number and secondary telephone number or numbers on file, if any, have been disconnected or are not good contact numbers for the borrower.

        iv. The telephonic contact under this subsection (5)(b) does not constitute the meeting under subsection (1)(f) of this section.

    c. If the borrower does not respond within fourteen days after the telephone call requirements of (b) of this subsection have been satisfied, the beneficiary or authorized agent shall send a certified letter, with return receipt requested, to the borrower at the address in the beneficiary's records for sending account statements to the borrower and to the address of the property encumbered by the deed of trust. The letter must include the information described in (e)(i) through (iv) of this subsection.

## Section 7
> This section modifies existing section [61.24.173](/rcw/61_mortgages_deeds_of_trust_and_real_estate_contracts/61.24_deeds_of_trust.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/61_mortgages_deeds_of_trust_and_real_estate_contracts/61.24_deeds_of_trust.md) for context.

1. Except as provided in subsections (5) and (6) of this section, beginning July 1, 2016, and every quarter thereafter, every beneficiary on whose behalf a notice of trustee's sale has been recorded pursuant to RCW 61.24.040 on residential real property under this chapter must:

    a. Report to the department the number of notices of trustee's sale recorded for each residential property during the previous quarter;

    b. Remit the amount required under subsection (2) of this section; and

    c. Report and update beneficiary contact information for the person and work group responsible for the beneficiary's compliance with the requirements of the foreclosure fairness act created in this chapter.

2. For each notice of trustee's sale recorded on residential real property, the beneficiary on whose behalf the notice of trustee's sale has been recorded shall remit **$325** to the department to be deposited, as provided under RCW 61.24.172, into the foreclosure fairness account. The **$325** payment is required for every recorded notice of trustee's sale for noncommercial loans on residential real property, but does not apply to the recording of an amended notice of trustee's sale. No later than January 1, 2020, the department may from time to time adjust the amount of the fee, not to exceed **$325**, at a sufficient level to defray the costs of the program. The beneficiary shall remit the total amount required in a lump sum each quarter.

3. Any adjustment to the amount of the fee, pursuant to the authority of subsection (2) of this section, shall be made by rule adopted by the department in accordance with the provisions of chapter 34.05 RCW.

4. Reporting and payments under subsections (1) and (2) of this section are due within **45** days of the end of each quarter.

Sec. 461(b)(1)(A), and that certifies under penalty of perjury that fewer than **50** notices of trustee's sale were recorded on its behalf in the preceding year.
