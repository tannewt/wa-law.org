<p>The legislature finds that whether mediation, reporting, and payment provisions of the foreclosure fairness act apply to any particular beneficiary in a given year is tied to the number of trustee's sales and number of notices of trustee's sale recorded in the preceding year. The legislature further finds that, due to the federal foreclosure moratorium in place from at least March of 2020 through December of 2020 and into the year 2021, it is likely that, absent legislative action, the mediation, reporting, and payment provisions of the foreclosure fairness act will apply to very few if any beneficiaries in calendar year 2021 or 2022 because the threshold numbers that trigger application of these provisions will not be met. The legislature therefore intends to put in place a temporary stopgap remedy so that vital assistance provisions of the foreclosure fairness act are not lost at the very time that foreclosure activity is likely to be increasing.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If the name or address of any spouse, child, or parent of such deceased borrower or grantor cannot be ascertained with use of reasonable diligence, the trustee must execute and record with the notice of sale a declaration attesting to the same.</p>

<p>Reasonable diligence for the purposes of this subsection (10) means the trustee shall search in the county where the property is located, the public records and information for any obituary, will, death certificate, or case in probate within the county for the borrower and grantor;</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Acknowledges the notice in writing and requests reasonable documentation of the death of the borrower or grantor from the claimant including, but not limited to, a death certificate or other written evidence of the death of the borrower or grantor.

<li>
<p>If the mortgage servicer or trustee obtains or receives written documentation of the death of the borrower or grantor from the claimant, or otherwise independently confirms the death of the borrower or grantor, then the servicer or trustee must request in writing documentation from the claimant demonstrating the ownership interest of the claimant in the real property. A claimant has sixty days from the date of the request to present this documentation.</p>

<p>If the mortgage servicer or trustee receives written documentation demonstrating the ownership interest of the claimant prior to the expiration of the sixty days provided in (b) of this subsection, then the servicer or trustee must, within twenty days of receipt of proof of ownership interest, provide the claimant with, at a minimum, the loan balance, interest rate and interest reset dates and amounts, balloon payments if any, prepayment penalties if any, the basis for the default, the monthly payment amount, reinstatement amounts or conditions, payoff amounts, and information on how and where payments should be made.

<li>
<p>There may be more than one successor in interest to the borrower's property rights. The trustee and mortgage servicer shall apply the provisions of this section to each successor in interest. In the case of multiple successors in interest, where one or more do not wish to assume the loan as coborrowers or coapplicants, a mortgage servicer may require any nonapplicant successor in interest to consent in writing to the application for loan assumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The existence of a successor in interest under this section does not impose an affirmative duty on a mortgage servicer or alter any obligation the mortgage servicer has to provide a loan modification to the successor in interest. If a successor in interest assumes the loan, he or she may be required to otherwise qualify for available foreclosure prevention alternatives offered by the mortgage servicer.</p>
