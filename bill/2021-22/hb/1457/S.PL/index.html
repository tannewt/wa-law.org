<h2 id="section-1-2151">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-2151">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<pre><code>a. Increasing broadband access to unserved areas of the state provides an increasingly essential public benefit to the citizens of Washington by allowing full participation in society and the modern economy, and enabling access to health care, education, the use of other technologies, and essential services, including public safety;

b. Facilitating and accelerating affordable and quality statewide broadband access for all Washingtonians will require sustained investment, research, local and community participation, and the formation of strategic partnerships between private, public, and nonprofit entities;

c. Providing for additional coordination and removal of barriers across sectors to increase broadband access in unserved areas is in the best interest of the state;

d. Maximizing the use of rights-of-way during construction or repair of transportation systems offers cost-effective opportunities for extending and improving broadband and high-speed internet connections throughout the state; and

e. Expanding broadband access, especially broadband conduit along roadways, provides commensurate benefits to the transportation system and motor vehicle users in terms of reducing the use of roads and alleviating congestion by allowing for more telework, and laying the foundation for a transportation system increasingly more reliant on autonomous vehicles.
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that there is a need to utilize near-term options and opportunities along state highway rights-of-way to drive broadband network expansion and for undertaking longer-term planning of activities to develop additional paths to facilitate the expansion of broadband networks along state highway rights-of-way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to expedite the expansion of broadband access to unserved areas throughout the state by increasing broadband infrastructure coordination, including through collaboration between the statewide broadband office and the department of transportation; proactively facilitating installation and improvement of infrastructure during state road construction projects; and studying recommendations related to the department of transportation's role in broadband service expansion efforts.</p>

<p>The department is directed to adopt and maintain an agency policy that requires the department to proactively provide broadband facility owners with information about planned state highway projects to enable collaboration between broadband facility owners and the department to identify opportunities for the installation of broadband facilities during the appropriate phase of these projects when such opportunities exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If no owners are ready or able to participate in coordination of the installation of broadband infrastructure concurrently with state highway projects, the department may enlist its contractors to install broadband conduit as part of road construction projects in order to directly benefit the transportation system and motor vehicle users by:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Reducing future traffic impacts to the traveling public on the roadway;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supporting the vehicle miles traveled reduction and congestion management goals of the state by allowing for more telework; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proactively preparing the transportation system for the widespread development and use of autonomous vehicles.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Broadband facility owners must first obtain a franchise granted by the department pursuant to RCW 47.44.010 and 47.44.020 before installing broadband facilities within the department's conduit. The costs for installation and maintenance of such broadband facilities shall be the responsibility of the broadband facility owner.

<li>
<p>Unrestricted access to and from public highways has resulted in congestion and peril for the traveler. It has caused undue slowing of all traffic in many areas. The investment of the public in highway facilities has been impaired and highway facilities costing vast sums of money will have to be relocated and reconstructed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Broadband, which includes a range of high-speed transmission technologies, including fiber optic lines and personal wireless service facilities,</strong> is a critical part of the state's infrastructure. The rapid deployment of <strong>broadband</strong> facilities is critical to ensure public safety, network access, quality of service, and rural economic development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is, therefore, the declared policy of this state to limit access to the highway facilities of this state in the interest of highway safety and for the preservation of the investment of the public in such facilities, and to <strong>ensure</strong> that the use of rights-of-way of limited access facilities accommodate the deployment of <strong>broadband</strong> facilities consistent with these interests. <strong>In furtherance of this policy, the department is directed to adopt and maintain an agency policy that requires the department to proactively provide broadband facility owners with information about planned limited access highway projects to enable collaboration between broadband facility owners and the department to identify opportunities for the installation of broadband facilities during the appropriate phase of these projects when such opportunities exist. Coordination between the department and broadband facility owners under this section must comply with applicable state and federal law including, but not limited to, chapter 47.44 RCW and RCW 47.04.045.</strong></p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>An effective department of transportation strategy, and specific highway corridors, that could be used to address missing fiber connections and inadequate broadband service in parts of the state unserved and underserved by broadband facilities while also aiding the achievement of the state broadband goals specified in RCW 43.330.536. As part of this recommendation, the following areas must also be addressed:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>What the appropriate taxonomy to apply to areas unserved or underserved by broadband is to better prioritize and contextualize the urgency of the need for broadband infrastructure in a given area; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the inclusion of broadband conduit installation in a transportation project is recommended as the most effective means of facilitating broadband access, rather than an alternative broadband facility placement, taking into account potential costs, and subject to any limitations in understanding potential costs of installation as part of a transportation project not yet undertaken;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The role of the Washington state department of transportation and the statewide broadband office in a coordinated approach for broadband development statewide on highway rights-of-way that includes the adaptation of existing programs and activities to further a state initiative to expand and improve access to broadband;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most promising planning and financing tools that could be used by the department of transportation to provide the state with greater ability to install conduit in anticipation of future broadband fiber occupancy by others;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opportunities for mutually beneficial partnerships between the department of transportation and broadband service providers that could provide broadband services for transportation purposes such as intelligent transportation systems, cooperative automated transportation/autonomous vehicles, transportation demand management, and highway maintenance activities; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strategies for the mitigation of potential safety, operations, and preservation impacts to transportation related to the recommendations made in (a) through (d) of this subsection.</p>
