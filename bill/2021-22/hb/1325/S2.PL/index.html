<li>
<p>To the extent that funds are specifically appropriated for this purpose or that nonstate funds are available, a children's mental health evidence-based practice institute shall be established at the University of Washington department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences. The institute shall closely collaborate with entities currently engaged in evaluating and promoting the use of evidence-based, research‑based, promising, or consensus‑based practices in children's mental health treatment, including but not limited to the University of Washington department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, Seattle children's hospital, the University of Washington school of nursing, the University of Washington school of social work, and the Washington state institute for public policy.

<li>
<p>Improve the implementation of evidence-based and research‑based practices by providing sustained and effective training and consultation to licensed children's mental health providers and child‑serving agencies who are implementing evidence‑based or researched-based practices for treatment of children's emotional or behavioral disorders, or who are interested in adapting these practices to better serve ethnically or culturally diverse children. Efforts under this subsection should include a focus on appropriate oversight of implementation of evidence‑based practices to ensure fidelity to these practices and thereby achieve positive outcomes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continue the successful implementation of the &quot;partnerships for success&quot; model by consulting with communities so they may select, implement, and continually evaluate the success of evidence-based practices that are relevant to the needs of children, youth, and families in their community;</p>

<pre><code>    iii. **The mental health referral service for children and teens** to facilitate referrals to children's mental health services and other resources for parents and guardians with concerns related to the mental health of the parent or guardian's child.
