<p>This section adds a new section to an existing chapter <a href="/rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.320_provisions_applicable_to_all_districts.html">28A.320</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.320_provisions_applicable_to_all_districts.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>School districts that have discontinued the provision of in-person instruction to all or most students in response to an emergency must, when resuming in-person instruction through a phased, hybrid, or otherwise noncomprehensive process, prioritize the offering and delivery of in-person instruction to the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Students in foster care;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students experiencing homelessness;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students recently released from a juvenile rehabilitation facility or other facility providing education services to students in an institutional setting, and, to the extent practicable, students in a juvenile rehabilitation facility or other facility providing education services to students in an institutional setting;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who are English language learners;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students with individualized education programs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students with plans developed under section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who have 10 or more unexcused absences within any month during the current school year.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A student who is offered a return to in-person instruction in accordance with this section may, at the discretion of the student or the student's parent or guardian, continue remote instruction until the school district resumes in-person instruction for all students. This subsection (2) does not apply to students in a juvenile rehabilitation facility or other facility providing education services to students in an institutional setting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section, &quot;emergency&quot; has the same meaning as &quot;emergency or disaster&quot; in RCW 38.52.010. &quot;Emergency&quot; may also include a national declaration of emergency by an authorized federal official.</p>
