A transportation network company that is found, after a hearing held pursuant to chapter 34.12 RCW, to be in default to the fund for assessments owed under this section is liable for the amount of the assessments determined to be due and outstanding, plus interest on the amounts owed and any monetary penalties imposed under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a transportation network company fails to pay any assessments or penalties awarded under this section within 20 days of issuance of a valid order to pay, the transportation network company is liable for all amounts wrongfully withheld, plus interest as provided for in this subsection, and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.</p>

<p>The state expressly intends to displace competition with regulation allowing a transportation network company and its drivers collectively to enter agreements with the driver resource center. The state policy is to promote the rights of drivers and transportation network companies and provide fair processes related to driver account activation. The state intends that any agreement under this section is immune from all federal and state antitrust laws. A transportation network company may, at its own volition, enter into an agreement with the driver resource center regarding the driver account deactivation process. Any agreement must be approved by the department. The department may approve an agreement only if the agreement contains the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>The agreement must provide due process for drivers who face account deactivation. Due process must include the following protections:</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) Opportunity for a driver representative to support drivers throughout the deactivation process;</p>
<p>(B) An agreed-upon just cause standard for upholding deactivations;</p>
<p>(C) Within 30 calendar days of a request, furnishing to the driver and driver representative information and evidence the transportation network company relied upon in making the deactivation decision, provided that personal identifying information is redacted to address reasonable privacy concerns;</p>
<p>(D) A good faith, substantive informal resolution process that is committed to efficient resolution of deactivation conflicts within 30 days of the transportation network company being notified of the conflict;</p>
<p>(E) A formal process for adjudication by a panel composed of peer drivers mutually selected by the transportation network company and the driver resource center and administered by a neutral third-party moderator. The panel has the authority to make binding, make-whole monetary awards, including back pay, based on an agreed-upon formula for cases not resolved during the informal process; and</p>
<p>(F) Agreement by the transportation network company to use the formal process set forth in this subsection to resolve disputes over deactivations as an alternative to individual arbitration with regard to such a dispute, should the driver so choose; and</p>
<pre><code>    ii. An ongoing process for drivers to have a voice in working conditions, including policy changes that impact their work.

b. Any agreement under this section must be submitted to the department for approval. The department shall review the agreement to ensure that its content is consistent with this subsection and the public policy goals set forth in this subsection. The department shall consider in its review both qualitative and quantitative effects of the agreement, how the agreement comports with the state policies set forth in this section, and any available business data and economic studies. In conducting a review, the record shall not be limited to the submissions of the parties nor to the terms of the proposed agreement. The department shall have the right to gather and consider any necessary evidence, including by conducting public hearings and requesting additional information from the parties. The department may approve or reject a proposed agreement, and may require the parties to submit a revised proposal on all or particular parts of the proposed agreement. If the department rejects all or part of an agreement, it shall set forth its reasoning in writing and shall suggest ways the parties may remedy the failures. Absent good cause, the department shall issue a written determination regarding its approval, rejection, or any suggestions in the event of rejection of all or part of the agreement, within 30 days of submission of the agreement.

<ol type="i">
<li>
<p><strong>&quot;Average hourly earnings&quot; means a driver's earnings from, or facilitated by, the transportation network company, during the 365 days immediately prior to the day that paid sick time is used, divided by the total hours of passenger platform time worked by the driver on that transportation network company's driver platform during that period.</strong></p>

<li>
<p><strong>Beginning January 1, 2023, a transportation network company must provide to each driver operating on its driver platform paid sick leave as required by this section and subject to the provisions of this subsection. A driver shall accrue one hour of paid sick leave for every 40 hours of passenger platform time worked.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A driver is entitled to use accrued paid sick leave upon recording 90 hours of passenger platform time completed by the driver on the transportation network company's driver platform.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For each hour of paid sick leave used, a driver shall be paid the driver's average hourly compensation.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A transportation network company shall establish an accessible system for drivers to request and use paid sick leave. The system must be available to drivers via smartphone application and online web portal.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A driver may carry over up to 40 hours of unused paid sick leave to the next calendar year. If a driver carries over unused paid sick leave to the following year, accrual of paid sick leave in the subsequent year must be in addition to the hours accrued in the previous year and carried over.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A driver is entitled to use accrued paid sick leave if the driver has used the transportation network company's platform as a driver within 90 calendar days preceding the driver's request to use paid sick leave.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A driver is entitled to use paid sick leave during a deactivation or other status that prevents the driver from performing network services on the transportation network company's platform, unless the driver's status is due to a verified allegation of sexual assault perpetrated by the driver.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If a driver does not record any passenger platform time in a transportation network company's driver platform for 365 or more consecutive days or the driver's contract with a transportation network company is terminated, any unused earned paid sick leave accrued up to that point with that transportation network company is no longer valid or recognized.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Drivers may use accrued days of paid sick leave in increments of a minimum of four or more hours. Drivers are entitled to request four or more hours of paid sick leave for immediate use, including consecutive days of use. Drivers are not entitled to use more than eight hours of paid sick leave within a single calendar day.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A transportation network company shall compensate a driver for requested hours or days of paid sick leave no later than 14 calendar days or the next regularly scheduled date of compensation following the requested hours or days of paid sick leave.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A transportation network company shall not request or require reasonable verification of a driver's qualifying illness except as permitted under subsection (1)(g) of this section.

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If a driver accepts an offer of prearranged services for compensation from a transportation network company during the four-hour period or periods for which the driver requested paid sick leave, a transportation network company may determine that the driver did not use paid sick leave for an authorized purpose.</strong></p>

<li>
<p><strong>A transportation network company shall provide each driver with: (i) Written notification of the current rate of average hourly compensation while a passenger is in the vehicle during the most recent calendar month for use of paid sick leave; (ii) an updated amount of accrued paid sick leave since the last notification; (iii) reduced paid sick leave since the last notification; (iv) any unused paid sick leave available for use; and (v) any amount that the transportation network company may subtract from the driver's compensation for paid sick leave. The transportation network company shall provide this information to the driver no less than monthly. The transportation network company may choose a reasonable system for providing this notification, including but not limited to: A pay stub; a weekly summary of compensation information; or an online system where drivers can access their own paid sick leave information.

<li>
<p>Before being used to provide commercial transportation services, every personal vehicle must be covered by a primary automobile insurance policy that specifically covers commercial transportation services. However, the insurance coverage requirements of this section are alternatively satisfied by securing coverage pursuant to chapter 46.72 or 46.72A RCW that covers the personal vehicle being used to provide commercial transportation services and that is in effect twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, a commercial transportation services provider must secure this policy for every personal vehicle used to provide commercial transportation services. For purposes of this section, a &quot;primary automobile insurance policy&quot; is not a private passenger automobile insurance policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The primary automobile insurance policy required under this section must provide coverage, as specified in this subsection (1)(b), at all times the driver is logged in to a commercial transportation services provider's digital network or software application and at all times a passenger is in the vehicle as part of a prearranged ride.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>The primary automobile insurance policy required under this subsection must provide the following coverage during commercial transportation services applicable during the period before a driver accepts a requested ride through a digital network or software application:</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) Liability coverage in an amount no less than fifty thousand dollars per person for bodily injury, one hundred thousand dollars per accident for bodily injury of all persons, and thirty thousand dollars for damage to property; <strong>and</strong></p>

<p>As an alternative to the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, if the office of the insurance commissioner approves the offering of an insurance policy that recognizes that a person is acting as a driver for a commercial transportation services provider and using a personal vehicle to provide commercial transportation services, a driver may secure a primary automobile insurance policy covering a personal vehicle and providing the same coverage as required in subsection (1) of this section. The policy coverage may be in the form of a rider to, or endorsement of, the driver's private passenger automobile insurance policy only if approved as such by the office of the insurance commissioner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the primary automobile insurance policy maintained by a driver to meet the obligation of this section does not provide coverage for any reason, including that the policy lapsed or did not exist, the commercial transportation services provider must provide the coverage required under this section beginning with the first dollar of a claim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The primary automobile insurance policy required under this subsection and subsection (1) of this section may be secured by any of the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The commercial transportation services provider as provided under subsection (1) of this section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The driver as provided under (a) of this subsection; or</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The insurer or insurers providing coverage under subsections (1) and (2) of this section are the only insurers having the duty to defend any liability claim from an accident occurring while commercial transportation services are being provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the requirements in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, before allowing a person to provide commercial transportation services as a driver, a commercial transportation services provider must provide written proof to the driver that the driver is covered by a primary automobile insurance policy that meets the requirements of this section. Alternatively, if a driver purchases a primary automobile insurance policy as allowed under subsection (2) of this section, the commercial transportation services provider must verify that the driver has done so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A primary automobile insurance policy required under subsection (1) or (2) of this section may be placed with an insurer licensed under this title to provide insurance in the state of Washington or as an eligible surplus line insurance policy as described in RCW 48.15.040.</p>

<p>Insurers that write automobile insurance in Washington may exclude any and all coverage afforded under a private passenger automobile insurance policy issued to an owner or operator of a personal vehicle for any loss or injury that occurs while a driver for a commercial transportation services provider is logged in to a commercial transportation services provider's digital network or while a driver provides a prearranged ride. This right to exclude all coverage may apply to any coverage included in a private passenger automobile insurance policy including, but not limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Liability coverage for bodily injury and property damage;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal injury protection coverage;</p>

<p>Collision physical damage coverage.</p>

<p>Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a private passenger automobile insurance policy to provide primary or excess coverage or a duty to defend for the period of time in which a driver is logged in to a commercial transportation services provider's digital network or software application or while the driver is engaged in a prearranged ride or the driver otherwise uses a vehicle to transport passengers for compensation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insurers that exclude coverage under subsection (6) of this section have no duty to defend or indemnify any claim expressly excluded under subsection (6) of this section. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to invalidate or limit an exclusion contained in a policy, including any policy in use or approved for use in Washington state before July 24, 2015, that excludes coverage for vehicles used to carry persons or property for a charge or available for hire by the public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An exclusion exercised by an insurer in subsection (6) of this section applies to any coverage selected or rejected by a named insured under RCW 48.22.030 and 48.22.085. The purchase of a rider or endorsement by a driver under subsection (2)(a) of this section does not require a separate coverage rejection under RCW 48.22.030 or 48.22.085.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If more than one insurance policy provides valid and collectible coverage for a loss arising out of an occurrence involving a motor vehicle operated by a driver, the responsibility for the claim must be divided as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Except as provided otherwise under subsection (2)(c) of this section, if the driver has been matched with a passenger and is traveling to pick up the passenger, or the driver is providing services to a passenger, the commercial transportation services provider that matched the driver and passenger must provide insurance coverage; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the driver is logged in to the digital network or software application of more than one commercial transportation services provider but has not been matched with a passenger, the liability must be divided equally among all of the applicable insurance policies that specifically provide coverage for commercial transportation services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In an accident or claims coverage investigation, a commercial transportation services provider or its insurer must cooperate with a private passenger automobile insurance policy insurer and other insurers that are involved in the claims coverage investigation to facilitate the exchange of information, including the provision of (a) dates and times at which an accident occurred that involved a participating driver and (b) within ten business days after receiving a request, a copy of the provider's electronic record showing the precise times that the participating driver logged on and off the provider's digital network or software application on the day the accident or other loss occurred. The commercial transportation services provider or its insurer must retain all data, communications, or documents related to insurance coverage or accident details for a period of not less than the applicable statutes of limitation, plus two years from the date of an accident to which those records pertain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not modify or abrogate any otherwise applicable insurance requirement set forth in this title.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After July 1, 2016, an insurance company regulated under this title may not deny an otherwise covered claim arising exclusively out of the personal use of the private passenger automobile solely on the basis that the insured, at other times, used the private passenger automobile covered by the policy to provide commercial transportation services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an insurer for a commercial transportation services provider makes a payment for a claim covered under comprehensive coverage or collision coverage, the commercial transportation services provider must cause its insurer to issue the payment directly to the business repairing the vehicle or jointly to the owner of the vehicle and the primary lienholder on the covered vehicle.</p>
