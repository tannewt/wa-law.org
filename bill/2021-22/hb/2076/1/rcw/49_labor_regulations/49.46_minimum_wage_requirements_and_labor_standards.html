<p>Whereas the establishment of a minimum wage for employees is a subject of vital and imminent concern to the people of this state and requires appropriate action by the legislature to establish minimum standards of employment within the state of Washington, therefore the legislature declares that in its considered judgment the health, safety and the general welfare of the citizens of this state require the enactment of this measure, and exercising its police power, the legislature endeavors by this chapter to establish a minimum wage for employees of this state to encourage employment opportunities within the state. The provisions of this chapter are enacted in the exercise of the police power of the state for the purpose of protecting the immediate and future health, safety and welfare of the people of this state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since the enactment of Washington's original minimum wage act, the legislature and the people have repeatedly amended this chapter to establish and enforce modern fair labor standards, including periodically updating the minimum wage and establishing the forty-hour workweek and the right to overtime pay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The people hereby amend this chapter to conform to modern fair labor standards by establishing a fair minimum wage and the right to paid sick leave to protect public health and allow workers to care for the health of themselves and their families.</p>

<p>Beginning 90 days from the effective date of this section, transportation network companies shall remit $0.15 cents of every passenger fare to the driver resource center fund, created in section 2 of this act, for the driver resource center to support the driver community. The remittance under this subsection is a pass-through of passenger fares and is not considered a transportation network company's funding of the driver resource center. Passenger fares paid include each individual trip portion on shared trips. The remittances to the fund must be made on a quarterly basis.</p>

<p>Beginning September 30, 2022, and on each following September 30th, the department shall calculate an adjusted per trip remittance by adjusting the current amount by the rate of inflation. The adjusted amounts must be calculated to the nearest cent using the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers, CPI-W, or a successor index, for the 12 months prior to each September 1st as calculated by the United States department of labor. Each adjusted amount calculated under this subsection takes effect on the following January 1st.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A driver must expressly authorize the deduction in writing to the transportation network company. Written authorization must include, at a minimum, sufficient information to identify the driver and the driver's desired per-trip deduction amount.

<p>The state expressly intends to displace competition with regulation allowing a transportation network company and its drivers collectively to enter agreements with the driver resource center. The state policy is to promote the rights of drivers and transportation network companies and provide fair processes related to driver account activation. The state intends that any agreement under this section is immune from all federal and state antitrust laws. A transportation network company may, at its own volition, enter into an agreement with the driver resource center regarding the driver account deactivation process. Any agreement must be approved by the department. The department may approve an agreement only if the agreement contains the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>The agreement must provide due process for drivers who face account deactivation. Due process must include the following protections:</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) Opportunity for a driver representative to support drivers throughout the deactivation process;</p>
<p>(B) An agreed-upon just cause standard for upholding deactivations;</p>
<p>(C) Within 30 calendar days of a request, furnishing to the driver and driver representative information and evidence the transportation network company relied upon in making the deactivation decision, provided that personal identifying information is redacted to address reasonable privacy concerns;</p>
<p>(D) A good faith, substantive informal resolution process that is committed to efficient resolution of deactivation conflicts within 30 days of the transportation network company being notified of the conflict;</p>
<p>(E) A formal process for adjudication by a panel composed of peer drivers mutually selected by the transportation network company and the driver resource center and administered by a neutral third-party moderator. The panel has the authority to make binding, make-whole monetary awards, including back pay, based on an agreed-upon formula for cases not resolved during the informal process; and</p>
<p>(F) Agreement by the transportation network company to use the formal process set forth in this subsection to resolve disputes over deactivations as an alternative to individual arbitration with regard to such a dispute, should the driver so choose; and</p>
<pre><code>    ii. An ongoing process for drivers to have a voice in working conditions, including policy changes that impact their work.

b. Any agreement under this section must be submitted to the department for approval. The department shall review the agreement to ensure that its content is consistent with this subsection and the public policy goals set forth in this subsection. The department shall consider in its review both qualitative and quantitative effects of the agreement, how the agreement comports with the state policies set forth in this section, and any available business data and economic studies. In conducting a review, the record shall not be limited to the submissions of the parties nor to the terms of the proposed agreement. The department shall have the right to gather and consider any necessary evidence, including by conducting public hearings and requesting additional information from the parties. The department may approve or reject a proposed agreement, and may require the parties to submit a revised proposal on all or particular parts of the proposed agreement. If the department rejects all or part of an agreement, it shall set forth its reasoning in writing and shall suggest ways the parties may remedy the failures. Absent good cause, the department shall issue a written determination regarding its approval, rejection, or any suggestions in the event of rejection of all or part of the agreement, within 30 days of submission of the agreement.
