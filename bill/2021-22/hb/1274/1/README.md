# House Bill 1274

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/House%20Bills/1274.xml)
## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the needs of the people of Washington for state services. From unemployment benefits to information on the incidence of disease in the state, Washingtonians have increasingly turned to state government for vital services and information.

2. The legislature further finds that the state's information technology infrastructure is outdated and with insufficient capacity to handle the increased demand and has, in many cases, not been adequate to enable the state to provide the needed services effectively and efficiently.

3. Therefore, the legislature intends to migrate the state's information technology toward modern cloud services, offered by third-party cloud providers operating at hyper scale, which will deliver the capacity, security, resiliency, disaster recovery capability, and data analytics necessary to allow the state to provide Washingtonians the services they require during this pandemic and in the future.
