<p>The legislature finds that operations of businesses in the hospitality industry have been significantly disrupted since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of these businesses, including restaurants, hotels, theaters, caterers, and nightclubs maintain state liquor licenses in order to offer their customers beer, wine, or spirits as products or amenities as authorized under the terms of their licenses. However, many licensees' businesses were completely or partially closed for much of 2020 and continue to be closed or substantially disrupted in 2021. Recognizing many licensees' inability to fully operate and use their license, and the financial hardships faced by many licensees, the legislature intends to provide relief to the hospitality industry by reducing certain liquor license fees in 2021 and 2022.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/66_alcoholic_beverage_control/66.24_licenses%E2%80%94stamp_taxes.html">66.24.146</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/66_alcoholic_beverage_control/66.24_licenses%E2%80%94stamp_taxes.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There is a tasting room license available to distillery and craft distillery licensees. A tasting room license authorizes the operation of an off-site tasting room, in addition to a tasting room attached to the distillery's or craft distillery's production facility, at which the licensee may sample, serve, and sell spirits and alcohol products authorized to be sampled, served, and sold under RCW 66.24.140 and 66.24.145, for on-premises and off-premises consumption, subject to the same limitations as provided in RCW 66.24.140 and 66.24.145.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A distillery or craft distillery licensed production facility is eligible for no more than two off-site tasting room licenses located in this state, which may be indoors, or outdoors or a combination thereof, and which shall be administratively tied to a licensed production facility. A separate license is required for the operation of each off-site tasting room. The fee for each off-site tasting room license is <strong>$1,000</strong> per annum. No additional license is required for a distillery or craft distillery to sample, serve, and sell spirits and alcohol to customers in a tasting room on the distillery or craft distillery premises as authorized under this section, RCW 66.24.1472, 66.24.140, 66.24.145, 66.28.040, 66.24.630, and 66.28.310. Off-site tasting rooms may have a section identified and segregated as federally bonded spaces for the storage of bulk or packaged spirits. Product of the licensee's production may be bottled or packaged in the space.</p>
