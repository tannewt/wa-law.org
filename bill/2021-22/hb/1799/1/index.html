<li>
<p>The legislature finds that landfills are a significant source of emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Among other economic and environmental benefits, the diversion of organic materials to productive uses will reduce methane emissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to reduce methane emissions associated with organic materials, the legislature finds that it will be beneficial to improve a variety of aspects of how organic materials are reduced, managed, incentivized, and regulated under state law. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to support the diversion of organic materials from landfills through a variety of interventions to support productive uses of organic material wastes, including by:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Requiring some local governments to begin providing separated organic material collection services within their jurisdictions in order to increase volumes of organic materials collected and delivered to composting and other organic material management facilities and reduce the volumes of organic materials collected in conjunction with other solid waste and delivered to landfills;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requiring local governments to consider state organic material management goals and requirements in the development of their local solid waste plans;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requiring some businesses to manage their organic wastes in a manner that does not involve landfilling them, in order to address one significant source of organic materials that currently frequently end up in landfills;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing legal liability risk barriers to the donation of edible food in order to encourage the recovery of foods that might otherwise be landfilled;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing the Washington center for sustainable food management within the department of ecology in order to coordinate and improve statewide food waste reduction and diversion efforts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing various new funding and financial incentives intended to increase composting and other forms of productive organic materials management, helping to make the responsible management of organic materials more cost-competitive with landfilling of organic wastes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitating the siting of organic material management facilities in order to ensure that adequate capacity exists to process organic materials at the volumes necessary to achieve state organic material diversion goals;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requiring local governments to procure more of the compost and finished products created from their organic material wastes in order to support the economic viability of processes to turn organic materials into finished products, and increasing the likelihood that composting and other responsible organic material management options are economically viable; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amending standards related to the labeling of plastic and compostable products in order to reduce contamination of the waste streams handled by compost and organic material management facilities and improve the economic viability of those responsible organic material management options.</p>

<p>Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the department of agriculture must establish and implement a three-year compost reimbursement pilot program to reimburse farming operations in the state for purchasing and using compost products that were not generated by the farming operation, including transportation, equipment, spreading, and labor costs. The grant reimbursements under the pilot program begin July 1, 2023, and conclude June 30, 2026.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this program, &quot;farming operation&quot; means: A commercial agricultural, silvicultural, or aquacultural facility or pursuit, including the care and production of livestock and livestock products, poultry and poultry products, apiary products, and plant and animal production for nonfood uses; the planting, cultivating, harvesting, and processing of crops; and the farming or ranching of any plant or animal species in a controlled salt, brackish, or freshwater environment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be eligible to participate in the reimbursement pilot program, a farming operation must complete an eligibility review with the department of agriculture prior to transporting or applying any compost products for which reimbursement is sought under this section. The purpose of the review is for the department of agriculture to ensure that the proposed transport and application of compost products is consistent with the department's agricultural pest control rules established under chapter 17.24 RCW. A farming operation must also verify that it will allow soil sampling to be conducted by the department of agriculture upon request during the duration of the pilot program as necessary to establish a baseline of soil quality and carbon storage and for subsequent department of agriculture evaluations to assist the department's reporting requirements under subsection (9) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of agriculture must create a form for eligible farming operations to apply for cost reimbursement for costs from purchasing and using compost from facilities with solid waste handling permits, including transportation, equipment, spreading, and labor costs. All applications for cost reimbursement must be submitted on the form along with invoices, receipts, or other documentation acceptable to the department of the costs of purchasing and using compost products for which the applicant is requesting reimbursement, as well as a brief description of what each purchased item will be used for. The department of agriculture may request that an applicant provide information to verify the source, size, sale weight, or amount of compost products purchased and the cost of transportation, equipment, spreading, and labor. The applicant must also declare that it is not seeking reimbursement for purchase or labor costs for:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Its own compost products; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compost products that it has transferred, or intends to transfer, to another individual or entity, whether or not for compensation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A farming operation may submit only one application per fiscal year for purchases made and usage costs incurred during the fiscal year that begins on July 1st and ends on June 30th of each fiscal year in which the pilot program is in effect. Applications for reimbursement must be filed before the end of the fiscal year in which purchases were made and usage costs incurred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of agriculture must distribute reimbursement funds, subject to the following limitations:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A farming operation is not eligible to receive reimbursement if the farming operation's application was not found eligible for reimbursement by the department of agriculture prior to transport or use under subsection (2) of this section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A farming operation is not eligible to receive reimbursement for more than 50 percent of the costs it incurs each fiscal year for the purchase and use of compost products, including transportation, equipment, spreading, and labor costs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A farming operation is not eligible to receive more than $10,000 per fiscal year;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A farming operation is not eligible to receive reimbursement for its own compost products or compost products that it has transferred, or intends to transfer, to another individual or entity, whether or not for compensation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A farming operation is not eligible to receive reimbursement for compost products that were not purchased from a facility with a solid waste handling permit.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The applicant shall indemnify and hold harmless the state and its officers, agents, and employees from all claims arising out of or resulting from the compost products purchased that are subject to the compost reimbursement pilot program under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is established within the department of agriculture a compost reimbursement pilot program manager position. The compost reimbursement pilot program manager must possess knowledge and expertise in the area of program management necessary to carry out the duties of the position, which are to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Facilitate the division and distribution of available costs for reimbursement; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manage the day-to-day coordination of the compost reimbursement pilot program.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any action taken by the department of agriculture pursuant to this section is exempt from the rule-making requirements of chapter 34.05 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In compliance with RCW 43.01.036, the department of agriculture must submit an annual report to the appropriate committees of the legislature by January 15th of each year of the program, with a final report due January 15, 2026. The report must include:</p>
<ol type="a">

<p>Whenever a unit of local government is required to make purchases from the lowest bidder or from the supplier offering the lowest price for the items desired to be purchased, the unit of local government may, at its option when awarding a purchase contract, take into consideration tax revenue it would receive from purchasing the supplies, materials, or equipment from a supplier located within its boundaries. The unit of local government must award the purchase contract to the lowest bidder after such tax revenue has been considered. However, any local government may allow for preferential purchase of products made from recycled materials or products that may be recycled or reused. <strong>Any local government may allow for preferential purchase of compost to meet the requirements of RCW 43.19A.120.</strong> Any unit of local government which considers tax revenue it would receive from the imposition of taxes upon a supplier located within its boundaries must also consider tax revenue it would receive from taxes it imposes upon a supplier located outside its boundaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A unit of local government may award a contract to a bidder submitting the lowest bid before taxes are applied. The unit of local government must provide notice of its intent to award a contract based on this method prior to bids being submitted. For the purposes of this subsection (2), &quot;taxes&quot; means only those taxes that are included in &quot;tax revenue&quot; as defined in this section.</p>

<p>The legislature finds and declares that it is the public policy of the state that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Environmental marketing claims for plastic products, whether implicit or implied, should adhere to uniform and recognized standards for &quot;compostability&quot; and &quot;biodegradability,&quot; since misleading, confusing, and deceptive labeling can negatively impact local composting programs and compost processors. Plastic products marketed as being &quot;compostable&quot; should be readily and easily identifiable as meeting these standards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Legitimate and responsible packaging and plastic product manufacturers are already properly labeling their compostable products, but many manufacturers are not. Not all compost facilities and their associated processing technologies accept or are required to accept compostable packaging as feedstocks. However, implementing a standardized system and test methods may create the ability for them to take these products in the future.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to authorize the <strong>department of ecology, cities, and counties</strong> to pursue false or misleading environmental claims and &quot;greenwashing&quot; for plastic products claiming to be &quot;compostable&quot; or &quot;biodegradable&quot; when in fact they are not.</p>
