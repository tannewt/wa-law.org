<p>This act may be known and cited as the people's privacy act.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-2240">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-2240">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Washingtonians have an explicit right to privacy under Article I, section 7 of the Washington state Constitution and this act furthers protection of that fundamental constitutional right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advances in technology and the rapid growth in the volume and variety of personal information being generated, collected, stored, and analyzed have increased harms to individual and collective privacy, making the protection of this vital right a matter of urgency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Privacy violations and misuse of personal information in the digital age can lead to a range of harms, including discrimination in employment, health care, housing, access to credit, and other areas; unfair price discrimination; domestic violence; abuse; stalking; harassment; entrapment; and financial, emotional, and reputational harms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Privacy harms disproportionately affect low-income people and people of color.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Privacy violations not only threaten the fundamental rights and privileges of Washingtonians, but they also menace the foundation and supporting institutions of a free democratic state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washingtonians are increasingly required to share personal information and are subjected to automated forms of surveillance and classification as a consequence of simply participating in public life and accessing basic social goods, services, and opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Entities that collect, use, retain, share, and monetize personal information have specialized knowledge about the algorithms and data security measures they use, as well as information about how they collect, use, retain, share, and monetize personal information that the average individual is unlikely to understand. Just as banks, lawyers, and medical providers, given their specialized knowledge, have special obligations to individuals, entities collecting intimate personal information in the digital age and benefiting from similarly specialized knowledge should have similar obligations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Privacy is the foundation of consumer trust, particularly in electronic commerce, and people will use advanced data-driven technology only if their privacy rights are respected, their personal information is safeguarded, and their freedom to choose how much personal information to share is unobstructed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state of Washington is more protective of personal privacy than many other states and has an obligation to ensure that its residents can control their personal information and are able to understand and regulate how that personal information may be used by others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requiring entities to obtain opt-in consent prior to the use or disclosure of personal information is essential to protecting personal privacy. Without opt-in consent, individuals who wish to control their personal information face an insurmountable challenge of identifying and engaging with each and every entity they encounter, while businesses lack the incentive to present individuals with meaningful opportunities to choose. An opt-in approach gives people meaningful control over their personal information while allowing businesses to choose how and whether they request consent to process that information.</p>
</li>

<p>In addition to all provisions of this chapter applicable to captured personal information, the following provisions shall be applicable to all biometric information, regardless of how such biometric information is processed.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Retention; disclosure; destruction. A covered entity or Washington governmental entity that processes biometric information must develop a written policy, made available to the public, establishing a retention schedule and guidelines for permanently destroying biometric information when the initial purpose for processing such information has been satisfied or within one year of the individual's last interaction with the covered entity or Washington governmental entity, whichever occurs first. Consent under subsection (2) of this section shall be for a period specified in the written consent of not more than one year, and shall automatically expire at the end of such period unless renewed pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. Upon expiration of consent, any biometric information possessed by a covered entity or Washington governmental entity must be destroyed. Absent a valid warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, a covered entity or Washington governmental entity in possession of biometric information must comply with its established retention schedule and destruction guidelines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Processing. No covered entity or Washington governmental entity may process an individual's biometric information, unless it first:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Informs the individual in writing that biometric information is being processed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Informs the individual in writing the details of the specific purpose or purposes and length of term for which biometric information processed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Receives a freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous written opt-in consent executed by the individual specifically authorizing such processing; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consents to processing information pursuant to the protocols for human experimentation constitutes freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent under this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disclosure. No covered entity or Washington governmental entity in possession of biometric information may disclose or otherwise disseminate an individual's biometric information unless:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The individual gives freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent in writing to the disclosure or redisclosure;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The disclosure or redisclosure is used solely to complete a financial transaction requested or authorized by the subject of the biometric information;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The disclosure or redisclosure is required by state or federal law; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The disclosure is required pursuant to a valid warrant or subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or a subpoena issued by a governmental entity or in a pending judicial case, provided that in the case of a subpoena the entity subject to the subpoena shall postpone compliance therewith until it has given the subject of the subpoena notice of the facts set forth in section 9(2)(b)(i) of this act has allowed at least 10 business days for the subject to seek review of or otherwise challenge the subpoena.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monetizing. No covered entity or Washington governmental entity in possession of biometric information may monetize, or otherwise profit from an individual's biometric information; provided only that a covered entity may process an individual's biometric information, with full disclosure and opt-in consent consistent with section 5(2) of this act, in a service in which the covered entity reports to the individual the biometric information processed and/or utilizes the biometric information to design or recommend actions or products that have been specifically requested by the individual with full disclosure that such recommendation is based on the biometric information processed, provided that the biometric information shall not be used for any other purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identification. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a covered entity or governmental entity may list personal information such as name or birthdate and biometric information such as height, weight, or photograph on an issued license, membership or identification card for the sole purpose of allowing an employee or other representative of the covered entity to determine based solely on personal observation, and without the assistance of technologies such as facial recognition, whether the person physically holding such license or card is the person entitled to hold it, provided further that such intended use is disclosed to the individual prior to capturing the biometric information. Any other processing of such biometric information shall be subject to all the terms and conditions of this chapter. Any covered entity or governmental entity using personal information or biometric information under this subsection must ensure that it is not stored or processed in any manner that would allow a third party to process such information for any purpose.</p>

<li>
<p>The request shall document the factual basis for believing that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to an individual requires obtaining without delay captured personal information relating to the emergency; and</p>

    iii. In the case of a subpoena, a covered entity subject to a subpoena shall postpone compliance therewith until it has given the subject of the subpoena notice of the information required under this subsection (2)(b)(i) and has allowed at least 10 business days for the subject to seek review of or otherwise challenge the subpoena;
