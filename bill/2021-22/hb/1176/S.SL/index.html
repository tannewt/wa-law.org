When the <strong>student</strong> and parent or guardian are unable to pay for the damages, the school district shall provide a program of <strong>community service</strong> for the <strong>student</strong> in lieu of the payment of monetary damages. Upon completion of <strong>community service</strong> the  diploma of the <strong>student must</strong> be released. The parent or guardian of <strong>the student</strong> shall be liable for damages as otherwise provided by law.</p>

<p>Before <strong>the diploma is withheld</strong> under this section, a school district board of directors shall adopt procedures which insure that <strong>students'</strong> rights to due process are protected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the department of social and health services or a child-placing agency licensed by the department has been granted custody of a child, that child's records, if requested by the department or agency, are not to be withheld for nonpayment of school fees or any other reason.</p>

In addition, upon enrollment of a student who is dependent pursuant to chapter 13.34 RCW, the school district must make reasonable efforts to obtain and assess that child's educational history in order to meet the child's unique needs within two business days.</p>
