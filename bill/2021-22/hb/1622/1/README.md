## Section 1
The legislature finds that:

1. Most organizations recognize that the didactic training of health care professionals performing the medical forensic examination should consist of at least 40 hours;

2. Training of sexual assault nurse examiners should include hands-on clinical skills training and competency checks;

3. Disparities persist between the training that is available to nurses in rural communities, including a lack of hands-on clinical skills training and a lack of 40-hour didactic classes;

4. Best practice for the clinical education of nurses includes the use of simulation in an interdisciplinary context;

5. Promotion of equal access to 40-hour didactic classes and supporting the development of clinical training mechanisms will help to ensure consistency and quality of care throughout the state; and

6. Washington State University has the capacity to offer high quality, simulation-based, inter-professional training for sexual assault nurse examiners and to increase access to education for nurses in rural communities.
