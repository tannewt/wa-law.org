## Section 1
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [66.24](/rcw/66_alcoholic_beverage_control/66.24_licenses—stamp_taxes.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/66_alcoholic_beverage_control/66.24_licenses—stamp_taxes.md) for context.

1. There is a limited spirits retail license to:

    a. Sell spirits in original containers to consumers for consumption off the licensed premises and to permit holders; and

    b. Export spirits.

2. For the purposes of this title, a limited spirits retail license is a retail license, and a sale by a limited spirits retailer is a retail sale.

3. [Empty]

    a. Except as otherwise provided in (c) or (e) of this subsection, the board may issue limited spirits retail licenses to applicants holding licenses for off-premises sales of either beer or wine, or both, issued pursuant to RCW 66.24.360(1), but only to applicants that:

        i. Do not hold any endorsement issued pursuant to RCW 66.24.360 (2), (3), (6), or (10);

        ii. Do not hold a restricted license issued pursuant to RCW 66.24.360(7);

        iii. Satisfy all reasonable requirements imposed by statute or regulation for issuance of a retail liquor license, including any enhanced employee training requirements required by the board for holders of limited spirits retail licenses;

        iv. The board determines will maintain systems for inventory management, employee training, employee supervision, and physical security of the product substantially as effective with respect to preventing sales to, or pilferage by, underage or inebriated persons as those systems currently used by stores holding spirits retail licenses issued pursuant to RCW 66.24.630;

    v. The board determines have not committed more than one safety violation within the three years preceding the filing of the application; and

    vi. Except as provided in (e) of this subsection, the board determines are not located, or proposed to be located, within a one-mile radius of a spirits retail licensee who is operating on the effective date of this section and obtained the spirits retail license for the location through rights purchased at the auction held under RCW 66.24.620.

    b. [Empty]

        i. License issuances and renewals pursuant to this section are subject to RCW 66.24.010 and the regulations adopted thereunder, including, without limitation, rights of the public, churches, schools, and public institutions to object to local liquor licenses.

        ii. Nothing in this section prevents a city, town, or county legislative authority from adopting an ordinance or resolution that institutes a ban or moratorium on the issuance of a limited spirits retail license within its jurisdiction.

    c. The board may deny a limited spirits retail license to an otherwise qualified applicant if:

        i. The board reasonably determines that issuance of the limited spirits retail license to the applicant would not be in the best interests of the community to be served by the applicant because it would result in an excessive number of locations where spirits could be purchased in the community;

        ii. The board reasonably determines that issuance of the limited spirits retail license to the applicant would otherwise pose an unacceptable risk to the health and welfare of the community to be served; or

        iii. Issuance of the limited spirits retail license would cause the total number of liquor licenses for the sale of alcohol for off-premises consumption to exceed any limits imposed by the legislature on the number of licenses permitted to be active in the state or any defined portion of the state at the time the application is processed.

    d. Any spirits sold by the holder of a limited spirits retailer license must have been purchased from a spirits distributor licensed to do business within the state of Washington or from a licensed distiller or licensed craft distiller authorized to sell spirits to a retail licensee for off-premises consumption.

    e. Three years after the effective date of this section the board shall stop using (a)(vi) of this subsection as a basis for denying a limited spirits retail license to an otherwise qualified applicant.

4. Each limited spirits retail licensee must pay to the board, for deposit into the liquor revolving fund, a license issuance fee equivalent to seventeen percent of all spirits sales revenues under the license, exclusive of taxes collected by the licensee and of sales of items on which a license fee payable under this section has otherwise been incurred. The board must establish rules setting forth the timing of the payments and reporting of sales dollar volume by the licensee, with payments required quarterly in arrears.

5. In addition to the payments required under subsection (4) of this section, each limited spirits retail licensee must pay an annual license renewal fee of one hundred sixty-six dollars. The board must periodically review and adjust the renewal fee as may be required to maintain it as comparable to annual license renewal fees for spirits retail licenses issued pursuant to RCW 66.24.630 or 66.24.035. If required by law at the time, any increase of the annual renewal fee becomes effective only upon ratification by the legislature.

6. As a condition to receiving and renewing a limited spirits retail license, the licensee must provide training to all individuals who sell spirits or who manage others who sell spirits regarding compliance with the laws and regulations regarding the sale of spirits, including, without limitation, the prohibitions against the sale of spirits to individuals who are underage or visibly intoxicated. The training must be provided before the individual first engages in the sale of spirits and must be renewed at least every five years. The licensee must maintain records documenting the nature and frequency of the training provided. An employee training program is presumptively sufficient if it incorporates all enhanced employee training requirements required by the board for holders of limited spirits retail licenses.

7. The maximum penalties prescribed by the board in WAC 314-29-020 through 314-29-040 relating to fines and suspensions are doubled for violations relating to the sale of spirits by limited spirits retail licensees. Licensees who comply with all employee training and education requirements established by the board for limited spirits retail licensees are not subject to the doubling of penalties provided in this section for a single violation in any period of twelve calendar months.

8. Limited spirits retail licensees must comply with all laws and regulations governing spirits retail licensees, except to the extent that doing so would result in a violation of, or failure to fully comply with, this section.

## Section 3
> This section modifies existing section [66.24.055](/rcw/66_alcoholic_beverage_control/66.24_licenses—stamp_taxes.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/66_alcoholic_beverage_control/66.24_licenses—stamp_taxes.md) for context.

1. There is a license for spirits distributors to (a) sell spirits purchased from manufacturers, distillers, or suppliers including, without limitation, licensed Washington distilleries, licensed spirits importers, other Washington spirits distributors, or suppliers of foreign spirits located outside of the United States, to spirits retailers including, without limitation, spirits retail licensees, special occasion license holders, interstate common carrier license holders, restaurant spirits retailer license holders, spirits, beer, and wine private club license holders, hotel license holders, sports entertainment facility license holders, and spirits, beer, and wine nightclub license holders, and to other spirits distributors; and (b) export the same from the state.

2.

    a. As limited by (b) of this subsection , each spirits distributor licensee must pay to the board, for deposit into the liquor revolving fund, a license issuance fee calculated as

five percent of the total revenue from all the licensee's sales of spirits made during the month for which the fee is due, respectively.

    b. The fee required under this subsection (2) is calculated only on sales of items which the licensee was the first spirits distributor in the state to have received:

        i. In the case of spirits manufactured in the state, from the distiller; or

        ii. In the case of spirits manufactured outside the state, from an authorized out‑of‑state supplier.

    c.

A retail licensee selling for resale must pay a distributor license fee under the terms and conditions in this section on resales of spirits the licensee has purchased on which no other distributor license fee has been paid. **A limited spirits retail licensee selling for resale must also pay a distributor license fee under the terms and conditions in this section on resales of spirits the licensee has purchased on which no other distributor license fee has been paid. The limited spirits retail licensee must report these sales and the funds must be designated as mitigation fee funds.** The board must establish rules setting forth the frequency and timing of such payments and reporting of sales dollar volume by the licensee, with payments due quarterly in arrears. **The board must process and distribute mitigation fee funds paid under this section in the same manner and subject to the same regulations as the mitigation fees established in section 2 of this act.**

    d. No spirits inventory may be subject to calculation of more than a single spirits distributor license issuance fee.

3. In addition to the payment set forth in subsection (2) of this section, each spirits distributor licensee renewing its annual license must pay an annual license renewal fee of one thousand three hundred twenty dollars for each licensed location.

4. There is no minimum facility size or capacity for spirits distributor licenses, and no limit on the number of such licenses issued to qualified applicants. License applicants must provide physical security of the product that is substantially as effective as the physical security of the distribution facilities currently operated by the board with respect to preventing pilferage. License issuances and renewals are subject to RCW 66.24.010 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, including without limitation rights of cities, towns, county legislative authorities, the public, churches, schools, and public institutions to object to or prevent issuance of local liquor licenses.
