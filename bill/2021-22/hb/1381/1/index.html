<p>The governor shall give as much public notice as practical through the news media of the issuance of proclamations or orders pursuant to RCW 43.06.010, and 43.06.200 through 43.06.270 as now or hereafter amended.</p>

<p>The governor after proclaiming a state of emergency and prior to terminating such, may, in the area described by the proclamation issue an order prohibiting:</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>The manufacture, transfer, use, possession or transportation of a molotov cocktail or any other device, instrument or object designed to explode or produce uncontained combustion;</p>

<p><strong>During the 14 days after the</strong> governor <strong>proclaims</strong> a state of emergency <strong>, the governor</strong> may, in the <strong>geographic</strong> area described by the proclamation, issue an order or orders concerning waiver or suspension of statutory obligations or limitations <strong>as described in this subsection. After those 14 days, a waiver or suspension may continue only if extended by the legislature through concurrent resolution approved by a two-thirds vote in both the house of representatives and the senate. An order may waive or suspend statutory obligations or limitations only</strong> in the following <strong>subject</strong> areas:</p>
<ol type="a">

<p>Liability for participation in interlocal agreements;</p>

<p>Such other statutory and regulatory obligations or limitations prescribing the procedures for conduct of state business, or the orders, rules, or regulations of any state agency if strict compliance with the provision of any statute, order, rule, or regulation would  prevent, hinder, or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency, unless (i) authority to waive or suspend a specific statutory or regulatory obligation or limitation has been expressly granted to another statewide elected official <strong>prior to the state of emergency</strong>, (ii) the waiver or suspension would conflict with federal requirements that are a prescribed condition to the allocation of federal funds to the state, or (iii) the waiver or suspension would conflict with <strong>any of</strong> the <strong>freedoms and</strong> rights <strong>of the people</strong>, under the <strong>Washington state or United States Constitutions</strong>. The governor shall give as much notice as practical to <strong>all members of the legislature directly</strong> and impacted local governments when issuing orders**, or any changes relating to those orders,** under this subsection (2)(g).</p>

<li>
<p>No order or orders concerning waiver or suspension of statutory obligations or limitations under subsection (2) of this section may continue for longer than <strong>14</strong> days unless extended by the legislature through concurrent resolution <strong>approved by a two-thirds vote in both the house of representatives and the senate</strong>.

<p>(a) <strong>An agency may not adopt an emergency rule under this section that responds or relates to:</strong></p>
<pre><code> i. **A state of emergency declared by the governor under RCW 43.06.010; or**

 ii. **Legislation that responds or relates to such a governor-declared state of emergency.**
</code></pre>
<ol type="a" start="2">
<li>
<p><strong>An agency may not amend or repeal an existing rule in response to a governor-declared state of emergency, unless:</strong></p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p><strong>The governor expressly authorizes the agency to do so by a proclamation issued within the first 14 days after a state of emergency is declared; or</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The legislature expressly authorizes the agency to do so in legislation passed by a two-thirds vote in both the house of representatives and the senate.</strong></p>

<p><strong>An agency is instead limited to:</strong></p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p><strong>Executing the provisions of the governor's proclamations during the initial 14 days of the emergency; and</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Executing the provisions of legislation responding or relating to the emergency that has been approved by a two-thirds vote in both the house of representatives and the senate.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Except as provided in subsection (1) of this section, if</strong> an agency for good cause finds:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>That immediate adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule is necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety, or general welfare, and that observing the time requirements of notice and opportunity to comment upon adoption of a permanent rule would be contrary to the public interest; <strong>or</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That state or federal law or federal rule or a federal deadline for state receipt of federal funds requires immediate adoption of a rule</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>,</p>
<p>the agency may dispense with those requirements and adopt, amend, or repeal the rule on an emergency basis. The agency's finding and a concise statement of the reasons for its finding shall be incorporated in the order for adoption of the emergency rule or amendment filed with the office of the code reviser under RCW 34.05.380 and with the rules review committee.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>An emergency rule adopted under this section takes effect upon filing with the code reviser, unless a later date is specified in the order of adoption, and may not remain in effect for longer than <strong>90</strong> days after filing. Identical or substantially similar emergency rules may not be adopted in sequence unless conditions have changed or the agency has filed notice of its intent to adopt the rule as a permanent rule, and is actively undertaking the appropriate procedures to adopt the rule as a permanent rule. This section does not relieve any agency from compliance with any law requiring that its permanent rules be approved by designated persons or bodies before they become effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within seven days after the rule is adopted, any person may petition the governor requesting the immediate repeal of a rule adopted on an emergency basis by any department listed in RCW 43.17.010. Within seven days after submission of the petition, the governor shall either deny the petition in writing, stating his or her reasons for the denial, or order the immediate repeal of the rule.  If the governor orders the repeal of the emergency rule, any sanction imposed based on that rule is void.</p>
