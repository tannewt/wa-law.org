<h2 id="section-1-3169">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-3169">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that digital electronic equipment is often designed to be unrepairable by end users and independent repair shops, or repairable only at great expense. The legislature further finds that such design choices by original equipment manufacturers: Encourage consumers to purchase new devices instead of maintaining current devices; generate harmful electronic waste that clutters homes and landfills; damage the environment; waste finite resources that are essential to the manufacturing and functioning of digital electronic equipment; and impose an inequitable burden on individuals and groups that cannot readily afford to routinely replace expensive digital electronic equipment that has become an increasingly essential predicate to full participation in society. The legislature further finds that most digital electronic equipment is not currently marketed and sold with clear information on repairability, and thus consumers lack essential information they need when deciding whether to purchase digital electronic equipment. The legislature further finds that increased access to repairable digital electronic equipment will empower consumers, reduce electronic waste, reduce the costs of owning digital electronic equipment over time, and reduce inequities in access to digital electronic equipment.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to require original equipment manufacturers of digital electronic equipment to assign a repairability score to all digital electronic equipment, and to clearly label all digital electronic equipment with its repairability score and other information that will assist consumers in identifying and purchasing repairable digital electronic equipment. The legislature further intends to require certain high volume sellers of digital electronic equipment to include the original equipment manufacturers' repairability scores and information in internet listings for digital electronic equipment. The legislature further intends to empower the department to develop and enforce standards for digital electronic equipment repairability scores. The legislature further intends to supplement the department's regulatory authority by providing the state and consumers with additional options for enforcing the requirements of this act through the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW. The legislature further intends to establish a commission on digital electronic equipment repairability to prepare reports and recommendations to the legislature related to developing local repairability standards that are compatible with emerging national and global repairability standards.</p>
