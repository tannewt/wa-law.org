# House Bill 1678

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/House%20Bills/1678.xml)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that domestic violence is a serious and pervasive issue facing many Washington families and communities, and many of the most severe crimes that occur in this state are those involving intimate partner and family violence. Domestic violence offenses carry wide ranging effects, including injury to mental and physical health, erosion of economic and housing stability, and vicarious victimization of children, who are often bystander witnesses. Washington state data demonstrates a high rate of reoffense among perpetrators of domestic violence, and there is currently no way of knowing whether any particular person has an offense history in absence of a criminal background check or court records request.

The establishment of a searchable public registry of serious domestic violence offenders is an important step toward preventing future victimization and reducing overall rates of domestic violence. The legislature does not intend for the registry to be punitive or an extension of punishment. Instead, it serves as a reasonable regulatory scheme designed to facilitate public access to identification and relevant criminal history information for a subset of particularly dangerous domestic violence offenders with repeated or felony-level offenses. Members of the public have a compelling interest in identifying serious domestic violence offenders so that they may make informed decisions in furtherance of personal security.

## Section 7
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [10.99](/rcw/10_criminal_procedure/10.099_domestic_violence—official_response.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/10_criminal_procedure/10.099_domestic_violence—official_response.md) for context.

1. Except as provided in subsection (2) this section, a serious domestic violence offender may petition the superior court for removal from the serious domestic violence offender registry when he or she has spent 10 consecutive years in the community without being convicted of any felony or any domestic violence offense during that time period.

2. A serious domestic violence offender whose appearance on the serious domestic violence offender registry is based exclusively on one or more domestic violence offenses committed as a juvenile may petition for removal from the serious domestic violence offender registry under the following timelines:

    a. If the offense or offenses requiring registration include any class A felony domestic violence offenses, the offender may petition when: (i) At least five years have passed since the petitioner's adjudication and completion of any term of confinement for the offense or offenses giving rise to inclusion on the registry; and (ii) the petitioner has not been adjudicated or convicted of any felony or any domestic violence offenses within the five years before the petition.

    b. For all other domestic violence offenses committed by a juvenile not included in (a) of this subsection, the offender may petition when: (i) At least 24 months have passed since the petitioner's adjudication and completion of any term of confinement for the offense giving rise to inclusion on the registry; and (ii) the petitioner has not been adjudicated or convicted of any felony or any domestic violence offenses within the 24 months before the petition.

3. A petition for relief from registration must be made to the court in which the petitioner was ordered to be included on the serious domestic violence offender registry. The prosecuting attorney of the county must be named and served as the respondent in any petition. The prosecuting attorney must make reasonable efforts to notify the victim via the victim's choice of telephone, letter, or email, if known.

4. [Empty]

    a. The court may order the petitioner's removal from the registry only if the petitioner shows by clear and convincing evidence that the petitioner is sufficiently rehabilitated to warrant removal from the registry. If the petitioner's inclusion on the registry is based entirely on offenses committed while the petitioner was a juvenile, the petitioner's burden of proof shall be a preponderance of the evidence that the petitioner is sufficiently rehabilitated to warrant removal from the registry.

    b. In determining whether the petitioner is sufficiently rehabilitated to warrant removal from the registry, the following factors are provided as guidance to assist the court in making its determination:

        i. The nature of the domestic violence offenses committed, including the number of victims and the length of the offense history;

        ii. Any subsequent criminal history;

        iii. The petitioner's compliance with any applicable supervision requirements;

        iv. The length of time since the charged incident or incidents occurred;

    v. Any input from community corrections officers, law enforcement, treatment providers, or other criminal justice professionals;

    vi. The petitioner's stability in employment and housing;

    vii. The petitioner's community and personal support system;

    viii. Any risk assessments or evaluations prepared by a qualified professional; and

        ix. Any other factors the court may consider relevant.

5. If a serious domestic violence offender's entry on the registry lists an offense for which the conviction is subsequently overturned or otherwise set aside by court order on grounds consistent with innocence, the serious domestic violence offender may petition the court for removal of the offense from the registry. If the court finds that the offense conviction has been overturned or otherwise set aside by court order on grounds consistent with innocence, the court may order that the offense be removed from the registry.

6. If a person is granted an order of removal from the registry or removal of an offense from the registry pursuant to this section, the order of removal does not constitute a certificate of rehabilitation, or the equivalent of a certificate of rehabilitation, for the purposes of restoration of firearm possession under RCW 9.41.040.

7. If the court orders removal from the registry or removal of an offense from the registry, the court must send a copy of the order to the Washington state patrol. The Washington state patrol must remove the person from the registry within 30 calendar days.
