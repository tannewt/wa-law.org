<p>The legislature finds that the mortality rate in Washington state due to overdose and suicide is unacceptably high and that such mortality may be preventable. The legislature further finds that, through the performance of overdose or suicide fatality reviews, preventable causes of mortality can be identified and addressed, thereby reducing the number of overdose and suicide fatalities in Washington state.</p>
