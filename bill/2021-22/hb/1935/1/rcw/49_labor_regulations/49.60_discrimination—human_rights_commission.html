<p>This chapter shall be known as the &quot;law against discrimination.&quot; It is an exercise of the police power of the state for the protection of the public welfare, health, and peace of the people of this state, and in fulfillment of the provisions of the Constitution of this state concerning civil rights. The legislature hereby finds and declares that practices of discrimination against any of its inhabitants because of race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immigration status, families with children, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, age, honorably discharged veteran or military status, or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal by a person with a disability are a matter of state concern, that such discrimination threatens not only the rights and proper privileges of its inhabitants but menaces the institutions and foundation of a free democratic state. A state agency is herein created with powers with respect to elimination and prevention of discrimination in employment, in credit and insurance transactions, in places of public resort, accommodation, or amusement, and in real property transactions because of race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immigration status, families with children, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, age, honorably discharged veteran or military status, or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal by a person with a disability; and the commission established hereunder is hereby given general jurisdiction and power for such purposes.</p>

<p>The provisions of this chapter shall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the purposes thereof. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be deemed to repeal any of the provisions of any other law of this state relating to discrimination because of race, color, creed, national origin, citizenship or immigration status, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, age, honorably discharged veteran or military status, or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability, other than a law which purports to require or permit doing any act which is an unfair practice under this chapter. However, to the extent that distinction or differential treatment on the basis of citizenship or immigration status is authorized by federal or state law, regulation, or government contract, it is not an unfair practice. Nor shall anything herein contained be construed to deny the right to any person to institute any action or pursue any civil or criminal remedy based upon an alleged violation of his or her civil rights. This chapter shall not be construed to endorse any specific belief, practice, behavior, or orientation. Inclusion of sexual orientation in this chapter shall not be construed to modify or supersede state law relating to marriage.</p>

<p>It shall be a civil infraction under chapter 7.80 RCW for any person to misrepresent an animal as a service animal. A violation of this section occurs when a person:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Expressly or impliedly represents that an animal is a service animal as defined in RCW 49.60.040 for the purpose of securing the rights or privileges afforded disabled persons accompanied by service animals set forth in state or federal law; and</p>

<p>Knew or should have known that the animal in question did not meet the definition of a service animal.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>An enforcement officer as defined under RCW 7.80.040 may investigate and enforce this section by making an inquiry of the person accompanied by the animal in question and issuing a civil infraction. Refusal to answer the questions allowable under (b) of this subsection shall create a presumption that the animal is not a service animal and the enforcement officer may issue a civil infraction and require the person to remove the animal from the place of public accommodation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An enforcement officer or place of public accommodation shall not ask about the nature or extent of a person's disability, but may make two inquiries to determine whether an animal qualifies as a service animal. An enforcement officer or place of public accommodation may ask if the animal is required because of a disability and what work or task the animal has been trained to perform. An enforcement officer or place of public accommodation shall not require documentation, such as proof that the animal has been certified, trained, or licensed as a service animal, or require that the service animal demonstrate its task. Generally, an enforcement officer or place of public accommodation may not make these inquiries about a service animal when it is readily apparent that an animal is trained to do work or perform tasks for a person with a disability, such as a dog is observed guiding a person who is blind or has low vision, pulling a person's wheelchair, or providing assistance with stability or balance to a person with an observable mobility disability.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A place of public accommodation shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures to permit the use of a miniature horse by an individual with a disability in accordance with *RCW 49.60.040(24) if the miniature horse has been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of the individual with a disability. In determining whether reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures can be made to allow a miniature horse into a facility, a place of public accommodation shall act in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.</p>

Sec. 3601 et seq.), and injunctive or other equitable relief. Such order may, to further the public interest, assess a civil penalty against the respondent:</p>

<li>
<p>In an amount up to ten thousand dollars if the respondent has not been determined to have committed any prior unfair practice in a real estate transaction;</p>

Enforcement of the order and appeal therefrom by the complainant or respondent may be made as provided in RCW 49.60.260 and 49.60.270. If acts constituting the unfair practice in a real estate transaction that is the object of the charge are determined to have been committed by the same natural person who has been previously determined to have committed acts constituting an unfair practice in a real estate transaction, then the civil penalty of up to fifty thousand dollars may be imposed without regard to the period of time within which any subsequent unfair practice in a real estate transaction occurred.

<p>In case of failure to reach an agreement for the elimination of such unfair practice, and upon the entry of findings to that effect, the entire file, including the complaint and any and all findings made, shall be certified to the chairperson of the commission. The chairperson of the commission shall thereupon request the appointment of an administrative law judge under Title 34 RCW to hear the complaint and shall cause to be issued and served in the name of the commission a written notice, together with a copy of the complaint, as the same may have been amended, requiring the respondent to answer the charges of the complaint at a hearing before the administrative law judge, at a time and place to be specified in such notice.</p>

<p>The administrative law judge conducting any hearing may permit reasonable amendment to any complaint or answer. Testimony taken at the hearing shall be under oath and recorded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If, upon all the evidence, the administrative law judge finds that the respondent has engaged in any unfair practice, the administrative law judge shall state findings of fact and shall issue and file with the commission and cause to be served on such respondent an order requiring such respondent to cease and desist from such unfair practice and to take such affirmative action, including, (but not limited to) hiring, reinstatement or upgrading of employees, with or without back pay, an admission or restoration to full membership rights in any respondent organization, or to take such other action as, in the judgment of the administrative law judge, will effectuate the purposes of this chapter, including action that could be ordered by a court, except that damages for humiliation and mental suffering shall not exceed twenty thousand dollars, and including a requirement for report of the matter on compliance. Relief available for violations of RCW 49.60.222 through 49.60.224 shall be limited to the relief specified in RCW 49.60.225.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a determination is made that retaliatory action, as defined in RCW 42.40.050, has been taken against a whistleblower, as defined in RCW 42.40.020, the administrative law judge may, in addition to any other remedy, require restoration of benefits, back pay, and any increases in compensation that would have occurred, with interest; impose a civil penalty upon the retaliator of up to five thousand dollars; and issue an order to the state employer to suspend the retaliator for up to thirty days without pay. At a minimum, the administrative law judge shall require that a letter of reprimand be placed in the retaliator's personnel file. No agency shall issue any nondisclosure order or policy, execute any nondisclosure agreement, or spend any funds requiring information that is public under the public records act, chapter 42.56 RCW, be kept confidential; except that nothing in this section shall affect any state or federal law requiring information be kept confidential.

</li>
<li>
<p>If, upon all the evidence, the administrative law judge finds that the respondent has not engaged in any alleged unfair practice, the administrative law judge shall state findings of fact and shall similarly issue and file an order dismissing the complaint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An order dismissing a complaint may include an award of reasonable attorneys' fees in favor of the respondent if the administrative law judge concludes that the complaint was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall establish rules of practice to govern, expedite, and effectuate the foregoing procedure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of filing with the commission, a complainant may pursue arbitration conducted by the American arbitration association or another arbitrator mutually agreed by the parties, with the cost of arbitration shared equally by the complainant and the respondent.</p>

<li>
<p>It is an unfair practice under this chapter to subject an employee to an abusive work environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is an affirmative defense to an action for an abusive work environment that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct the abusive conduct and the aggrieved employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of appropriate preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer. The employer may demonstrate reasonable care by adopting employment policies prohibiting abusive conduct, providing educational materials on maintaining nonabusive work environments and establishing effective enforcement procedures. This defense is not available when the abusive conduct culminates in a negative employment decision; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The complaint is grounded primarily upon a negative employment decision made consistent with an employer's legitimate business interests, such as a termination or demotion based on an employee's poor performance, or the complaint is grounded primarily upon an employer's reasonable investigation of potentially illegal or unethical activity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Abusive conduct&quot; is repeated conduct of an employer or employee in the workplace, that a reasonable person would find hostile, offensive, and unrelated to an employer's legitimate business interests. In considering whether abusive conduct is present, a trier of fact should weigh the severity, nature, and frequency of the conduct. Abusive conduct may include, but is not limited to, infliction of verbal abuse such as the use of derogatory remarks, insults, and epithets; verbal or physical conduct that a reasonable person would find threatening, intimidating, humiliating, or isolating; or the gratuitous sabotage or undermining of a person's work performance or environment. A single act normally will not constitute abusive conduct, unless especially severe and egregious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Abusive work environment&quot; is a workplace where an employee is subjected to abusive conduct that is so severe that it causes physical, psychological, or economic harm to the employee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Constructive discharge&quot; is abusive conduct: (i) Which causes the employee to resign; (ii) where, prior to resigning, the employee brings to the employer's attention the existence of the abusive conduct; and (iii) which the employer fails to take reasonable steps to eliminate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Economic harm&quot; is the material impairment of a person's economic stability, including ones ability to earn income or secure employment opportunities, as documented by a competent physician, psychiatrist, psychotherapist, or psychologist, or supported by competent expert evidence at trial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Negative employment decision&quot; is a termination, constructive discharge, demotion, unfavorable reassignment, refusal to promote, or disciplinary action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Physical harm&quot; is the material impairment of a person's physical health or bodily integrity, as documented by a competent physician or supported by competent expert evidence at trial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Psychological harm&quot; is the material impairment of a person's mental health, as documented by a competent psychologist, psychiatrist, or psychotherapist, or supported by competent expert evidence at trial.</p>
