The duties devolving upon the city treasurer in those statutes are imposed on the treasurer of the authority;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To exercise all other powers necessary and appropriate to carry out its responsibilities, including without limitation the power to sue and be sued, to own, construct, purchase, lease, add to, and maintain any real and personal property or property rights necessary for the conduct of the affairs of the authority, to enter into contracts, and to employ the persons as the authority deems appropriate.

All insurance obtained for construction of authority projects with a total project cost exceeding $100,000,000 may be acquired by bid or by negotiation. In order to allow the authority flexibility to secure appropriate insurance by negotiation, the authority is exempt from RCW 48.30.270;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>To dispose of any real or personal property acquired in connection with any authority function and that is no longer required for the purposes of the authority, in the same manner as provided for cities of the first class.
