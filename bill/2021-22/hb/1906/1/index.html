<p>Washington state's property tax exemption framework for nonprofit organizations is unfair and unclear. Our state tax code provides an exemption to a limited scope of nonprofit organizations who are engaged in certain activities, and the scope of those activities are defined by convoluted regulations that are burdensome and costly for the public to understand. For example, the tax obligation of a charitable organization dedicated to raising funds and increasing opportunities for youth is made to depend not on its compliance with federal tax law for charities, but on whether it operates a &quot;public meeting hall&quot; that is used by the public more than it is used by the organization. Other nonprofit organizations that provide space for the community to enjoy farmers markets have seen uncertainty in our tax code from provisions that limit the number of days the farmers markets can operate. The legislature finds that charitable nonprofit organizations provide enormous benefit to Washington's communities and that Washington would be better suited by broader and clearer eligibility standards for property tax exempt status. The legislature recognizes that the less a nonprofit charitable organization pays in taxes and in compliance costs for determining state and local property tax obligations, the more our communities will benefit from their mission-driven efforts.</p>

<li>
<p>All churches, personal property, and the ground, not exceeding five acres in area, upon which a church of any nonprofit recognized religious denomination is or must be built, together with a parsonage, convent, and buildings and improvements required for the maintenance and safeguarding of such property. The area exempted must in any case include all ground covered by the church, parsonage, convent, and buildings and improvements required for the maintenance and safeguarding of such property and the structures and ground necessary for street access, parking, light, and ventilation, but the area of unoccupied ground exempted in such cases, in connection with church, parsonage, convent, and buildings and improvements required for the maintenance and safeguarding of such property, shall not exceed the equivalent of one hundred twenty by one hundred twenty feet except where additional unoccupied land may be required to conform with state or local codes, zoning, or licensing requirements. The parsonage and convent need not be on land contiguous to the church property. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, to be exempt the property must be wholly used for church purposes.</p>

<p>The loan or rental of property otherwise exempt under this subsection (2) to a nonprofit organization, association, or corporation, or school to conduct an eleemosynary activity <strong>or to conduct activities related to a farmers market. However, activities related to a farmers market may not occur on the property more than 53 days each assessment year. For the purposes of this section, &quot;farmers market&quot; has the same meaning as &quot;qualifying farmers market&quot; as defined in RCW 66.24.170</strong>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rental or use of the property by any individual, group, or entity, where such rental or use is not otherwise authorized by this subsection (2), for not more than fifty days in each calendar year, and the property is not used for pecuniary gain or to promote business activities for more than fifteen of the fifty days in each calendar year. The fifty and fifteen-day limitations provided in this subsection (2)(b)(ii) do not include days during which setup and takedown activities take place immediately preceding or following a meeting or other event by an individual, group, or entity using the property as provided in this subsection (2)(b)(ii); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An inadvertent use of the property in a manner inconsistent with the purpose for which exemption is granted, if the inadvertent use is not part of a pattern of use. A pattern of use is presumed when an inadvertent use is repeated in the same assessment year or in two or more successive assessment years.</p>
