# House Bill 1462

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/House%20Bills/1462.xml)
## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that in 2020, the legislature enacted Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill No. 5385, which requires regulated health carriers, public employee and school employee health plans, and medicaid managed care plans to reimburse a provider for health care services provided through telemedicine at the same rate as health care services provided in person, unless an exception is met. However, the legislature finds that since its enactment there has been some controversy as to the meaning of the term rate.

2. The legislature finds that the office of the insurance commissioner issued an interpretative statement on December 15, 2020, stating that beginning on January 1, 2021, the law requires health carriers to pay providers the same total compensation, also called "allowed amount", for telemedicine services as they would for in-person services, unless negotiation has been undertaken as allowed by the law.

3. Therefore, the legislature intends to codify the office of the insurance commissioner's interpretive statement and confirm that the intent of the law is to require health carriers to pay providers the same total compensation for telemedicine services as they would for in-person services unless negotiation has been undertaken as allowed by the law.


## Section 2
> This section modifies existing section [48.43.735](/rcw/48_insurance/48.043_insurance_reform.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/48_insurance/48.043_insurance_reform.md) for context.

1. [Empty]

    a. For health plans issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2017, a health carrier shall reimburse a provider for a health care service provided to a covered person through telemedicine or store and forward technology if:

        ii. The health care service is medically necessary;

        iii. The health care service is a service recognized as an essential health benefit under section 1302(b) of the federal patient protection and affordable care act in effect on January 1, 2015; and

    b. [Empty]

Except as provided in (b)(ii) of this subsection, for health plans issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2021, a health carrier shall reimburse a provider for a health care service provided to a covered person through telemedicine at the same **amount of total compensation as the health carrier would pay** if the health care service was provided in person by the provider.

        ii. Hospitals, hospital systems, telemedicine companies, and provider groups consisting of eleven or more providers may elect to negotiate a **total compensation amount** for telemedicine services that differs from the **total compensation amount** for in-person services.

        iii. For purposes of this subsection (1)(b), the number of providers in a provider group refers to all providers within the group, regardless of a provider's location.

2. For purposes of this section, reimbursement of store and forward technology is available only for those covered services specified in the negotiated agreement between the health carrier and the health care provider.

3. An originating site for a telemedicine health care service subject to subsection (1) of this section includes a:

A distant site or any other site not identified in subsection (3) of this section may not charge a facility fee.

5. A health carrier may not distinguish between originating sites that are rural and urban in providing the coverage required in subsection (1) of this section.

6. A health carrier may subject coverage of a telemedicine or store and forward technology health service under subsection (1) of this section to all terms and conditions of the plan in which the covered person is enrolled including, but not limited to, utilization review, prior authorization, deductible, copayment, or coinsurance requirements that are applicable to coverage of a comparable health care service provided in person.

7. This section does not require a health carrier to reimburse:

    a. An originating site for professional fees;

    b. A provider for a health care service that is not a covered benefit under the plan; or

    c. An originating site or health care provider when the site or provider is not a contracted provider under the plan.

    g. "Telemedicine" means the delivery of health care services through the use of interactive audio and video technology, permitting real-time communication between the patient at the originating site and the provider, for the purpose of diagnosis, consultation, or treatment. For purposes of this section only, "telemedicine" does not include the use of audio-only telephone, facsimile, or email.

9. **The commissioner may adopt rules necessary to implement this section.**
