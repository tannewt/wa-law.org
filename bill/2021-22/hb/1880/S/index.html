<h2 id="section-1-3192">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-3192">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Housing for low-income and moderate-income households is a public purpose;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing local governments with more options to increase residential capacity, especially in urban areas, consistent with RCW 43.21C.420, is essential to fulfill this public purpose;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A history of segregation and displacement has led to disparities in access to education, living wage employment, affordable housing, and transportation, particularly for black, indigenous, and people of color communities. This history has also allowed certain populations to obtain and build wealth and to access critical resources at the expense of others. Over time these factors have put pressure on, marginalized, and displaced many from these same communities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Black, Hispanic, and American Indian and Alaska Native residents in the King, Pierce, and Snohomish county region experience disproportionate housing cost burden and are more likely to be renters than homeowners. According to 2018 data from the federal housing and urban development department, the rates of homeownership for black residents were half the rate for white residents of the region. Black renters are also 30 percent more likely to be cost-burdened than white renters, and black homeowners are 38 percent more likely to be cost-burdened than white homeowners. Similar disparities exist for Hispanic populations whose rates of homeownership are 58 percent of the rate of white homeownership, are 17 percent more likely to be rental cost-burdened than white renters, and 25 percent more likely to be owner cost-burdened than white homeowners. American Indian and Alaska Native populations have rates of homeownership that are 71 percent that of white residents, are 12 percent more likely to be rental cost-burdened than white renters, and eight percent more likely to be owner cost-burdened than white homeowners;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the fair housing equity assessment for the central Puget Sound region published by the Puget Sound regional council in 2014:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Black residents continue to be the most segregated racial group in the region, which data suggests cannot be explained by income differences among racial groups; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>White and Asian residents are more likely to live in census tracts with high or very high access to opportunity relative to the total population when compared to foreign-born, American Indian, Hispanic, and black residents who are more likely to live in census tracts with low or very low access to opportunity relative to the total population. Living in poverty is associated with a higher likelihood of living in an area of low or very low access to opportunity, but this cannot explain why black and Hispanic persons living in poverty are more likely to live in areas of low or very low access to opportunity than their white or Asian peers;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Publicly funded salaried professionals and paraprofessionals such as teachers, firefighters, law enforcement officers, nurses, social workers, and transit operators cannot afford to live in the districts in which they serve due to increasing housing costs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Employees of nonprofit organizations who help deliver essential public services on contract, as well as those who help provide essential services to the poor and infirm as part of their organizational mission, are similarly housing cost-constrained;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The failure to make adequate provision for low-income and moderate-income housing pushes many households to seek housing further away from work, which leads to increased greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, as well as congestion on state managed transportation infrastructure, so providing for more low-income and moderate-income housing would enable the state to better meet established goals for greenhouse gas emissions reduction and commute trip reduction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better public policy outcomes, including improvements and benefits to transportation infrastructure and business, will occur if public servants and nonprofit employees can afford to live in the districts they serve;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communities across the state are facing an affordable housing crisis and there is a particularly acute need for affordable housing in the Puget Sound region. With historic investments in transit in the Puget Sound region, communities have the unprecedented and urgent opportunity to plan for, invest in, and build additional affordable housing, ensuring the region gets the most out of these investments in transit while meeting critical economic, environmental, and equity goals; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Housing can drive economic growth within neighborhoods if developed with a focus on services, jobs, infrastructure improvements, open spaces, equity, and other elements that make housing vital and economically additive to nearby residents and the region as a whole.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends with this act to establish a housing benefit district pilot program which, using a land acquisition and deployment strategy, would produce more affordable low-income and moderate-income housing, ensuring any loss of affordable housing in a station area is exceeded by new affordable units, to enable all members of the workforce to live in the district in which they serve, including members of racial and ethnic groups disproportionately experiencing adverse housing outcomes, to make sure that the transportation and housing investments in our state help to foster racial equity and rectify discriminatory practices.</p>
</li>

<p>A housing benefit district shall by covenant, deed restriction, and contract ensure that the properties which it transfers or arranges to develop for housing purposes meet or exceed the minimum affordable housing mixture requirements of section 3(4) of this act; and, that the overall mixture of housing developed shall result in a net gain in extremely low-income, very low-income, and low-income housing from the levels existing at the time of formation of the district. Once a housing benefit district is established and housing has been developed and opened for residency, participating cities must conduct regular audits of those housing units built to date on properties of which the district has either transferred ownership for housing purposes or retained ownership and developed for housing to ensure that the district and current owners or operators of such housing units are achieving the affordable housing mix as required by section 3(4) of this act. Audits shall be performed every three years, and at least one-third of all units must be audited during each three-year cycle, with the entire number of units audited after three audit cycles. The audit should determine whether there is a net gain of affordable housing within each quartile below median income within the station area. Audits shall be conducted at the expense of the housing benefit district. If any owner or manager of housing units is determined by the audits required by this section to not be offering units deemed affordable to the residents pursuant to the mixture of affordability established by the district, the auditing city shall provide notice to the district and establish a plan to bring the owner or manager into compliance for minor or inadvertent variation from the plan. For significant variances from the affordable housing plan and commitments, the city shall notify the department of revenue and the state, county, and city shall require repayment of any tax preference provided on the basis of the owner providing affordable housing for all years during which the owner was not substantially in compliance; and may issue penalties up to the difference between the market rate at which units were offered and the affordable housing rental rate which would have been charged if the owner or manager was compliant with the plan. Penalties collected by the city shall be used solely for purposes associated with providing affordable housing and related services as defined in section 6 of this act.</p>

The rate of tax for a participating city may not exceed 0.025 percent of the selling price in the case of a sales tax or value of the article used in the case of a use tax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tax imposed under subsection (1) of this section must be deducted from the amount of tax otherwise required to be collected or paid over to the department under chapter 82.08 or 82.12 RCW. The department must perform the collection of such taxes on behalf of the participating city at no cost to the participating city.</p>

<li>
<p>To carry out the purposes of this act and notwithstanding RCW 39.36.020(1), a district may issue general obligation bonds without voter approval, not to exceed an amount, together with any other outstanding nonvoter-approved general obligation indebtedness of the district, equal to one and one-half percent of the value of taxable property within the district, as the term &quot;value of the taxable property&quot; is defined in RCW 39.36.015. General obligation bonds shall be issued in accordance with chapter 39.46 RCW. Whenever general obligation bonds are issued to fund specific projects or enterprises that generate revenues, the district may specifically pledge all or a portion of the revenues to pay the principal of and interest on the general obligation bonds. The district may also pledge any other revenues that may be available to the district.</p>

<li>
<p>Land acquisition, based on equitable station area plans and working with local jurisdictions and both nonprofit and for-profit developers and community land trusts to acquire, assemble, lease, land bank parcels, or sell, in cases where the station area plan clearly demonstrates that it is not financially feasible to lease all development parcels, with the net proceeds directed to subsidies for affordable housing and permanently affordable homeownership and to promote community land trusts and infrastructure costs. Where leasing a development parcel is financially feasible, the housing benefit district may also choose to retain the underlying ownership of the parcel. The housing benefit district shall include in station area plans specific enforceable commitments to include in deed restrictions, covenants, contracts, and leases which ensure that the plan does not reduce the housing units available in the station area for extremely low, very low, and low-income residents; and which establish a plan to meet the affordable housing population requirements in section 3(4) of this act, including minimum expectations for owners and managers of all properties which it has purchased.
