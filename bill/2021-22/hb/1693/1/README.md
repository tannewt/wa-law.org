## Section 1
The legislature finds that home schooling serves as an excellent option for both parents and students allowing for uniquely tailored education, superior educational outcomes, and a pathway to opportunity for our future generations especially for Washingtonians from historically marginalized communities.

The legislature intends to establish home school day to celebrate and raise awareness around the educational, social, and family benefits that home schooling has provided for hundreds of thousands of Washingtonians.

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic and much educational uncertainty for Washington students, tens of thousands of Washington families chose to temporarily or permanently use home schooling in order to ensure their children's safety and provide them with high quality education.

Washingtonians from all backgrounds have been well-served through home schooling options. It is therefore the intent of the legislature to recognize and celebrate home schooling by designating the first day of May as home school day.

2. Employees of the state and its political subdivisions, except employees of school districts and except those nonclassified employees of institutions of higher education who hold appointments or are employed under contracts to perform services for periods of less than twelve consecutive months, are entitled to one paid holiday per calendar year in addition to those specified in this section. Each employee of the state or its political subdivisions may select the day on which the employee desires to take the additional holiday provided for in this section after consultation with the employer pursuant to guidelines to be promulgated by rule of the appropriate personnel authority, or in the case of local government by ordinance or resolution of the legislative authority.

3. Employees of the state and its political subdivisions, including employees of school districts and those nonclassified employees of institutions of higher education who hold appointments or are employed under contracts to perform services for periods of less than twelve consecutive months, are entitled to two unpaid holidays per calendar year for a reason of faith or conscience or an organized activity conducted under the auspices of a religious denomination, church, or religious organization. This includes employees of public institutions of higher education, including community colleges, technical colleges, and workforce training programs. The employee may select the days on which the employee desires to take the two unpaid holidays after consultation with the employer pursuant to guidelines to be promulgated by rule of the appropriate personnel authority, or in the case of local government by ordinance or resolution of the legislative authority. If an employee prefers to take the two unpaid holidays on specific days for a reason of faith or conscience, or an organized activity conducted under the auspices of a religious denomination, church, or religious organization, the employer must allow the employee to do so unless the employee's absence would impose an undue hardship on the employer or the employee is necessary to maintain public safety. Undue hardship shall have the meaning established in rule by the office of financial management under RCW 43.41.109.

4. If any of the state legal holidays specified in this section are also federal legal holidays but observed on different dates, only the state legal holidays are recognized as a paid legal holiday for employees of the state and its political subdivisions. However, for port districts and the law enforcement and public transit employees of municipal corporations, either the federal or the state legal holiday is recognized as a paid legal holiday, but in no case may both holidays be recognized as a paid legal holiday for employees.

5. Whenever any state legal holiday:

    a. Other than Sunday, falls upon a Sunday, the following Monday is the legal holiday; or

    b. Falls upon a Saturday, the preceding Friday is the legal holiday.
