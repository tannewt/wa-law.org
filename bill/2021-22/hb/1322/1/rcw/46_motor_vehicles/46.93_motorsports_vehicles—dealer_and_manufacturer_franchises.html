<p>The legislature finds and declares that the distribution and sale of motorsports vehicles in this state vitally affect the general economy of the state and the public interest and public welfare, that provision for warranty service to motorsports vehicles is of substantial concern to the people of this state, that the maintenance of fair competition among dealers and others is in the public interest, and that the maintenance of strong and sound dealerships is essential to provide continuing and necessary reliable services to the consuming public in this state and to provide stable employment to the citizens of this state. The legislature further finds that there is a substantial disparity in bargaining power between motorsports vehicle manufacturers and their dealers, and that in order to promote the public interest and the public welfare, and in the exercise of its police power, it is necessary to regulate the relationship between motorsports vehicle dealers and motorsports vehicle manufacturers, importers, distributors, and their representatives doing business in this state, not only for the protection of dealers but also for the benefit for the public in assuring the continued availability and servicing of motorsports vehicles sold to the public.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes it is in the best interest for manufacturers and dealers of motorsports vehicles to conduct business with each other in a fair, efficient, and competitive manner. The legislature declares the public interest is best served by dealers being assured of the ability to manage their business enterprises under a contractual obligation with manufacturers where dealers do not experience unreasonable interference and are assured of the ability to transfer ownership of their business without undue constraints. It is the intent of the legislature to impose a regulatory scheme and to regulate competition in the motorsports vehicle industry to the extent necessary to balance fairness and efficiency. These actions will permit motorsports vehicle dealers to better serve consumers and allow dealers to devote their best competitive efforts and resources to the sale and services of the manufacturer's products to consumers.</p>

<p>A new motorsports vehicle dealer who has received written notification from the manufacturer of the manufacturer's intent to terminate, cancel, or not renew the franchise, may file a petition with the department for a determination as to the existence of good cause and good faith for the termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal of a franchise.

Upon the filing of the petition and the receipt of the filing fee, the department shall promptly notify the manufacturer that a timely petition has been filed and shall request the appointment of an administrative law judge under chapter 34.12 RCW to conduct a hearing. The franchise in question continues in full force and effect pending the administrative law judge's decision. If the decision of the administrative law judge terminating, canceling, or failing to renew a dealer's franchise is appealed by a dealer or manufacturer, the franchise continues in full force and effect until all appeals to a superior court or any appellate court have been completed. Nothing in this section precludes a manufacturer or dealer from petitioning the superior court for a stay or other relief pending judicial review.</p>

Each manufacturer shall provide each of its dealers with a schedule of compensation to be paid to the dealer for any warranty work or service, including parts, labor, and diagnostic work, required of the dealer by the manufacturer in connection with the manufacturer's products, and for work on and preparation of motorsports vehicles received from the manufacturer. The compensation may not be less than the rates reasonably charged by the dealer for like services and parts to retail customers. The compensation may not be reduced by the manufacturer for any reason or made conditional on an activity outside the performance of warranty work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All claims for warranty work for parts and labor made by dealers under this section must be paid by the manufacturer within thirty days after approval, and must be approved or denied within thirty days of receipt by the manufacturer. Denial of a claim must be in writing with the specific grounds for denial. The manufacturer may audit claims for warranty work and charge the dealer for any unsubstantiated, incorrect, or false claims for a period of one year after payment. However, the manufacturer may audit and charge the dealer for any fraudulent claims during any period for which an action for fraud may be commenced under applicable state law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All claims submitted by dealers on the forms and in the manner specified by the manufacturer must be either approved or disapproved within thirty days after their receipt. The manufacturer shall notify the dealer in writing of a disapproved claim, and shall set forth the reasons why the claim was not approved. A claim not specifically disapproved in writing within thirty days after receipt is approved, and the manufacturer is required to pay that claim within thirty days of receipt of the claim.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the terms of a franchise, an owner may appoint a designated successor to succeed to the ownership of the dealer franchise upon the owner's death or incapacity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding the terms of a franchise, a designated successor of a deceased or incapacitated owner of a dealer franchise may succeed to the ownership interest of the owner under the existing franchise, if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>In the case of a designated successor who meets the definition of a designated successor under *RCW 46.93.020(5), but who is not experienced in the business of a new motorsports vehicle dealer, the person will employ an individual who is qualified and experienced in the business of a new motorsports vehicle dealer to help manage the day-to-day operations of the dealership; or in the case of a designated successor who meets the definition of a designated successor under *RCW 46.93.020(5) (b) or (c), the person is qualified and experienced in the business of a new motorsports vehicle dealer and meets the normal, reasonable, and uniformly applied standards for grant of an application as a dealer by the manufacturer; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The designated successor furnishes written notice to the manufacturer of his or her intention to succeed to the ownership of the dealership within sixty days after the owner's death or incapacity; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The designated successor agrees to be bound by all terms and conditions of the franchise.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The manufacturer may request, and the designated successor shall promptly provide, such personal and financial information as is reasonably necessary to determine whether the succession should be honored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A manufacturer may refuse to honor the succession to the ownership of a dealer franchise by a designated successor if the manufacturer establishes that good cause exists for its refusal to honor the succession. If the designated successor of a deceased or incapacitated owner of a dealer franchise fails to meet the requirements set forth in subsection (2)(a), (b), and (c) of this section, good cause for refusing to honor the succession is presumed to exist. If a manufacturer believes that good cause exists for refusing to honor the succession to the ownership of a dealer franchise by a designated successor, the manufacturer shall serve written notice on the designated successor and on the department of its refusal to honor the succession no earlier than sixty days from the date the notice is served. The notice must be served not later than sixty days after the manufacturer's receipt of:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Notice of the designated successor's intent to succeed to the ownership interest of the dealer's franchise; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any personal or financial information requested by the manufacturer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The notice in subsection (4) of this section must state the specific grounds for the refusal to honor the succession. If the notice of refusal is not timely and properly served, the designated successor may continue the franchise in full force and effect, subject to termination only as otherwise provided under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within twenty days after receipt of the notice, or within twenty days after the end of any appeal procedure provided by the manufacturer, whichever is greater, the designated successor may file a petition with the department protesting the refusal to honor the succession. The petition must contain a short statement setting forth the reasons for the designated successor's protest. Upon the filing of a protest and the receipt of the filing fee, the department shall promptly notify the manufacturer that a timely protest has been filed and shall request the appointment of an administrative law judge under chapter 34.12 RCW to conduct a hearing. The manufacturer may not terminate or otherwise discontinue the existing franchise until the administrative law judge has held a hearing and has determined that there is good cause for refusing to honor the succession. If an appeal is taken, the manufacturer may not terminate or discontinue the franchise until all appeals to a superior court or any appellate court have been completed. Nothing in this section precludes a manufacturer or dealer from petitioning the superior court for a stay or other relief pending judicial review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The manufacturer has the burden of proof to show that good cause exists for the refusal to honor the succession.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The administrative law judge shall conduct the hearing and render a final decision as expeditiously as possible, but in any event not later than one hundred eighty days after a protest is filed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The administrative law judge shall conduct a hearing concerning the refusal to the succession as provided in RCW 46.93.050(2), and all hearing costs must be borne as provided in that subsection. A party to such a hearing aggrieved by the final order of the administrative law judge may appeal as provided and allowed in RCW 46.93.050(3).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not preclude the owner of a dealer franchise from designating any person as his or her successor by a written, notarized, and witnessed instrument filed with the manufacturer. In the event of a conflict between this section and such a written instrument that has not been revoked by written notice from the owner to the manufacturer, the written instrument governs.</p>

The notice must be sent by certified mail to each such party and include the following information:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Within thirty days after receipt of the notice under RCW 46.93.120, or within thirty days after the end of an appeal procedure provided by the manufacturer, whichever is greater, a dealer notified or entitled to notice may file a petition with the department protesting the proposed establishment or relocation. The petition must contain a short statement setting forth the reasons for the dealer's objection to the proposed establishment or relocation. Upon the filing of a protest and the receipt of the filing fee, the department shall promptly notify the manufacturer that a timely protest has been filed and shall request the appointment of an administrative law judge under chapter 34.12 RCW to conduct a hearing. The manufacturer may not establish or relocate the dealer until the administrative law judge has held a hearing and administrative proceeding under the Administrative Procedure Act, chapter 34.05 RCW, and has determined that there is good cause for permitting the proposed establishment or relocation. When more than one protest is filed against the establishment or relocation of the same dealer, the administrative law judge shall consolidate the hearings to expedite disposition of the matter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a manufacturer provides in the franchise agreement or by written statement distributed and provided to its dealers for arbitration under the Washington Arbitration Act, *chapter 7.04 RCW, as a mechanism for resolving disputes relating to the establishment of an additional new motorsports vehicle dealer or the relocation of a new motorsports vehicle dealer, subsection (1) of this section and RCW 46.93.140 will take precedence and the arbitration provision in the franchise agreement or a written statement is void, unless the manufacturer and dealer agree to use arbitration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the manufacturer and dealer agree to use arbitration, the dispute must be referred for arbitration to such arbitrator as may be agreed upon by the parties to the dispute. The thirty-day period for filing a protest under subsection (1) of this section still applies except the protesting dealer shall file the protest with the manufacturer. If the parties cannot agree upon a single arbitrator within thirty days from the date the protest is filed, the protesting dealer will select an arbitrator, the manufacturer will select an arbitrator, and the two arbitrators will then select a third arbitrator. If a third arbitrator is not agreed upon within thirty days, any party may apply to the superior court, and the judge of the superior court having jurisdiction will appoint the third arbitrator. The protesting dealer will pay the arbitrator selected by him or her, and the manufacturer will pay the arbitrator it selected. The expense of the third arbitrator and all other expenses of arbitration will be shared equally by the parties. Attorneys' fees and fees paid to expert witnesses are not expenses of arbitration and will be paid by the person incurring them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding the terms of a franchise or written statement of the manufacturer and notwithstanding the terms of a waiver, the arbitration will take place in this state in the county where the protesting dealer has its principal place of business. RCW 46.93.140 applies to a determination made by the arbitrator or arbitrators in determining whether good cause exists for permitting the proposed establishment or relocation of a dealer, and the manufacturer has the burden of proof to establish that good cause exists for permitting the proposed establishment or relocation. After a hearing has been held, the arbitrator or arbitrators shall render a decision as expeditiously as possible, but in any event not later than one hundred twenty days from the date the arbitrator or arbitrators are selected or appointed. The manufacturer may not establish or relocate the new motorsports vehicle dealer until the arbitration hearing has been held and the arbitrator or arbitrators have determined that there is good cause for permitting the proposed establishment or relocation and any judicial appeals under *chapter 7.04 RCW have been completed. The written decision of the arbitrator is binding upon the parties unless modified, corrected, or vacated under the Washington Arbitration Act. Any party may appeal the decision of the arbitrator or arbitrators under the Washington Arbitration Act, *chapter 7.04 RCW.</p>

<li>
<p>Notwithstanding the terms of a franchise, a manufacturer may not unreasonably withhold consent to the sale, transfer, or exchange of a franchise to a qualified buyer who meets the normal, reasonable, and uniformly applied standards established by the manufacturer for the appointment of a dealer or is capable of being approved by the department as a dealer in this state. A manufacturer's failure to respond in writing to a request for consent under this subsection within sixty days after receipt of a written request on the forms, if any, generally used by the manufacturer containing the information and reasonable promises required by a manufacturer, is deemed to be consent to the request. A manufacturer may request, and, if so requested, the applicant for a franchise (a) shall promptly provide such personal and financial information as is reasonably necessary to determine whether the sale, transfer, or exchange should be approved, and (b) shall agree to be bound by all reasonable terms and conditions of the franchise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a manufacturer refuses to approve the sale, transfer, or exchange of a franchise, the manufacturer shall serve written notice on the applicant, the transferring, selling, or exchanging dealer, and the department, of its refusal to approve the transfer of the franchise no later than sixty days after the date the manufacturer receives the written request from the dealer. If the manufacturer has requested personal or financial information from the applicant under subsection (1) of this section, the notice must be served not later than sixty days after the receipt of all of such documents. Service of all notices under this section must be made by personal service or by certified mail, return receipt requested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The notice in subsection (2) of this section must state the specific grounds for the refusal to approve the sale, transfer, or exchange of the franchise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within twenty days after receipt of the notice of refusal to approve the sale, transfer, or exchange of the franchise by the transferring dealer, the dealer may file a petition with the department to protest the refusal to approve the sale, transfer, or exchange. The petition must contain a short statement setting forth the reasons for the dealer's protest. Upon the filing of a protest and the receipt of the filing fee, the department shall promptly notify the manufacturer that a timely protest has been filed, and the department shall arrange for a hearing with an administrative law judge as the presiding officer to determine if the manufacturer unreasonably withheld consent to the sale, transfer, or exchange of the franchise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining whether the manufacturer unreasonably withheld its approval to the sale, transfer, or exchange, the manufacturer has the burden of proof that it acted reasonably. A manufacturer's refusal to accept or approve a proposed buyer who otherwise meets the normal, reasonable, and uniformly applied standards established by the manufacturer for the appointment of a new dealer, or who otherwise is capable of operating as a dealer in this state, is presumed to be unreasonable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The administrative law judge shall conduct a hearing and render a final decision as expeditiously as possible, but in any event not later than one hundred twenty days after a protest is filed. Only the selling, transferring, or exchanging dealer and the manufacturer may be parties to the hearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The administrative law judge shall conduct any hearing as provided in RCW 46.93.050(2), and all hearing costs must be borne as provided in that subsection. Only the manufacturer and the selling, transferring, or exchanging dealer may appeal the final order of the administrative law judge to the superior court or the appellate court as provided in the Administrative Procedure Act, chapter 34.05 RCW.</p>

<p>The department shall determine and establish the amount of the filing fees required in RCW 46.93.040, 46.93.110, 46.93.130, and 46.93.180. The fees must be set in accordance with RCW 43.24.086.</p>
<p>The department may also require the petitioning or protesting party to give security, in such sum as the department deems proper but not to exceed one thousand dollars, for the payment of such costs as may be incurred in conducting the hearing as required under this chapter. The security may be given in the form of a bond or stipulation or other undertaking with one or more sureties.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the hearing, the department shall assess, in equal shares, each of the parties to the hearing for the cost of conducting the hearing. Upon receipt of payment of the costs, the department shall refund and return to the petitioning party any excess funds initially posted by the party as security for the hearing costs. If the petitioning party provided security in the form of a bond or other undertaking with one or more sureties, the bond or other undertaking will then be exonerated and the surety or sureties under it discharged.</p>

<li>
<p>By the first business day in February of each year, beginning in 2018, motorsports vehicle manufacturers must report to the department of licensing a listing of all motorsports vehicle warranties for off-road vehicles under chapter 46.09 RCW and snowmobiles under chapter 46.10 RCW sold to Washington residents by out-of-state motorsports vehicle dealers in the previous calendar year. The report must be transmitted such that the department receives the listing no later than the first business day in February. Failure to report a complete listing as required under this subsection results in an administrative fine of one hundred dollars for each day after the first business day in February that the department has not received the report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of licensing shall examine the listing reported in subsection (1) of this section to verify whether the vehicles are properly registered in the state <strong>and shall transmit the results of its analysis to the department of revenue</strong>. Beginning in 2018, and to the extent that it has received the listing required under subsection (1) of this section, the department <strong>and the department of revenue</strong> shall <strong>jointly</strong> notify by certified mail from the United States postal service, with return receipt requested, by the end of February of each year, the purchasers of the warranties of the off-road vehicles and snowmobiles that are not properly registered in the state of the owner's obligations under state law regarding vehicle titling, registration, and use tax payment, as well as of the penalties for failure to comply with the law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fines received under this section must be paid into the state treasury and credited to the nonhighway and off-road vehicle activities program account under RCW 46.09.510 and to the snowmobile account under RCW 46.68.350. The state treasurer must apportion the fines between the accounts according to the pro rata share of the number of off-road vehicle and snowmobile registrations in the previous calendar year.
