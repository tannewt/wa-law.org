<blockquote>
<p>This section adds a new section to an existing chapter <a href="/rcw/84_property_taxes/84.36_exemptions.html">84.36</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/84_property_taxes/84.36_exemptions.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Beginning with taxes levied for collection in calendar year 2023, real property is exempt from ad valorem taxation levied for a given year if that property was used as a host home for at least 90 days in that year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A claim for exemption under subsection (1) of this section may be made and filed by the owner of the host home at any time during the year for exemption from taxes payable the following year upon forms as prescribed by the department. The forms must require a person to provide sufficient evidence to support their eligibility to receive the exemption and the form may require a person to provide verification from the host home program that the real property was used as a host home as required in subsection (1) of this section. The claim for exemption must be submitted to the county assessor no later than December 31st of each year for exemption from taxes payable the following year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The county assessor must evaluate each claim for exemption to determine a person's eligibility for the exemption. If the county assessor finds that a person meets the qualifications established in subsection (1) of this section, the claim for exemption must be approved. If the county assessor finds that a person does not meet the qualifications established in subsection (1) of this section, the claim for exemption must be denied, but the denial is subject to appeal under the provisions of RCW 84.48.010 and 84.40.038. The county assessor must notify the applicant of either determination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A claim for exemption approved under (a) of this subsection (3) is valid for one year and provides for the exemption from taxes payable in the year following the year in which the claim was due. A person must file a new claim as provided in subsection (2) of this section for each year for which that person is eligible for the exemption.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county assessor must accept any late claim for exemption made within three years after the due date of payment of taxes for which an exemption is sought. If the county assessor approves such a claim, the application constitutes a claim for refund under chapter 84.69 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section, &quot;host home&quot; and &quot;host home program&quot; have the same meaning as in RCW 74.15.020.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>No refunds under the provisions of this section shall be made because of any error in determining the valuation of property, except as authorized in subsections (9), (10), (11), and (12) of this section nor may any refunds be made if a bona fide purchaser has acquired rights that would preclude the assessment and collection of the refunded tax from the property that should properly have been charged with the tax. Any refunds made on delinquent taxes must include the proportionate amount of interest and penalties paid. However, no refunds as a result of an incorrect payment authorized under subsection (8) of this section made by a third party payee shall be granted. The county treasurer may deduct from moneys collected for the benefit of the state's levies, refunds of the state's levies including interest on the levies as provided by this section and chapter 84.68 RCW.</p>
<p>The county treasurer of each county must make all refunds determined to be authorized by this section, and by the first Monday in February of each year, report to the county legislative authority a list of all refunds made under this section during the previous year. The list is to include the name of the person receiving the refund, the amount of the refund, and the reason for the refund.</p>
