<li>
<p>The legislature finds that public buildings can be built and renovated using high-performance methods that save money, improve school performance, and make workers more productive. High-performance public buildings are proven to increase student test scores, reduce worker absenteeism, and cut energy and utility costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that state-owned buildings and schools be improved by adopting recognized standards for high-performance public buildings, reducing energy consumption, and allowing flexible methods and choices in how to achieve those standards and reductions. The legislature also intends that public agencies and public school districts shall document costs and savings to monitor this program and ensure that economic, community, and environmental goals are achieved each year, and that an independent performance review be conducted to evaluate this program and determine the extent to which the results intended by this chapter are being met.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that state agency leadership is needed in the development of preparation and adaptation actions for climate change to ensure the economic health, safety, and environmental well-being of the state and its citizens.</p>
