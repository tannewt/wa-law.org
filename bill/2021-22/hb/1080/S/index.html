</li>
<li>
<p>The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this act unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Fiscal year 2022&quot; or &quot;FY 2022&quot; means the period beginning July 1, 2021, and ending June 30, 2022.</p>

<li>
<p>&quot;Fiscal year 2023&quot; or &quot;FY 2023&quot; means the period beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2023.</p>

<li>
<p>&quot;Lapse&quot; or &quot;revert&quot; means the amount shall return to an unappropriated status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Provided solely&quot; means the specified amount may be spent only for the specified purpose.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise specifically authorized in this act, any portion of an amount provided solely for a specified purpose that is not expended subject to the specified conditions and limitations to fulfill the specified purpose shall lapse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amounts shown under the headings &quot;Prior Biennia,&quot; &quot;Future Biennia,&quot; and &quot;Total&quot; in this act are for informational purposes only and do not constitute legislative approval of these amounts. &quot;Prior biennia&quot; typically refers to the immediate prior biennium for reappropriations, but may refer to multiple biennia in the case of specific projects. A &quot;future biennia&quot; amount is an estimate of what may be appropriated for the project or program in the 2023-2025 biennium and the following three biennia; an amount of zero does not necessarily constitute legislative intent to not provide funding for the project or program in the future.</p>

<p>The appropriation in this section is subject to the following conditions and limitations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The appropriation is provided solely for the department to establish and administer a pilot program to provide grants for implementing water banking strategies to meet local water needs. The grants may only be used for:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Acquisition of water rights appropriate for use in a water bank, including all costs necessary to evaluate the water right for eligibility for its intended use;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Activities necessary to facilitate the creation of a water bank;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Development of a water bank that is intended to provide a local public benefit. A local public benefit means a beneficial use of water, under chapters 90.03 and 90.54 RCW and WAC 173-500-050, that provides economic benefit to the county of origin, preserves water rights for use in the county of origin, and provides instream flow benefits. &quot;County of origin&quot;, as used in this subsection (1)(c), means the county in which the waters that form the basis of the water rights held by the water bank originate; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Development of water banks in rural counties, as defined in RCW 82.14.370, that also have the headwaters of a major watershed within their borders. A major watershed has the same meaning as shoreline of statewide significance in RCW 90.58.030 (2)(f)(v)(A) and (B).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Water banking strategies developed under this section must be limited to the county of origin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>When prioritizing grants under this section, the department must consider:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Whether the grant recipient has sufficient expertise and capacity to develop and maintain a water bank consistent with the purposes of this appropriation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the grant recipient has secured a valid interest to purchase a water right;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the water right appears to be adequate for the intended use; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The extent to which the applicant leverages other public or private funding.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the criteria in (a) of this subsection (3), the department shall give preference to public entities and to public-private partnerships.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The legislature finds that use of life-cycle cost analysis will aid public entities, architects, engineers, and contractors in making design and construction decisions that positively impact both the initial construction cost and the ongoing operating and maintenance cost of a project. To ensure that the total cost of a project is accounted for and the most reasonable and cost efficient design is used, agencies shall develop life-cycle costs for any construction project over $10,000,000. The life-cycle costs must represent the present value sum of capital costs, installation costs, operating costs, and maintenance costs over the life expectancy of the project. The legislature further finds the most effective approach to the life-cycle cost analysis is to integrate it into the early part of the design process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agencies must develop a minimum of three project alternatives for use in the life-cycle cost analysis.

<p>Any building project that receives over $10,000,000 in funding from the capital budget must be built to sustainable standards. &quot;Sustainable building&quot; means a building that integrates and optimizes all major high-performance building attributes, including energy efficiency, durability, life-cycle performance, and occupant productivity, and minimizes greenhouse gas emissions. The following design and construction attributes must be integrated into the building project:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Employ integrated design principles: Use a collaborative, integrated planning and design process that initiates and maintains an integrated project team in all stages of a project's planning and delivery. Establish performance goals for siting, energy, water, materials, and indoor environmental quality along with other comprehensive design goals and ensures incorporation of these goals throughout the design and life-cycle of the building. Consider all stages of the building's life-cycle, including deconstruction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commissioning: Employ commissioning practices tailored to the size and complexity of the building and its system components in order to verify performance of building components and systems and help ensure that design requirements are met. This should include an experienced commissioning provider, inclusion of commissioning requirements in construction documents, a commissioning plan, verification of the installation and performance of systems to be commissioned, and a commissioning report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimize energy performance: Establish a whole building performance target that takes into account the intended use, occupancy, operations, plug loads, other energy demands, and design to earn the ENERGY STAR targets for new construction and major renovation where applicable. For new construction target low energy use index. For major renovations, target reducing energy use by 50 percent below prerenovations baseline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On-site renewable energy: Implement renewable energy generation projects on agency property for agency use, when life-cycle cost effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High-efficiency electric equipment: Use only high-efficiency electric equipment for water and space heating needs not met through on-site renewable energy, when life-cycle cost effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Measurement and verification: For buildings over 50,000 square feet, install building level electricity meters in new major construction and renovation projects to track and continuously optimize performance. Include equivalent meters for natural gas and steam, where natural gas and steam are used. Where appropriate, install dashboards inside buildings to display and incentivize occupants on energy use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Benchmarking: Compare performance data from the first year of operation with the energy design target. Verify that the building performance meets or exceeds the design target. For other building and space types, use an equivalent benchmarking tool.</p>
