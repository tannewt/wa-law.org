</li>
<li>
<p>After July 23, 1989, a party who obtains a judgment or order of a court or an administrative order entered as defined in RCW 74.20A.020(6) for accrued child support, or the assignee or the current holder thereof, may have an execution, garnishment, or other legal process issued upon that judgment or order at any time within <strong>10</strong> years of the <strong>18th</strong> birthday of the youngest child named in the order for whom support is ordered.</p>

<li>
<p>After June 9, 1994, a party in whose favor a judgment has been filed as a foreign judgment or rendered pursuant to subsection (1) or (4) of this section, or the assignee or the current holder thereof, may, within <strong>90</strong> days before the expiration of the original <strong>10-year</strong> period, apply to the court that rendered the judgment or to the court where the judgment was filed as a foreign judgment for an order granting an additional <strong>10</strong> years during which an execution, garnishment, or other legal process may be issued. If a district court judgment of this state is transcribed to a superior court of this state, the original district court judgment shall not be extended and any petition under this section to extend the judgment that has been transcribed to superior court shall be filed in the superior court within <strong>90</strong> days before the expiration of the <strong>10-year</strong> period of the date the transcript of the district court judgment was filed in the superior court of this state. The petitioner shall pay to the court a filing fee equal to the filing fee for filing the first or initial paper in a civil action in the court, except in the case of district court judgments transcribed to superior court, where the filing fee shall be the fee for filing the first or initial paper in a civil action in the superior court where the judgment was transcribed. The order granting the application shall contain an updated judgment summary as provided in RCW 4.64.030. The filing fee required under this subsection shall be included in the judgment summary and shall be a recoverable cost. The application shall be granted as a matter of right, subject to review only for timeliness, factual issues of full or partial satisfaction, or errors in calculating the judgment summary amounts.</p>

<li>
<p>A party who obtains a judgment or order for restitution pursuant to a criminal judgment and sentence, or the assignee or the current holder thereof, may execute, garnish, and/or have legal process issued upon the judgment or order any time within <strong>10</strong> years subsequent to the entry of the judgment and sentence or <strong>10</strong> years following the offender's release from total confinement as provided in chapter 9.94A RCW. The clerk of superior court, or a party designated by the clerk, may seek extension under subsection (3) of this section for purposes of collection as allowed under RCW 36.18.190, <strong>only if the court finds that the offender has willfully failed to pay the restitution obligation, as described in RCW 9.94A.6333 and 9.94B.040. No</strong> filing fee shall be required <strong>for filing a petition for an extension pursuant to this subsection</strong>.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>A party who obtains a judgment or order for a crime victims' assessment, or other court-ordered legal financial obligations other than restitution, pursuant to a criminal judgment and sentence, or the assignee or the current holder thereof, may execute, garnish, and/or have legal process issued upon the judgment or order any time within five years subsequent to the entry of the judgment and sentence or five years following the offender's release from total confinement as provided in chapter 9.94A RCW.</strong></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The perfection of any judgment lien and the priority of that judgment lien on property as established by RCW 6.13.090 and chapter 4.56 RCW is not altered by the extension of the judgment pursuant to the provisions of this section and the lien remains in full force and effect and does not have to be rerecorded after it is extended. Continued perfection of a judgment that has been transcribed to other counties and perfected in those counties may be accomplished after extension of the judgment by filing with the clerk of the other counties where the judgment has been filed either a certified copy of the order extending the judgment or a certified copy of the docket of the matter where the judgment was extended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as ordered in RCW 4.16.020 (2) or (3), chapter 9.94A RCW, or chapter 13.40 RCW, no judgment is enforceable for a period exceeding <strong>20</strong> years from the date of entry in the originating court. Nothing in this section may be interpreted to extend the expiration date of a foreign judgment beyond the expiration date under the laws of the jurisdiction where the judgment originated.</p>

<p>The judgment creditor may at any time when execution might issue on a like judgment against a private person, and after acknowledging satisfaction of the judgment as in ordinary cases, obtain from the clerk a certified transcript of the judgment. The clerk shall include in the transcript a copy of the memorandum of acknowledgment of satisfaction and the entry thereof as the basis for an order on the treasurer for payment.

<p>The term &quot;due diligence,&quot; as used in subsection (4) of this section, includes but is not limited to the creditor or the creditor's representative personally visiting the premises, contacting the occupants and inquiring about their relationship to the judgment debtor, contacting immediate neighbors of the premises, and searching the records of the auditor of the county in which the property is located to determine if a declaration of homestead or nonabandonment has been recorded by the judgment debtor. An examination of the debtor in supplemental proceedings on the points to be covered in the affidavit constitutes &quot;due diligence.&quot;</p>

<li>
<p>The affidavit required by this section shall include:</p>

<li>
<p>If the execution is against real or personal property in the hands of a personal representative, heir, devisee, legatee, tenant of real property, or trustee, it shall require the officer to satisfy the judgment out of such property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the execution is for the delivery of real or personal property, it shall particularly describe the property and state its value and require the officer to deliver possession of it to the party entitled thereto, and may, at the same time, require the officer to satisfy any charges, damages, or rents and profits recovered by the same judgment, out of the personal property of the party against whom it was rendered. If the property described in the execution cannot be delivered, and if sufficient personal property cannot be found to satisfy the judgment, it shall be satisfied out of the real property of the party against whom the judgment was rendered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the execution is to enforce obedience to any order, it shall particularly command what is required to be done or to be omitted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the nature of the case requires it, the execution may embrace two or more of the requirements of this section.</p>
