## **10.82.090 - Interest on judgments—Disposition of nonrestitution interest.**
1. Except as provided in subsection**s** (2) **and (3)** of this section **and RCW 3.50.100, 3.62.020, and 35.20.220**, restitution imposed in a judgment shall bear interest from the date of the judgment **or the offender's date of release from total confinement, whichever is later,** until payment, at the rate applicable to civil judgments. As of June 7, 2018, no interest shall accrue on nonrestitution legal financial obligations. **All nonrestitution interest that accrued prior to June 7, 2018, shall be automatically waived without motion of the defendant.** All nonrestitution interest retained by the court shall be split **25** percent to the state treasurer for deposit in the state general fund, **25** percent to the state treasurer for deposit in the judicial information system account as provided in RCW 2.68.020, **25** percent to the county current expense fund, and **25** percent to the county current expense fund to fund local courts.

2. **The court may elect not to impose interest on any restitution the court orders. Before determining not to impose interest on restitution, the court shall inquire into and consider the following factors: (a) Whether the offender is indigent as defined in RCW 10.101.010(3) or general rule 34; (b) the offender's available funds, as defined in RCW 10.101.010(2), and other liabilities including child support and other legal financial obligations; (c) whether the offender is homeless; and (d) whether the offender is mentally ill, as defined in RCW 71.24.025. The court shall also consider the victim's input, if any, as it relates to any financial hardship caused to the victim if interest is not imposed. The court may also consider any other information that the court believes, in the interest of justice, relates to not imposing interest on restitution. After consideration of these factors, the court may waive the imposition of restitution interest.**

3. The court may, on motion by the offender, following the offender's release from total confinement, reduce or waive the interest on legal financial obligations levied as a result of a criminal conviction as follows:

    a. The court shall waive all interest on the portions of the legal financial obligations that are not restitution that accrued prior to June 7, 2018;

    b. The court may **waive or** reduce interest on the restitution portion of the legal financial obligations only if the principal has been paid in full . The court may grant the motion, establish a payment schedule, and retain jurisdiction over the offender for purposes of reviewing and revising the reduction or waiver of interest.

4. This section only applies to adult offenders.
