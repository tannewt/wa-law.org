As of June 7, 2018, no interest shall accrue on nonrestitution legal financial obligations. <strong>All nonrestitution interest that is outstanding on the effective date of this section, and that accrued prior to June 7, 2018, shall be automatically waived without motion of the defendant.</strong> All nonrestitution interest retained by the court shall be split <strong>25</strong> percent to the state treasurer for deposit in the state general fund, <strong>25</strong> percent to the state treasurer for deposit in the judicial information system account as provided in RCW 2.68.020, <strong>25</strong> percent to the county current expense fund, and <strong>25</strong> percent to the county current expense fund to fund local courts.</p>

The court shall also consider the victim's input, if any, as it relates to any financial hardship caused to the victim if interest is not imposed. The court may also consider any other information that the court believes, in the interest of justice, relates to not imposing interest on restitution. After consideration of these factors, the court may waive the imposition of restitution interest.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court may, on motion by the offender,</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>waive or</strong> reduce interest on the restitution portion of the legal financial obligations only if the principal has been paid in full . The court may grant the motion, establish a payment schedule, and retain jurisdiction over the offender for purposes of reviewing and revising the reduction or waiver of interest.</p>
