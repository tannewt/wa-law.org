<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the work of the state suicide prevention plan steering committee has produced a valuable, comprehensive suicide prevention plan. This plan finds that about one-half of mental health conditions appear by age 14 and identifies a need for preventing youth suicide risk farther upstream in a child's life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to establish a youth suicide review team to complement the work of the state suicide prevention plan steering committee by providing a focused investigation of the lives of youth who have died by suicide. The work of the review team shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Provide a more detailed picture of the lives of youth who have died by suicide in Washington to allow for more targeted intervention programs to reach youth earlier in their lives; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic or the state's response to the pandemic have impacted youth suicide rates.</p>

<li>
<p>The department shall establish the Washington youth suicide review team to review the circumstances related to suicides occurring among youth up to age 24. The Washington youth suicide review shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Perform an in-depth review of each instance of persons under 24 years old who have died by suicide in Washington during the 2020 calendar year. The review may not include suicides that occur within the boundaries of an Indian reservation if the tribal government opposes the review;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analyze circumstances affecting the lives of the persons who have been reviewed to ascertain the existence of any common factors that may have contributed to the persons' suicide. The analysis may include a systematic review of medical records, including mental health information, home interviews of parents and caretakers of the person, analysis of individual case information, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the state's response to the pandemic; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compile statistics to establish a description of the lives of youth in Washington who have died by suicide and recommendations for targeting intervention programs to reach youth at risk for suicide earlier in life.</p>
