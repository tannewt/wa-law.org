<ol>
<li>
<p>A peace officer may not engage in a vehicular pursuit, unless:</p>
<p>a.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There is reasonable suspicion a person in the vehicle has committed or is committing a</p>
<p><strong>criminal offense,</strong> and the safety risks of failing to apprehend or identify the person are considered to be greater than the safety risks of the vehicular pursuit under the circumstances;</p>
<pre><code>b. **The officer notifies a supervising officer immediately upon initiating the vehicular pursuit, informing the supervisor of** the justification for the vehicular pursuit and other safety considerations, including but not limited to speed, weather, traffic, road conditions, and the known presence of minors in the vehicle
</code></pre>
<p><strong>;</strong></p>
<pre><code>c. **The officer, in consultation with the supervising officer, considers** alternatives to the vehicular pursuit
</code></pre>
<p><strong>;</strong></p>
<pre><code>d. **The officer complies** with any agency procedures for designating the primary pursuit vehicle and determining the appropriate number of vehicles permitted to participate in the vehicular pursuit **; and**

<li>
<p><strong>A vehicular pursuit not meeting the requirements under subsection (1) of this section must be terminated.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A peace officer may not fire a weapon upon a moving vehicle unless necessary to protect against an imminent threat of serious physical harm resulting from the operator's or a passenger's use of a deadly weapon. For the purposes of this subsection, a vehicle is not considered a deadly weapon unless the operator is using the vehicle as a deadly weapon and no other reasonable means to avoid potential serious harm are immediately available to the officer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section, &quot;vehicular pursuit&quot; means an attempt by a uniformed peace officer in a vehicle equipped with emergency lights and a siren to stop a moving vehicle where the operator of the moving vehicle appears to be aware that the officer is signaling the operator to stop the vehicle and the operator of the moving vehicle appears to be willfully resisting or ignoring the officer's attempt to stop the vehicle by increasing vehicle speed, making evasive maneuvers, or operating the vehicle in a reckless manner that endangers the safety of the community or the officer.</p>
