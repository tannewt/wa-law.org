<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/69_food_drugs_cosmetics_and_poisons/69.48_drug_take-back_program.html">69.48.010</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/69_food_drugs_cosmetics_and_poisons/69.48_drug_take-back_program.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Abuse, fatal overdoses, and poisonings from prescription and over-the-counter medicines used in the home have emerged as an epidemic in recent years. Poisoning is the leading cause of unintentional injury-related death in Washington, and more than ninety percent of poisoning deaths are due to drug overdoses. Poisoning by prescription and over-the-counter medicines is also one of the most common means of suicide and suicide attempts, with poisonings involved in more than twenty-eight thousand suicide attempts between 2004 and 2013.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Home medicine cabinets are the most common source of prescription drugs that are diverted and misused. Studies find about seventy percent of those who abuse prescription medicines obtain the drugs from family members or friends, usually for free. People who are addicted to heroin often first abused prescription opiate medicines. Unused, unwanted, and expired medicines that accumulate in homes increase risks of drug abuse, overdoses, and preventable poisonings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A safe system for the collection and disposal of unused, unwanted, and expired medicines is a key element of a comprehensive strategy to prevent prescription drug abuse, but disposing of medicines by flushing them down the toilet or placing them in the garbage can contaminate groundwater and other bodies of water, contributing to long-term harm to the environment and animal life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature therefore finds that it is in the interest of public health to establish a single, uniform, statewide system of regulation for safe and secure collection and disposal of medicines through  drug &quot;take-back&quot; program<strong>s</strong> operated and funded by drug manufacturers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2-2231">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-2231">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that in 2018, the legislature passed Engrossed Substitute House Bill No. 1047, which required drug manufacturers that sell drugs into Washington to operate a drug take-back program to collect and dispose of prescription and over-the-counter drugs. Further, the legislature finds that there is uncertainty about whether, under current law, more than one drug take-back program may operate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to clearly authorize the department of health to approve and allow the operation of multiple drug take-back programs that meet all statutory requirements.</p>

<li>
<p>A drug take-back program must develop and provide a system of promotion, education, and public outreach about the safe storage and secure collection of covered drugs. This system may include signage, written materials to be provided at the time of purchase or delivery of covered drugs, and advertising or other promotional materials. At a minimum, each program must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Promote the safe storage of legend drugs and nonlegend drugs by residents before secure disposal through a drug take-back program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discourage residents from disposing of covered drugs in solid waste collection, sewer, or septic systems;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote the use of the drug take-back program so that where and how to return covered drugs is widely understood by residents, pharmacists, retail pharmacies, health care facilities and providers, veterinarians, and veterinary hospitals;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish a toll-free telephone number and website publicizing collection options and collection sites and discouraging improper disposal practices for covered drugs, such as flushing them or placing them in the garbage;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare educational and outreach materials that: Promote safe storage of covered drugs; discourage the disposal of covered drugs in solid waste collection, sewer, or septic systems; and describe how to return covered drugs to the drug take-back program. The materials must use plain language and explanatory images to make collection services and discouraged disposal practices readily understandable to all residents, including residents with limited English proficiency;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disseminate the educational and outreach materials described in (e) of this subsection to pharmacies, health care facilities, and other interested parties for dissemination to covered entities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work with authorized collectors to develop a readily recognizable, consistent design of collection receptacles, as well as clear, standardized instructions for covered entities on the use of collection receptacles.

<p>Annually report on its promotion, outreach, and public education activities in its annual report required by RCW 69.48.100.</p>

<p>If more than one drug take-back program is approved by the department, the programs must coordinate their promotional activities to ensure that all state residents can easily identify, understand, and access the collection services provided by any drug take-back program. Coordination efforts must include providing residents with a single toll-free telephone number and single website to access information about collection services for every approved program**, including presenting all available collection sites, mail-back distribution locations, and take-back events to ensure residents are able to access the most convenient method of collection, regardless of the program operator, and must manage requests for prepaid, preaddressed mailing envelopes from covered entities and from retail pharmacies as provided in RCW 69.48.060(3)(e)**.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pharmacies and other entities that sell medication in the state are encouraged to promote secure disposal of covered drugs through the use of one or more approved drug take-back programs. Upon request, a pharmacy must provide materials explaining the use of approved drug take-back programs to its customers. The program operator must provide pharmacies with these materials upon request and at no cost to the pharmacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department, the health care authority, the department of social and health services, the department of ecology, and any other state agency that is responsible for health, solid waste management, and wastewater treatment shall, through their standard educational methods, promote safe storage of prescription and nonprescription drugs by covered entities, secure disposal of covered drugs through a drug take-back program, and the toll-free telephone number and website for approved drug take-back programs. Local health jurisdictions and local government agencies are encouraged to promote approved drug take-back programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Shall conduct a survey of covered entities and a survey of pharmacists, health care providers, and veterinarians who interact with covered entities on the use of medicines after the first full year of operation of the drug take-back program, and again every two years thereafter. Survey questions must: Measure consumer awareness of the drug take-back program; assess the extent to which collection sites and other collection methods are convenient and easy to use; assess knowledge and attitudes about risks of abuse, poisonings, and overdoses from drugs used in the home; and assess covered entities' practices with respect to unused, unwanted, or expired drugs, both currently and prior to implementation of the drug take-back program; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May, upon review of results of public awareness surveys, direct a program operator for an approved drug take-back program to modify the program's promotion and outreach activities to better achieve widespread awareness among Washington state residents and health care professionals about where and how to return covered drugs to the drug take-back program.</p>
