Participants in these meetings should discuss issues of mutual concern, and should work to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Identify the extent and nature of the achievement gap and strategies necessary to close it;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase mutual awareness and understanding of the importance of accurate, high quality curriculum materials about the history, culture, and government of local tribes; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage school boards to identify and adopt curriculum that includes tribal experiences and perspectives, so that Indian students are more engaged and learn more successfully, and so that all students learn about the history, culture, government, and experiences of their Indian peers and neighbors.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>By December 1, 2008, and every two years thereafter through 2012, the school directors' association shall report to the education committees of the legislature regarding the progress made in the development of effective government-to-government relations, the narrowing of the achievement gap, and the identification and adoption of curriculum regarding tribal history, culture, and government.

<p>The Washington state school directors' association shall adopt a model policy and procedure that school districts may use for granting waivers to individual students of up to two credits required for high school graduation based on unusual circumstances. The purpose of the model policy and procedure is to assist school districts in providing all students the opportunity to complete graduation requirements without discrimination and without disparate impact on groups of students. The model policy must take into consideration the unique limitations of a student that may be associated with such circumstances as homelessness, limited English proficiency, medical conditions that impair a student's opportunity to learn, or disabilities, regardless of whether the student has an individualized education program or a plan under section 504 of the federal rehabilitation act of 1973. The model policy must also address waivers if the student has not been provided with an opportunity to retake classes or enroll in remedial classes free of charge during the first four years of high school. The Washington state school directors' association must distribute the model policy and procedure to all school districts in the state that grant high school diplomas by June 30, 2015.</p>
