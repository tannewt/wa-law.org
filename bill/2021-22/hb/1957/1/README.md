# House Bill 1957

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/House%20Bills/1957.xml)
## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that for small businesses impacted by destructive weather events and other natural disasters, financial relief and recovery resources are often necessary for survival. Many small businesses that close due to a disaster will never reopen or will close permanently after two years.

2. The legislature further finds that disaster aid is critical to small businesses that may need financing yet struggle with accessing capital due to lack of financial documentation, lack of collateral, credit issues, or being perceived as not bankable. After a disaster, small businesses may deplete savings, borrow from family or friends, take out second mortgages, or grow credit card debt to stay afloat.

3. The legislature further finds that short-term aid, or gap funding, would help retain businesses, jobs, and community resilience while businesses await longer-term financing after a disaster.

4. Therefore, the legislature intends to establish a grant program to provide financial assistance to small businesses in the immediate aftermath of a disaster.


## Section 2
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [43.330](/rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.330_department_of_commerce.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.330_department_of_commerce.md) for context.

    a. Annual gross receipts of $5,000,000 or less; and
