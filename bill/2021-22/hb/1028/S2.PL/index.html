<h2 id="section-1-2359">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-2359">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature acknowledges that passing the evidence-based assessment of teaching effectiveness, known as the edTPA, may be a barrier to some candidates becoming fully certificated teachers in Washington. The legislature seeks to promote academic success and reduce barriers for all students, particularly candidates of color, candidates for whom English is a second language, and candidates from low-income households. The legislature is also concerned that candidates from low-income households have difficulty paying for the edTPA, which is administered by a third party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the state approval process requires each teacher preparation program to ensure that teacher candidates demonstrate the most recently published interstate teacher assessment and support consortium standards, the state-adopted cultural competency standards, and the state-adopted social-emotional learning standards. The legislature recognizes that teacher candidates may demonstrate their knowledge, skills, and competencies in a variety of ways and settings. The legislature trusts that teacher preparation programs can use multiple measures to evaluate whether teacher candidates meet or exceed the standards, without relying on a statewide assessment. Therefore, the legislature intends to eliminate taking or passing the edTPA as a prerequisite for residency teacher state certification. Nothing in this legislation prohibits a teacher preparation program from using the edTPA as a formative tool so long as notification is included in all program descriptions.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The  board shall adopt a set of articulated teacher knowledge, skill, and performance standards for effective teaching that are evidence-based, measurable, meaningful, and documented in high quality research as being associated with improved student learning. The standards shall be calibrated for each level along the entire career continuum. <strong>For candidates recommended for residency teacher certification by a board-approved preparation program, the standards adopted by the board must be the most recent teaching standards published by a consortium of state and national education organizations dedicated to the reform of the preparation, licensing, and ongoing professional development of teachers since 1987.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In developing the standards, the board shall, to the extent possible, incorporate standards for cultural competency**, as defined in RCW 28A.410.260,** along the entire continuum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By January 1, 2020, in order to ensure that teachers can recognize signs of emotional or behavioral distress in students and appropriately refer students for assistance and support, the  board shall incorporate along the entire continuum the social-emotional learning standards and benchmarks recommended by the social-emotional learning benchmarks work group in its October 1, 2016, final report titled, &quot;addressing social emotional learning in Washington's K-12 public schools.&quot; In incorporating the social-emotional learning standards and benchmarks, the  board must include related competencies, such as trauma-informed practices, consideration of adverse childhood experiences, mental health literacy, antibullying strategies, and culturally sustaining practices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The  board shall adopt a definition of master teacher, with a comparable level of increased competency between professional certification level and master level as between professional certification level and national board certification. Within the definition established by the  board, teachers certified through the national board for professional teaching standards shall be considered master teachers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>3.</p>
<p>Award of a professional certificate shall be based on a minimum of two years of successful teaching experience as defined by the board, and may not require candidates to enroll in a professional certification program.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>Educator preparation programs approved to offer the residency teaching certificate shall be required to demonstrate how the program produces effective teachers as evidenced by <strong>multiple</strong> measures <strong>of the knowledge, skills, performance, and competencies described in subsection (1) of this section</strong> and other criteria established by the  board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Each board-approved teacher preparation program must publish, and provide to candidates prior to admission, a list of program completion requirements.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Before a board-approved teacher preparation program may recommend a candidate for residency teacher certification, the candidate must meet or exceed the knowledge, skill, performance, and competency standards described in subsection (1) of this section.</strong></p>
