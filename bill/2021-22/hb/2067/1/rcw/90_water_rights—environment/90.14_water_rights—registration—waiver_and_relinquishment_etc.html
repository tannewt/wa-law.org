<p>The future growth and development of the state is dependent upon effective management and efficient use of the state's water resources. The purpose of this chapter is to provide adequate records for efficient administration of the state's waters, and to cause a return to the state of any water rights which are no longer exercised by putting said waters to beneficial use.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Extensive uncertainty exists regarding the volume of private claims to water in the state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such uncertainty seriously retards the efficient utilization and administration of the state's water resources, and impedes the fullest beneficial use thereof;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A strong beneficial use requirement as a condition precedent to the continued ownership of a right to withdraw or divert water is essential to the orderly development of the state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enforcement of the state's beneficial use policy is required by the state's rapid growth;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All rights to divert or withdraw water, except riparian rights which do not diminish the quantity of water remaining in the source such as boating, swimming, and other recreational and aesthetic uses must be subjected to the beneficial use requirement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The availability for appropriation of additional water as a result of the requirements of this chapter will accelerate growth, development, and diversification of the economy of the state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Water rights will gain sufficient certainty of ownership as a result of this chapter to become more freely transferable, thereby increasing the economic value of the uses to which they are put, and augmenting the alienability of titles to land.</p>

<p>A new period for filing statements of claim for water rights is established. The filing period shall begin September 1, 1997, and shall end at midnight June 30, 1998. Each person or entity claiming under state law a right to withdraw or divert and beneficially use surface water under a right that was established before *the effective date of [the] water code established by chapter 117, Laws of 1917, and any person claiming under state law a right to withdraw and beneficially use groundwater under a right that was established before **the effective date of the groundwater code established by chapter 263, Laws of 1945, shall register the claim with the department during the filing period unless the claim has been filed in the state water rights claims registry before July 27, 1997. A person who claims such a right and fails to register the claim as required is conclusively deemed to have waived and relinquished any right, title, or interest in the right. A statement filed during this filing period shall be filed as provided in RCW 90.14.051 and 90.14.061 and shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter regarding statements of claim. This reopening of the period for filing statements of claim shall not affect or impair in any respect whatsoever any water right existing prior to July 27, 1997. A water right embodied in a statement of claim filed under this section is subordinate to any water right embodied in a permit or certificate issued under chapter 90.03 or 90.44 RCW prior to the date the statement of claim is filed with the department and is subordinate to any water right embodied in a statement of claim filed in the water rights claims registry before July 27, 1997.</p>
