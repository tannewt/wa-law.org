# House Bill 1128

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/House%20Bills/1128.xml)
## Section 1
1. The legislature finds the following:

    a. Housing for low-income and middle-income households is a public purpose;

    b. Providing local governments with more options to increase residential capacity, especially in urban areas, consistent with RCW 43.21C.420 is essential to fulfill this public purpose;

    c. A history of segregation and displacement has led to disparities in access to education, living wage employment, affordable housing, and transportation, particularly for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color communities. This history has also allowed certain populations to obtain and build wealth and to access critical resources at the expense of others. Over time these factors have put pressure on, marginalized, and displaced many from these same communities;

    d. Black, Hispanic, and American Indian residents in the King, Pierce, and Snohomish county region experience disproportionate housing cost burden and are more likely to be renters than homeowners. According to 2018 data from the federal housing and urban development department, the rates of homeownership for Black residents were half the rate for White residents of the region. Black renters are also 30 percent more likely to be cost-burdened than White renters, and Black homeowners are 38 percent more likely to be cost-burdened than White homeowners. Similar disparities exist for Hispanic populations whose rates of homeownership are 58 percent of the rate of White homeownership, are 17 percent more likely to be rental cost-burdened than White renters, and 25 percent more likely to be owner cost-burdened than White homeowners. American Indian populations have rates of homeownership that are 71 percent that of White residents, are 12 percent more likely to be rental cost-burdened than White renters, and eight percent more likely to be owner cost-burdened than White homeowners;

    e. According to the fair housing equity assessment for the central Puget Sound region published by the Puget Sound regional council in 2014:

        i. Black residents continue to be the most segregated racial group in the region, which data suggests cannot be explained by income differences among racial groups; and

        ii. White and Asian residents are more likely to live in census tracts with high or very high access to opportunity relative to the total population when compared to foreign-born, American Indian, Hispanic, and Black residents who are more likely to live in census tracts with low or very low access to opportunity relative to the total population. Living in poverty is associated with a higher likelihood of living in an area of low or very low access to opportunity, but this cannot explain why Black and Hispanic persons living in poverty are more likely to live in areas of low or very low access to opportunity than their White or Asian peers;

    f. Publicly funded salaried professionals and paraprofessionals such as teachers, firefighters, law enforcement officers, nurses, social workers, and transit operators cannot afford to live in the districts in which they serve due to increasing housing costs;

    g. Employees of nonprofit organizations who help deliver essential public services on contract, as well as those who help provide essential services to the poor and infirm as part of their organizational mission, are similarly housing cost-constrained;

    h. The failure to make adequate provision for low-income and middle-income housing pushes many households to seek housing further away from work, which leads to increased greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, as well as congestion on state managed transportation infrastructure, so providing for more low-income and middle-income housing would enable the state to better meet established goals for greenhouse gas emissions reduction and commute trip reduction;

    i. Better public policy outcomes, including improvements and benefits to transportation infrastructure and business, will occur if public servants and nonprofit employees can afford to live in the districts they serve;

    j. Communities across the state are facing an affordable housing crisis and there is a particularly acute need for affordable housing in the Puget Sound region. With historic investments in transit in the Puget Sound region, communities have the unprecedented and urgent opportunity to plan for, invest in, and build additional affordable housing, ensuring the region gets the most out of these investments in transit while meeting critical economic, environmental, and equity goals; and

    k. Housing can drive economic growth within neighborhoods if developed with a focus on services, jobs, infrastructure improvements, open spaces, and other elements that make housing vital and economically additive to nearby residents and the region as a whole.

2. The legislature intends with this act to authorize the creation of housing benefit districts in order to produce more affordable low-income and middle-income housing to enable all members of the workforce to live in the district in which they serve, including members of racial and ethnic groups disproportionately experiencing adverse housing outcomes, to make sure that the transportation and housing investments in our state help to foster racial equity and rectify discriminatory practices.

## Section 5
1. Beginning with taxes levied for collection in calendar year 2022, the legislative authority of a district may impose a regular property tax levy, not to exceed $1 per $1,000 of the assessed value of property in the district, for the exclusive purpose of providing funding for the purposes described in sections 3 and 6 of this act. The tax proposition may be submitted at a general or special election. The tax may be imposed for each year for six consecutive years when specifically authorized by a majority of the registered voters in the district voting on a proposition under this subsection. Ballot propositions must conform with RCW 29A.36.210.

2. A district may provide for the retirement of voter-approved general obligation bonds, issued for capital purposes only, by levying bond retirement ad valorem property tax levies in excess of the one percent limitation whenever authorized by the voters of the district pursuant to Article VII, section 2(b) of the Washington state Constitution and RCW 84.52.056.

3. To carry out the purposes of this act and notwithstanding RCW 39.36.020(1), a district may issue general obligation bonds without voter approval, not to exceed an amount, together with any other outstanding nonvoter-approved general obligation indebtedness of the district, equal to 1.5 percent of the value of taxable property within the district, as the term "value of the taxable property" is defined in RCW 39.36.015. A district may additionally issue general obligation bonds for capital purposes only, together with any outstanding general obligation indebtedness, not to exceed an amount equal to five percent of the value of the taxable property within the district, as the term "value of the taxable property" is defined in RCW 39.36.015, when authorized by the voters of the district pursuant to Article VIII, section 6 of the Washington state Constitution, and may also provide for the retirement thereof by excess property tax levies as provided in subsection (2) of this section. The district may, if applicable, submit a single proposition to the voters that, if approved, authorizes both the issuance of the bonds and the bond retirement property tax levies.

4. Districts may issue general obligation bonds in accordance with chapter 39.46 RCW that mature within 40 years.

5. Whenever general obligation bonds are issued to fund specific projects or enterprises that generate revenues, the district may specifically pledge all or a portion of the revenues to pay the principal of and interest on the general obligation bonds. The district may also pledge any other revenues that may be available to the district.

6. In addition to general obligation bonds, a district may issue revenue bonds to be issued and sold in accordance with chapter 39.46 RCW.

7. For purposes of this section, "regular property tax levy" means a levy subject to the limitations provided for in Article VII, section 2 of the Washington state Constitution or by statute. The limitations in RCW 84.52.043 shall not apply to the tax levy authorized in this section.


## Section 6
1. Any moneys received from the taxes imposed or bonds issued under this chapter must be spent to implement or reimburse jurisdictions for implementing the purposes of this chapter, including the following:

    a. Station area planning strategies, including creating new or updating existing plans, identifying a community vision, assessing the current regulatory environment and identify possible barriers to affordable housing development, assessing displacement risk for current low-income residents and underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities, creating a displacement mitigation plan, promoting equitable homeownership opportunities for underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities, and assessing alternate pathways to ownership models such as community land trusts and limited or shared equity cooperatives;

    b. Land acquisition, based on station area plans and working with local jurisdictions and both nonprofit and for-profit developers to acquire, assemble, lease, land bank parcels, or sell, in cases where the station area plan clearly demonstrates that it is not financially feasible to lease all development parcels, with the net proceeds directed to subsidies for affordable housing and to promote community land trusts and infrastructure costs; and

    c. Infrastructure development, such as area-wide environmental plans, sewers, and sidewalks.

2. Up to one percent of revenue generated by the taxes imposed under this act may be used to:

    a. Cover the actual costs incurred by the advisory board created in section 7 of this act in the performance of its oversight and technical assistance duties; and

    b. Compensate housing finance commission staff providing support to the advisory board.


## Section 7

    a. Authorize development in one or more areas of not fewer than five hundred acres that include at least one train station served by commuter rail or light rail with an average of at least fifty residential units per acre that require no more than an average of one on-site parking space per two bedrooms in the portions of multifamily zones that are located within the areas;

    b. Authorize development in one or more areas of not fewer than two hundred acres in cities with a population greater than forty thousand or not fewer than one hundred acres in cities with a population less than forty thousand that include at least one bus stop served by scheduled bus service of at least four times per hour for twelve or more hours per day with an average of at least twenty-five residential units per acre that require no more than an average of one on-site parking space per two bedrooms in portions of the multifamily zones that are located within the areas;

    c. Authorize at least one duplex, triplex, quadplex, sixplex, stacked flat, townhouse, or courtyard apartment on each parcel in one or more zoning districts that permit single-family residences unless a city documents a specific infrastructure of physical constraint that would make this requirement unfeasible for a particular parcel;

    d. Authorize a duplex, triplex, quadplex, sixplex, stacked flat, townhouse, or courtyard apartment on one or more parcels for which they are not currently authorized;

    e. Authorize cluster zoning or lot size averaging in all zoning districts that permit single-family residences;

    f. Adopt a subarea plan pursuant to RCW 43.21C.420;

    g. Adopt a planned action pursuant to RCW 43.21C.440(1)(b)(ii), except that an environmental impact statement pursuant to RCW 43.21C.030 is not required for such an action;

    h. Adopt increases in categorical exemptions pursuant to RCW 43.21C.229 for residential or mixed-use development;

    i. Adopt a form-based code in one or more zoning districts that permit residential uses. "Form-based code" means a land development regulation that uses physical form, rather than separation of use, as the organizing principle for the code;

    j. Authorize a duplex on each corner lot within all zoning districts that permit single-family residences;

    k. Allow for the division or redivision of land into the maximum number of lots through the short subdivision process provided in chapter 58.17 RCW;

    l. Authorize a minimum net density of six dwelling units per acre in all residential zones, where the residential development capacity will increase within the city. For purposes of this subsection, the calculation of net density does not include the square footage of areas that are otherwise prohibited from development, such as critical areas, the area of buffers around critical areas, and the area of roads and similar features;

    m. Create one or more zoning districts of medium density in which individual lots may be no larger than three thousand five hundred square feet and single-family residences may be no larger than one thousand two hundred square feet;

    n. Authorize accessory dwelling units in one or more zoning districts in which they are currently prohibited;

    o. Remove minimum residential parking requirements related to accessory dwelling units;

    p. Remove owner occupancy requirements related to accessory dwelling units;

    s. Adopt standards for administrative approval of final plats pursuant to RCW 58.17.100;

    t. Adopt ordinances authorizing administrative review of preliminary plats pursuant to RCW 58.17.095;

    u. Adopt other permit process improvements where it is demonstrated that the code, development regulation, or ordinance changes will result in a more efficient permit process for customers;

    v. Update use matrices and allowable use tables that eliminate conditional use permits and administrative conditional use permits for all housing types, including single-family homes, townhomes, multifamily housing, low-income housing, and senior housing, but excluding essential public facilities;

    w. Allow off-street parking to compensate for lack of on-street parking when private roads are utilized or a parking demand study shows that less parking is required for the project;

    x. Develop a local program that offers homeowners a combination of financing, design, permitting, or construction support to build accessory dwelling units. A city may condition this program on a requirement to provide the unit for affordable home ownership or rent the accessory dwelling unit for a defined period of time to either tenants in a housing subsidy program as defined in RCW 43.31.605(14) or to tenants whose income is less than eighty percent of the city or county median family income. If the city includes an affordability requirement under the program, it must provide additional incentives, such as:

        i. Density bonuses;

        ii. Height and bulk bonuses;

        iii. Fee waivers or exemptions;

        iv. Parking reductions; or

    v. Expedited permitting; and

    y. Develop a local program that offers homeowners a combination of financing, design, permitting, or construction support to convert a single-family home into a duplex, triplex, or quadplex where those housing types are authorized. A local government may condition this program on a requirement to provide a certain number of units for affordable home ownership or to rent a certain number of the newly created units for a defined period of time to either tenants in a housing subsidy program as defined in RCW 43.31.605(14) or to tenants whose income is less than eighty percent of the city or county median family income. If the city includes an affordability requirement, it must provide additional incentives, such as:

        i. Density bonuses;

        ii. Height and bulk bonuses;

        iii. Fee waivers or exemptions;

        iv. Parking reductions; or

    v. Expedited permitting.

2. A city planning pursuant to RCW 36.70A.040 may adopt a housing action plan as described in this subsection. The goal of any such housing plan must be to encourage construction of additional affordable and market rate housing in a greater variety of housing types and at prices that are accessible to a greater variety of incomes, including strategies aimed at the for-profit single-family home market. A housing action plan may utilize data compiled pursuant to RCW 36.70A.610. The housing action plan should:

    a. Quantify existing and projected housing needs for all income levels, including extremely low-income households, with documentation of housing and household characteristics, and cost-burdened households;

    b. Develop strategies to increase the supply of housing, and variety of housing types, needed to serve the housing needs identified in (a) of this subsection;

    c. Analyze population and employment trends, with documentation of projections;

    d. Consider strategies to minimize displacement of low-income residents resulting from redevelopment;

    e. Review and evaluate the current housing element adopted pursuant to RCW 36.70A.070, including an evaluation of success in attaining planned housing types and units, achievement of goals and policies, and implementation of the schedule of programs and actions;

    f. Provide for participation and input from community members, community groups, local builders, local realtors, nonprofit housing advocates, and local religious groups; and

    g. Include a schedule of programs and actions to implement the recommendations of the housing action plan.

3. If adopted by April 1, 2023, ordinances, amendments to development regulations, and other nonproject actions taken by a city to implement the actions specified in subsection (1) of this section, with the exception of the action specified in subsection (1)(f) of this section, are not subject to administrative or judicial appeal under chapter 43.21C RCW.

4. Any action taken by a city prior to April 1, 2023, to amend their comprehensive plan, or adopt or amend ordinances or development regulations, solely to enact provisions under subsection (1) of this section is not subject to legal challenge under this chapter.

5. In taking action under subsection (1) of this section, cities are encouraged to utilize strategies that increase residential building capacity in areas with frequent transit service and with the transportation and utility infrastructure that supports the additional residential building capacity.

6. A city that is planning to take at least two actions under subsection (1) of this section, and that action will occur between July 28, 2019, and April 1, 2021, is eligible to apply to the department for planning grant assistance of up to one hundred thousand dollars, subject to the availability of funds appropriated for that purpose. The department shall develop grant criteria to ensure that grant funds awarded are proportionate to the level of effort proposed by a city, and the potential increase in housing supply or regulatory streamlining that could be achieved. Funding may be provided in advance of, and to support, adoption of policies or ordinances consistent with this section. A city can request, and the department may award, more than one hundred thousand dollars for applications that demonstrate extraordinary potential to increase housing supply or regulatory streamlining.

7. A city seeking to develop a housing action plan under subsection (2) of this section **or participating jurisdictions required to adopt a housing action plan under section 3(5) of this act are** eligible to apply to the department for up to one hundred thousand dollars.

8. The department shall establish grant award amounts under subsections (6) and (7) of this section based on the expected number of cities **or participating jurisdictions** that will seek grant assistance, to ensure that all cities **and participating jurisdictions** can receive some level of grant support. If funding capacity allows, the department may consider accepting and funding applications from cities with a population of less than twenty thousand if the actions proposed in the application will create a significant amount of housing capacity or regulatory streamlining and are consistent with the actions in this section.

9. In implementing chapter 348, Laws of 2019, cities are encouraged to prioritize the creation of affordable, inclusive neighborhoods and to consider the risk of residential displacement, particularly in neighborhoods with communities at high risk of displacement.


## Section 9
> This section modifies existing section [82.14.410](/rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.14_local_retail_sales_and_use_taxes.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.14_local_retail_sales_and_use_taxes.md) for context.

1. A local sales and use tax change adopted after December 1, 2000, must provide an exemption for those sales of lodging for which, but for the exemption, the total sales tax rate imposed on sales of lodging would exceed the greater of:

    a. Twelve percent; or

    b. The total sales tax rate that would have applied to the sale of lodging if the sale were made on December 1, 2000.

2. For the purposes of this section:

    a. "Local sales and use tax change" is defined as provided in RCW 82.14.055.

    b. "Sale of lodging" means the sale of or charge made for the furnishing of lodging and all other services by a hotel, rooming house, tourist court, motel, trailer camp, and the granting of any similar license to use real property.

    c. "Total sales tax rate" means the combined rates of all state and local taxes imposed under this chapter and chapters 36.100, 67.28, 67.40, and 82.08 RCW, and any other tax authorized after March 29, 2001, if the tax is in the nature of a sales tax collected from the buyer, but excluding taxes imposed under RCW 81.104.170 before December 1, 2000, and taxes imposed under RCW 82.14.530 **and section 4 of this act**.


## Section 10
> This section modifies existing section [84.52.043](/rcw/84_property_taxes/84.52_levy_of_taxes.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/84_property_taxes/84.52_levy_of_taxes.md) for context.

Within and subject to the limitations imposed by RCW 84.52.050 as amended, the regular ad valorem tax levies upon real and personal property by the taxing districts hereafter named are as follows:

1. Levies of the senior taxing districts are as follows: (a) The levies by the state may not exceed the applicable aggregate rate limit specified in RCW 84.52.065 (2) or (4) adjusted to the state equalized value in accordance with the indicated ratio fixed by the state department of revenue to be used exclusively for the support of the common schools; (b) the levy by any county may not exceed one dollar and eighty cents per thousand dollars of assessed value; (c) the levy by any road district may not exceed two dollars and twenty-five cents per thousand dollars of assessed value; and (d) the levy by any city or town may not exceed three dollars and thirty-seven and one-half cents per thousand dollars of assessed value. However any county is hereby authorized to increase its levy from one dollar and eighty cents to a rate not to exceed two dollars and forty-seven and one-half cents per thousand dollars of assessed value for general county purposes if the total levies for both the county and any road district within the county do not exceed four dollars and five cents per thousand dollars of assessed value, and no other taxing district has its levy reduced as a result of the increased county levy.
