<h2 id="section-1-1797">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1797">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes the important role housing authorities play in providing much needed affordable housing to more than 35,000 households through their inventory of rental housing, including through workforce housing programs where housing authorities keep rents as low as possible and operate on very thin margins.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that for nearly 30 years without issue, objection, or complaint, housing authorities have been contracting with property management services companies for site operations at unsubsidized workforce housing properties. The legislature further finds that it is critical to continue efforts to preserve and expand naturally occurring workforce housing units statewide. Therefore, the legislature recognizes that, at unsubsidized housing authority properties, tenant rents and deposits paid to property management companies and used to pay for regular maintenance and operations are private funds and such maintenance work is not a public work.</p>
