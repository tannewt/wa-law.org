<p>Pursuant to rules adopted by the superintendent of public instruction for the administration of this chapter, the superintendent of public instruction shall carry out a program for highly capable students. Such program may include conducting, coordinating and aiding in research (including pilot programs), disseminating information to local school districts, providing statewide staff development, and allocating to school districts supplementary funds for additional costs of district programs, as provided by RCW 28A.150.260.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that, for highly capable students, access to accelerated learning and enhanced instruction is access to a basic education. There are multiple definitions of highly capable, from intellectual to academic to artistic. The research literature strongly supports using multiple criteria to identify highly capable students, and therefore, the legislature does not intend to prescribe a single method. Instead, the legislature intends to  authorize school districts to identify through the use of multiple, objective criteria those students most highly capable and eligible to receive accelerated learning and enhanced instruction in the program offered by the district.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>S</strong>chool districts may establish and operate, either separately or jointly, programs for highly capable students. Such authority shall include the right to employ and pay special instructors and to operate such programs jointly with a public institution of higher education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>S</strong>chool districts <strong>that</strong> establish and operate programs for highly capable students shall adopt identification procedures and provide educational opportunities as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>In accordance with rules adopted by the superintendent of public instruction, school districts shall implement procedures for <strong>referral</strong>, <strong>screening,</strong> assessment <strong>,</strong> selection**, and placement** of their most highly capable students.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p><strong>Referrals must</strong> be based upon data from teachers, other staff, parents, students, and members of the community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, each school district must conduct universal screenings for each student at least once, in or before second and sixth grade, to find students who need further assessment to determine whether the student is eligible for potential placement in a program for highly capable students. The district must use a portion of the funds appropriated to provide the screenings within the school day and at the school the student attends.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assessment<strong>s****for highly capable program services must</strong> be based upon a review of each student's capability as shown by multiple criteria intended to reveal, from a wide variety of sources and data, each student's unique needs and capabilities. <strong>Assessments must be conducted within the school day and at the school the student attends.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selection <strong>and placements</strong> shall be made by a <strong>multidisciplinary selection committee</strong> after consideration of the results of the multiple criteria assessment. <strong>The committee members must have at least five hours of course work or professional development addressing the needs and characteristics of highly capable students. Students selected pursuant to procedures outlined in this section shall be provided, to the extent feasible, an educational opportunity that takes into account each student's unique needs and capabilities, and the limits of the resources and program options available to the district, including those options that can be developed or provided using funds allocated by the superintendent of public instruction for that specific purpose.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In addition to the criteria listed in (a) of this subsection, district practices for identifying the most highly capable students must prioritize equitable identification of low-income students.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a student, <strong>including a student</strong> who is a child of a military family in transition, has been assessed or enrolled as highly capable by a sending school, the receiving school shall initially honor placement of the student into a like program.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The receiving school shall determine whether the district's program is a like program when compared to the sending school's program; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The receiving school may conduct subsequent assessments to determine appropriate placement and continued enrollment in the program.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access to accelerated learning and enhanced instruction through a program for highly capable students does not constitute an individual entitlement for any particular student.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For a student who is a child of a military family in transition, t</strong>he definitions in Article II of RCW 28A.705.010 apply to subsection (3) of this section.</p>
