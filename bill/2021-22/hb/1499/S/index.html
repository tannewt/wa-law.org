<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that substance use disorder is among the only health conditions for which a person can be arrested for displaying symptoms. People use drugs to escape the painful reality of their lives and circumstances, including trauma that has never had a chance to heal. Causing more hurt through the trauma of incarceration will not produce a willingness to change, only more pain to numb. Arrest and incarceration do not treat the root causes of substance use disorder. Treating substance abuse disorder like a crime through arrests and incarceration further disrupts and destabilizes the lives of these individuals. Incarceration removes access to insurance and behavioral health services, places people with opioid use disorder at extraordinary risk of overdose upon release, and creates criminal records that erect long-term barriers to education, housing, and employment, all of which undermine efforts to achieve and maintain recovery. The diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder includes continued use despite negative consequences. Therefore, it is implausible that additional negative consequences will lead to a cessation of use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that substance use disorder is a treatable brain disease from which people recover. Based on surveys conducted at syringe service programs, the vast majority of people who are using drugs want to reduce or stop their use. The barrier to these individuals engaging in treatment is not an absence of pain, but an absence of hope. When people in active substance use disorder are offered meaningful, person-centered support and interventions from a trusted source, such as a peer recovery coach, they are very likely to accept that support. If recovery support services, such as housing, education, employment pathways, community connection, and peer support are available during and after treatment, long-term, sustained recovery is not only possible, but probable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to develop a robust system to provide rapid access to evidence-based and innovative substance use treatment and comprehensive recovery support services in lieu of criminal penalties for individuals in possession of drugs.</p>
</li>

<blockquote>
<p>This section adds a new section to an existing chapter <a href="/rcw/41_public_employment_civil_service_and_pensions/41.05_state_health_care_authority.html">41.05</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/41_public_employment_civil_service_and_pensions/41.05_state_health_care_authority.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The authority shall establish a substance use recovery services plan to implement measures to assist persons with substance use disorder in accessing treatment and recovery support services that are low-barrier, person-centered, informed by people with lived experience, and culturally and linguistically appropriate. The plan must articulate the manner in which continual, rapid, and widespread access to a comprehensive continuum of care must be provided to all persons with substance use disorder regardless of the point at which they present within the continuum of care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The plan must consider the following: The manner in which persons with substance use disorder currently access and interact with the behavioral health system; the points of intersection that persons with substance use disorder have with the health care, criminal, legal, and child welfare systems, including emergency departments, syringe service programs, law enforcement, correctional facilities, and dependency court; and the various locations in which persons with untreated substance use disorder congregate including homeless encampments, motels, and casinos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The plan must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Anticipate the decriminalization of personal use amounts of controlled substances, counterfeit substances, and legend drugs known to be used by people for recreational or nonmedical and nonprescribed purposes as provided in section 5 of this act;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include potential new community-based care access points, including the safe station model in partnership with fire departments, and strategic grant making to community organizations to educate the public and systematically disrupt and dismantle stigma and prejudice against persons with substance use disorder by improving public understanding and promoting hope;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include creative mechanisms for real time, peer-driven, noncoercive outreach and engagement to individuals in active substance use disorder across all settings and develop measures to enhance the effectiveness of and opportunities for intervention across new and existing points of contact with this population; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support diversion to community-based care for individuals who may face criminal consequences for other drug-related law violations, but for whom it is evident that a response that addresses and attends to the underlying needs and social determinants of health may be more effective.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The plan and related rules adopted by the authority must include the following substance use treatment and recovery services, which must be available in or accessible by all jurisdictions: Field-based outreach and engagement; peer recovery support services; intensive case management; substance use disorder treatment, including evidence-based treatment, promising practices, and innovative approaches; and recovery support services including housing, job training, and placement services. These services must be equitably distributed across urban and rural settings and, if possible, made available on demand through 24 hour, seven days a week peer recovery coach response, behavioral health triage centers, or other innovative rapid response models. These services must, at a minimum, incorporate the following principles: Low barrier to entry and reentry; improve the health and safety of the individual; reduce the harm of substance use and related activity for the public; integrated and coordinated services; incorporate structural competency and antiracism; noncoercive methods of retaining people in treatment and recovery services, including contingency management; consideration of the unique needs of rural communities; and services that increase social determinants of health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In developing the plan, the authority shall strive to adopt and implement the recommendations of the substance use recovery services advisory committee established in section 3 of this act. Where adoption and implementation of recommendations are infeasible, the authority shall notify the advisory committee and request refinement or modification of recommendations for implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority must submit the substance use recovery services plan to the governor and the legislature by December 1, 2021. After submitting the plan, the authority shall adopt rules and enter into contracts with providers to implement the plan by December 1, 2022. In addition to seeking public comment under chapter 34.05 RCW, the authority must adopt rules in accordance with the recommendations of the substance use recovery services advisory committee as provided in subsection (5) of this section. The rules must be informed by existing diversion models that the authority administers in multiple jurisdictions in the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority must submit a readiness report to the governor and the legislature by November 1, 2022, that indicates progress on the substance use disorder continuum of care, including availability of outreach, treatment, and recovery support services, as well as system preparedness for the decriminalization policies in sections 6 through 11 of this act to take effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In consultation with the substance use recovery services advisory committee, the authority must submit a report on the implementation of the substance use recovery services plan to the appropriate committees of the legislature and governor by December 1st of each year, beginning in 2022.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;recovery support services&quot; means a collection of nontreatment resources that sustain long-term recovery from substance use disorder, including recovery housing, employment and education supports, peer recovery coaching, family education, technological recovery supports, transportation and child care assistance to facilitate treatment participation and early recovery, and social connectedness.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The advisory committee must make recommendations and provide perspectives to the authority regarding:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Current regional capacity for existing public and private programs providing substance use disorder assessments, each of the American society of addiction medicine levels of care, and recovery support services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Barriers to accessing the existing health system for those populations chronically exposed to criminal legal system responses relating to complex behavioral health conditions and the consequences of trauma, and possible innovations that could reduce those barriers and improve the quality and accessibility of care for those populations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evidence-based, research-based, and promising treatment and recovery services appropriate for target populations, to include, but not be limited to, field-based outreach and engagement, case management, mental and physical health care, contingency management, medication-assisted treatment and other innovative medication therapies, peer support services, family education, housing, job training and employment programs, and treatments that have not traditionally been covered by insurance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Workforce needs for the behavioral health services sector, including wage and retention challenges;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Options for leveraging existing integrated managed care, medicaid waiver, American Indian or Alaska Native fee-for-service behavioral health benefits, and private insurance service capacity for substance use disorders, including but not limited to coordination with managed care organizations, behavioral health administrative services organizations, the Washington health benefit exchange, accountable communities of health, and the office of the insurance commissioner;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Framework and design assistance for jurisdictions to assist in compliance with the requirements of RCW 10.31.110 for diversion of individuals with complex behavioral health conditions to community-based care whenever possible and appropriate, and identifying resource gaps that impede jurisdictions in fully realizing the potential impact of this approach;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The design of a referral mechanism for referring people with substance use disorder or problematic behaviors resulting from drug use into the supportive services described in this section, including intercepting individuals who likely would otherwise be referred into the criminal legal system, with the express intention of ensuring that decriminalization of possession of personal use amounts does not inadvertently contribute to increased racial disparity among those who continue to be exposed to the criminal legal system due to income instability and involvement in the illicit economy to meet basic needs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The design of ongoing qualitative and quantitative research about the types of services desired by people with substance use disorders and barriers they experience in accessing existing and recommended services; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proposing a funding framework in which, over time, resources are shifted from punishment sectors to community-based care interventions such that community-based care becomes the primary strategy for addressing and resolving public order issues related to behavioral health conditions.</p>
