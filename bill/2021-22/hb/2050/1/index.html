<h2 id="section-1-2914">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-2914">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The purpose of this act is to repeal RCW 13.40.220 and 13.16.085, also known as the &quot;parent pay&quot; statutes, which require parents to pay a percentage of their gross income for the cost of their child's support, treatment, and confinement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The parent pay statutes essentially operate as a legal financial obligation assessed on parents for their child's incarceration. These laws disproportionally impact poorer parents and represent a dated policy and philosophy that is not aligned with current racial equity and social justice reforms. Pursuing these parents is unfair and takes advantage of people at their most vulnerable, undermining government credibility and the integrity of the legal process. Placing these parents in debt may also result in unstable home environments, deterring successful youth reentry back into the community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that eliminating parents' financial obligation to pay for their child's incarceration will advance racial equity and help to support a successful transition to adulthood for young people in juvenile detention and in the department's care.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3-1786">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-1786">¶</a></h2>
