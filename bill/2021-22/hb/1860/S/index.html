<li>
<p>The legislature finds that social determinants of health, particularly housing, are highly correlated with long-term recovery from behavioral health conditions. Seeking inpatient treatment for a mental health or substance use challenge is an act of valor. Upon discharge from care, these individuals deserve a safe, stable place from which to launch their recovery. It is far easier and more cost-effective to help maintain a person's recovery after treatment than to discharge them into homelessness and begin the process anew amid another crisis. Sometimes, there may not be another chance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to seize the incredible opportunity presented by a person seeking inpatient behavioral health care by ensuring that these courageous individuals are discharged to appropriate housing.</p>
