<li>
<p>It shall be the duty of the director to establish and administer a program of benefits to innocent victims of criminal acts within the terms and limitations of this chapter. The director may apply for and, subject to appropriation, expend federal funds under Public Law 98-473 and any other federal program providing financial assistance to state crime victim compensation programs. The federal funds shall be deposited in the state general fund and may be expended only for purposes authorized by applicable federal law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Establish and adopt rules governing the administration of this chapter in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regulate the proof of accident and extent thereof, the proof of death, and the proof of relationship and the extent of dependency;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supervise the medical, surgical, and hospital treatment to the intent that it may be in all cases efficient and up to the recognized standard of modern surgery;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issue proper receipts for moneys received and certificates for benefits accrued or accruing;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Designate a medical director who is licensed under chapter 18.57 or 18.71 RCW;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supervise the providing of prompt and efficient care and treatment, including care provided by physician assistants governed by the provisions of chapters 18.57A and 18.71A RCW, acting under a supervising physician, including chiropractic care, and including care provided by licensed advanced registered nurse practitioners, to victims at the least cost consistent with promptness and efficiency, without discrimination or favoritism, and with as great uniformity as the various and diverse surrounding circumstances and locations of industries will permit and to that end shall, from time to time, establish and adopt and supervise the administration of printed forms, electronic communications, rules, regulations, and practices for the furnishing of such care and treatment. The medical coverage decisions of the department do not constitute a &quot;rule&quot; as used in RCW 34.05.010(16), nor are such decisions subject to the rule-making provisions of chapter 34.05 RCW except that criteria for establishing medical coverage decisions shall be adopted by rule. The department may recommend to a victim particular health care services and providers where specialized treatment is indicated or where cost-effective payment levels or rates are obtained by the department, and the department may enter into contracts for goods and services including, but not limited to, durable medical equipment so long as statewide access to quality service is maintained for injured victims;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In consultation with interested persons, establish and, in his or her discretion, periodically change as may be necessary, and make available a fee schedule of the maximum charges to be made by any physician, surgeon, chiropractor, hospital, druggist, licensed advanced registered nurse practitioner, and physician assistants as defined in chapters 18.57A and 18.71A RCW, acting under a supervising physician or other agency or person rendering services to victims. The department shall coordinate with other state purchasers of health care services to establish as much consistency and uniformity in billing and coding practices as possible, taking into account the unique requirements and differences between programs. No service covered under this title, including services provided to victims, whether aliens or other victims, who are not residing in the United States at the time of receiving the services, shall be charged or paid at a rate or rates exceeding those specified in such fee schedule, and no contract providing for greater fees shall be valid as to the excess. The establishment of such a schedule, exclusive of conversion factors, does not constitute &quot;agency action&quot; as used in RCW 34.05.010(3), nor does such a fee schedule constitute a &quot;rule&quot; as used in RCW 34.05.010(16). Payments for providers' services under the fee schedule established pursuant to this subsection (2) may not be less than payments provided for comparable services under the workers' compensation program under Title 51 RCW, provided:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>If the department, using caseload estimates, projects a deficit in funding for the program by July 15th for the following fiscal year, the director shall notify the governor and the appropriate committees of the legislature and request funding sufficient to continue payments to not less than payments provided for comparable services under the workers' compensation program. If sufficient funding is not provided to continue payments to not less than payments provided for comparable services under the workers' compensation program, the director shall reduce the payments under the fee schedule for the following fiscal year based on caseload estimates and available funding, except payments may not be reduced to less than seventy percent of payments for comparable services under the workers' compensation program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an unforeseeable catastrophic event results in insufficient funding to continue payments to not less than payments provided for comparable services under the workers' compensation program, the director shall reduce the payments under the fee schedule to not less than seventy percent of payments provided for comparable services under the workers' compensation program, provided that the reduction may not be more than necessary to fund benefits under the program; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once sufficient funding is provided or otherwise available, the director shall increase the payments under the fee schedule to not less than payments provided for comparable services under the workers' compensation program;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a record of the commencement of every disability and the termination thereof and, when bills are rendered for the care and treatment of injured victims, shall approve and pay those which conform to the adopted rules, regulations, established fee schedules, and practices of the director and may reject any bill or item thereof incurred in violation of the principles laid down in this section or the rules, regulations, or the established fee schedules and rules and regulations adopted under it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director and his or her authorized assistants:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Have power to issue subpoenas to enforce the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production and examination of books, papers, photographs, tapes, and records before the department in connection with any claim made to the department or any billing submitted to the department. The superior court has the power to enforce any such subpoena by proper proceedings;</p>

<p>May apply for and obtain a superior court order approving and authorizing a subpoena in advance of its issuance. The application may be made in the county where the subpoenaed person resides or is found, or the county where the subpoenaed records or documents are located, or in Thurston county. The application must (A) state that an order is sought pursuant to this subsection; (B) adequately specify the records, documents, or testimony; and (C) declare under oath that an investigation is being conducted for a lawfully authorized purpose related to an investigation within the department's authority and that the subpoenaed documents or testimony are reasonably related to an investigation within the department's authority.</p>

<li>
<p>The director and his or her authorized assistants may seek approval and a court may issue an order under this subsection without prior notice to any person, including the person to whom the subpoena is directed and the person who is the subject of an investigation.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>In all hearings, actions, or proceedings before the department, any physician or licensed advanced registered nurse practitioner having theretofore examined or treated the claimant may be required to testify fully regarding such examination or treatment, and shall not be exempt from so testifying by reason of the relation of the physician or licensed advanced registered nurse practitioner to the patient.</p>

<li>
<p>No right of action at law for damages incurred as a consequence of a criminal act shall be lost as a consequence of being entitled to benefits under the provisions of this chapter. The victim or his or her beneficiary may elect to seek damages from the person or persons liable for the claimed injury or death, and such victim or beneficiary is entitled to the full compensation and benefits provided by this chapter regardless of any election or recovery made pursuant to this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, the rights, privileges, responsibilities, duties, limitations, and procedures contained in subsections (3) through (25) of this section apply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If a third person is or may become liable to pay damages on account of a victim's injury for which benefits and compensation are provided under this chapter, the injured victim or beneficiary may elect to seek damages from the third person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In every action brought under this section, the plaintiff shall give notice to the department when the action is filed. The department may file a notice of statutory interest in recovery. When such notice has been filed by the department, the parties shall thereafter serve copies of all notices, motions, pleadings, and other process on the department. The department may then intervene as a party in the action to protect its statutory interest in recovery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this subsection, &quot;injury&quot; includes any physical or mental condition, disease, ailment, or loss, including death, for which compensation and benefits are paid or payable under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this chapter, &quot;recovery&quot; includes all damages and insurance benefits, including life insurance, paid in connection with the victim's injuries or death.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An election not to proceed against the third person operates as an assignment of the cause of action to the department, which may prosecute or compromise the action in its discretion in the name of the victim, beneficiary, or legal representative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an injury to a victim results in the victim's death, the department to which the cause of action has been assigned may petition a court for the appointment of a special personal representative for the limited purpose of maintaining an action under this chapter and chapter 4.20 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a beneficiary is a minor child, an election not to proceed against a third person on such beneficiary's cause of action may be exercised by the beneficiary's legal custodian or guardian.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any recovery made by the department shall be distributed as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The department shall be paid the expenses incurred in making the recovery including reasonable costs of legal services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The victim or beneficiary shall be paid twenty-five percent of the balance of the recovery made, which shall not be subject to subsection (8) of this section, except that in the event of a compromise and settlement by the parties, the victim or beneficiary may agree to a sum less than twenty-five percent;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall be paid the amount paid to or on behalf of the victim or beneficiary by the department; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The victim or beneficiary shall be paid any remaining balance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thereafter no payment shall be made to or on behalf of a victim or beneficiary by the department for such injury until any further amount payable shall equal any such remaining balance. Thereafter, such benefits shall be paid by the department to or on behalf of the victim or beneficiary as though no recovery had been made from a third person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the victim or beneficiary elects to seek damages from the third person, any recovery made shall be distributed as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The costs and reasonable attorneys' fees shall be paid proportionately by the victim or beneficiary and the department. The department may require court approval of costs and attorneys' fees or may petition a court for determination of the reasonableness of costs and attorneys' fees;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The victim or beneficiary shall be paid twenty-five percent of the balance of the award, except that in the event of a compromise and settlement by the parties, the victim or beneficiary may agree to a sum less than twenty-five percent;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall be paid the balance of the recovery made, but only to the extent necessary to reimburse the department for the amount paid;</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The department shall bear its proportionate share of the costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the victim or beneficiary to the extent of the benefits paid under this title. The department's proportionate share shall not exceed one hundred percent of the costs and reasonable attorneys' fees;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department's proportionate share of the costs and reasonable attorneys' fees shall be determined by dividing the gross recovery amount into the benefits paid amount and multiplying this percentage times the costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the victim or beneficiary;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department's reimbursement share shall be determined by subtracting their proportionate share of the costs and reasonable attorneys' fees from the benefits paid amount;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any remaining balance shall be paid to the victim or beneficiary; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thereafter no payment shall be made to or on behalf of a victim or beneficiary by the department for such injury until the amount of any further amount payable shall equal any such remaining balance minus the department's proportionate share of the costs and reasonable attorneys' fees in regards to the remaining balance. This proportionate share shall be determined by dividing the gross recovery amount into the remaining balance amount and multiplying this percentage times the costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the victim or beneficiary. Thereafter, such benefits shall be paid by the department to or on behalf of the victim or beneficiary as though no recovery had been made from a third person.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The recovery made shall be subject to a lien by the department for its share under this section. Notwithstanding RCW 48.18.410, a recovery made from life insurance shall be subject to a lien by the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department has sole discretion to compromise the amount of its lien. In deciding whether or to what extent to compromise its lien, the department shall consider at least the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The likelihood of collection of the award or settlement as may be affected by insurance coverage, solvency, or other factors relating to the third person;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Factual and legal issues of liability as between the victim or beneficiary and the third person. Such issues include but are not limited to possible contributory negligence and novel theories of liability; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Problems of proof faced in obtaining the award or settlement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>It shall be the duty of the person to whom any recovery is paid before distribution under this section to advise the department of the fact and amount of such recovery, the costs and reasonable attorneys' fees associated with the recovery, and to distribute the recovery in compliance with this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The distribution of any recovery made by award or settlement of the third party action shall be confirmed by department order, served by electronic, registered or certified mail, and shall be subject to chapter 51.52 RCW. In the event the order of distribution becomes final under chapter 51.52 RCW, the director or the director's designee may file with the clerk of any county within the state a warrant in the amount of the sum representing the unpaid lien plus interest accruing from the date the order became final. The clerk of the county in which the warrant is filed shall immediately designate a superior court cause number for such warrant and the clerk shall cause to be entered in the judgment docket under the superior court cause number assigned to the warrant, the name of such victim or beneficiary mentioned in the warrant, the amount of the unpaid lien plus interest accrued and the date when the warrant was filed. The amount of such warrant as docketed shall become a lien upon the title to and interest in all real and personal property of the victim or beneficiary against whom the warrant is issued, the same as a judgment in a civil case docketed in the office of such clerk. The sheriff shall then proceed in the same manner and with like effect as prescribed by law with respect to execution or other process issued against rights or property upon judgment in the superior court. Such warrant so docketed shall be sufficient to support the issuance of writs of garnishment in favor of the department in the manner provided by law in the case of judgment, wholly or partially unsatisfied. The clerk of the court shall be entitled to a filing fee under RCW 36.18.012(10), which shall be added to the amount of the warrant. A copy of such warrant shall be mailed to the victim or beneficiary within three days of filing with the clerk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director, or the director's designee, may issue to any person, firm, corporation, municipal corporation, political subdivision of the state, public corporation, or agency of the state, a notice and order to withhold and deliver property of any kind if he or she has reason to believe that there is in the possession of such person, firm, corporation, municipal corporation, political subdivision of the state, public corporation, or agency of the state, property which is due, owing, or belonging to any victim or beneficiary upon whom a warrant has been served by the department for payments due to the crime victims' compensation program. The notice and order to withhold and deliver shall be served by the sheriff of the county or by the sheriff's deputy; by certified mail, return receipt requested; or by any authorized representatives of the director. Any person, firm, corporation, municipal corporation, political subdivision of the state, public corporation, or agency of the state upon whom service has been made shall answer the notice within twenty days exclusive of the day of service, under oath and in writing, and shall make true answers to the matters inquired of in the notice and order to withhold and deliver. In the event there is in the possession of the party named and served with such notice and order, any property which may be subject to the claim of the department, such property shall be delivered forthwith to the director or the director's authorized representative upon demand. If the party served and named in the notice and order fails to answer the notice and order within the time prescribed in this section, the court may, after the time to answer such order has expired, render judgment by default against the party named in the notice for the full amount claimed by the director in the notice together with costs. In the event that a notice to withhold and deliver is served upon an employer and the property found to be subject thereto is wages, the employer may assert in the answer to all exemptions provided for by chapter 6.27 RCW to which the wage earner may be entitled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may require the victim or beneficiary to exercise the right of election under this chapter by serving a written demand by electronic mail, registered mail, certified mail, or personal service on the victim or beneficiary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless an election is made within sixty days of the receipt of the demand, and unless an action is instituted or settled within the time granted by the department, the victim or beneficiary is deemed to have assigned the action to the department. The department shall allow the victim or beneficiary at least ninety days from the election to institute or settle the action. When a beneficiary is a minor child the demand shall be served upon the legal custodian or guardian of such beneficiary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an action which has been filed is not diligently prosecuted, the department may petition the court in which the action is pending for an order assigning the cause of action to the department. Upon a sufficient showing of a lack of diligent prosecution the court in its discretion may issue the order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the department has taken an assignment of the third party cause of action under subsection (16) of this section, the victim or beneficiary may, at the discretion of the department, exercise a right of reelection and assume the cause of action subject to reimbursement of litigation expenses incurred by the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the victim or beneficiary elects to seek damages from the third person, notice of the election must be given to the department. The notice shall be by registered mail, certified mail, or personal service. If an action is filed by the victim or beneficiary, a copy of the complaint must be sent by registered mail to the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A return showing service of the notice on the department shall be filed with the court but shall not be part of the record except as necessary to give notice to the defendant of the lien imposed by subsection (10) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any compromise or settlement of the third party cause of action by the victim or beneficiary which results in less than the entitlement under this title is void unless made with the written approval of the department. For the purposes of this chapter, &quot;entitlement&quot; means benefits and compensation paid and estimated by the department to be paid in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a compromise or settlement is void because of subsection (21) of this section, the department may petition the court in which the action was filed for an order assigning the cause of action to the department. If an action has not been filed, the department may proceed as provided in chapter 7.24 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that the victim or beneficiary is entitled to compensation under this title shall not be pleaded or admissible in evidence in any third-party action under this chapter. Any challenge of the right to bring such action shall be made by supplemental pleadings only and shall be decided by the court as a matter of law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actions against third persons that are assigned by the claimant to the department, voluntarily or by operation of law in accordance with this chapter, may be prosecuted by special assistant attorneys general.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The attorney general shall select special assistant attorneys general from a list compiled by the department and the Washington state bar association. The attorney general, in conjunction with the department and the Washington state bar association, shall adopt rules and regulations outlining the criteria and the procedure by which private attorneys may have their names placed on the list of attorneys available for appointment as special assistant attorneys general to litigate third-party actions under subsection (24) of this section.</p>
</li>

<p>The 1980 amendments to this section apply only to injuries which occur on or after April 1, 1980.</p>

<p>The eligibility for benefits under this chapter and the amount thereof will be governed insofar as is applicable by the provisions contained in this chapter.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Each victim injured as a result of a criminal act, including criminal acts committed between July 1, 1981, and January 1, 1983, or the victim's family or beneficiary in case of death of the victim, are eligible for benefits in accordance with this chapter, subject to the limitations under RCW 7.68.015. Except for medical benefits authorized under RCW 7.68.080, no more than forty thousand dollars shall be granted as a result of a single injury or death.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Benefits payable for temporary total disability that results in financial support for lost wages shall not exceed fifteen thousand dollars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Benefits payable for a permanent total disability or fatality that results in financial support for lost wages shall not exceed forty thousand dollars. After at least twelve monthly payments have been paid, the department shall have the sole discretion to make a final lump sum payment of the balance remaining.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the victim was not gainfully employed at the time of the criminal act, no financial support for lost wages will be paid to the victim or any beneficiaries, unless the victim was gainfully employed for a total of at least twelve weeks in the six months preceding the date of the criminal act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No victim or beneficiary shall receive compensation for or during the day on which the injury was received.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a victim's employer continues to pay the victim's wages that he or she was earning at the time of the crime, the victim shall not receive any financial support for lost wages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the director determines that a temporary total disability results in a loss of wages, the victim shall receive monthly subject to subsection (1) of this section, during the period of disability, sixty percent of the victim's monthly wage but no more than one hundred percent of the state's average monthly wage as defined in RCW 7.68.020. The minimum monthly payment shall be no less than five hundred dollars. Monthly wages shall be based upon employer wage statements, employment security records, or documents reported to and certified by the internal revenue service. Monthly wages must be determined using the actual documented monthly wage or averaging the total wages earned for up to twelve successive calendar months preceding the injury. In cases where the victim's wages and hours are fixed, they shall be determined by multiplying the daily wage the victim was receiving at the time of the injury:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>By five, if the victim was normally employed one day a week;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>By thirty, if the victim was normally employed seven days a week.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the director determines that a permanent total disability or death results in a loss of wages, the victim or eligible spouse shall receive the monthly payments established in this subsection, not to exceed forty thousand dollars or the limits established in this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The legal guardian or custodian of a minor victim shall receive up to thirty days of the legal guardian's or custodian's lost wages if the director determines that the legal guardian or custodian has lost wages due to any one or more of the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The time where the legal guardian or custodian of a minor victim accompanies the minor victim to medical or counseling services related to the crime; or</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>If the director determines that the victim is voluntarily retired and is no longer attached to the workforce, benefits shall not be paid under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of death, if there is no eligible spouse, benefits shall be paid to the child or children of the deceased victim. If there is no spouse or children, no payments shall be made under this section. If the spouse remarries before this benefit is paid in full benefits shall be paid to the victim's child or children and the spouse shall not receive further payment. If there is no child or children no further payments will be made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The benefits for disposition of remains or burial expenses shall not exceed six thousand one hundred seventy dollars per claim. Beginning July 1, 2020, the department shall adjust the amount in this subsection (10) for inflation every three years based upon changes in the consumer price index during that time period. To receive reimbursement for expenses related to the disposition of remains or burial, the department must receive an itemized statement from a provider of services within twenty-four months of the date of the claim allowance. If there is a delay in the recovery of remains or the release of remains for disposition or burial, an itemized statement from a provider of services must be received within twenty-four months of the date of the release of the remains or of the date of the claim allowance, whichever is later.</p>

<p>Any person who is responsible for the victim's injuries, or who would otherwise be unjustly enriched as a result of the victim's injuries, shall not be a beneficiary under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crime victims' compensation is not available to pay for services covered under chapter 74.09 RCW or Title XIX of the federal social security act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A victim whose crime occurred in another state who qualifies for benefits under RCW 7.68.060(6) may receive appropriate mental health counseling to address distress arising from participation in the civil commitment proceedings. Fees for counseling shall be determined by the department in accordance with RCW 51.04.030, subject to the limitations of RCW 7.68.080.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the provisions of this title relative to compensation for injuries to or death of victims become invalid because of any adjudication, or are repealed, the period intervening between the occurrence of an injury or death, not previously compensated for under this title by lump payment or completed monthly payments, and such repeal or the rendition of the final adjudication of invalidity shall not be computed as a part of the time limited by law for the commencement of any action relating to such injury or death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The benefits established in RCW 51.32.080 for permanent partial disability will not be provided to any crime victim or for any claim submitted on or after July 1, 2011.</p>

<li>
<p>Proceedings for forfeiture are commenced by a seizure. Seizure of real property shall include the filing of a lis pendens by the seizing agency. Real property seized under this section shall not be transferred or otherwise conveyed until ninety days after seizure or until a judgment of forfeiture is entered, whichever is later, except that such real property seized may be transferred or conveyed to any person or entity who acquires title by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure of a security interest.</p>

<p>The prosecuting attorney who seized the property shall cause notice to be served within fifteen days following the seizure on the owner of the property seized and the person in charge thereof and any person having any known right or interest therein, including any community property interest, of the seizure and intended forfeiture of the seized property. Service of notice of seizure of real property shall be made according to the rules of civil procedure. However, the state may not obtain a default judgment with respect to real property against a party who is served by substituted service absent an affidavit stating that a good faith effort has been made to ascertain if the defaulted party is incarcerated within the state, and that there is no present basis to believe that the party is incarcerated within the state. The notice of seizure in other cases may be served by any method authorized by law or court rule including but not limited to service by certified mail with return receipt requested.

</li>
<li>
<p>If any person notifies the seizing prosecuting attorney in writing of the person's claim of ownership or right to possession of the property within forty-five days for personal property or ninety days for real property, the person or persons shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard as to the claim or right. The prosecuting attorney shall file the case into a court of competent jurisdiction. In a court hearing between two or more claimants to the article or articles involved, the prevailing party shall be entitled to a judgment for costs and reasonable attorneys' fees. In cases involving personal property, the burden of producing evidence shall be by a preponderance and upon the person claiming to be the lawful owner or the person claiming to have the lawful right to possession of the property. In cases involving real property, the burden of producing evidence shall be by a preponderance and upon the prosecuting attorney. The seizing prosecuting attorney shall promptly return the property to the claimant upon a determination by the prosecuting attorney or court that the claimant is the present lawful owner or is lawfully entitled to possession of the property.</p>
