<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that it took specific action in the 2020 regular session to establish three pilot projects to support behavioral health and suicide prevention efforts for law enforcement officers. Due to the impacts of COVID-19 and financial uncertainties facing the state, the governor made the difficult decision to veto section 3, chapter 327, Laws of 2020 and the associated funding in the operating budget.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that law enforcement officers who are not well do not serve the public well, and declares that the pilot projects established in section 3, chapter 327, Laws of 2020 are worthy, especially in light of the impacts of COVID-19.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to again pass legislation to establish behavioral health supports and suicide prevention efforts for law enforcement officers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further intends to appropriate sufficient funding to the Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs to establish a program to support behavioral health supports and suicide prevention efforts for law enforcement officers, including awarding grants for three pilot projects for behavioral health supports and suicide prevention efforts for law enforcement officers.</p>
</li>
