<p>The legislature finds that in recognition of the cultural, treaty, economic, recreational, and legal importance of salmon in Washington, many state government agencies' role is to implement policy and laws, and they devote significant program attention and resources to supporting the recovery, viability, and protection of anadromous fish. Further, the legislature recognizes the importance of a coordinated approach to statewide salmon recovery not just between state agencies, but also in partnership with the state's tribal comanagers. The legislature intends to ensure that all pertinent state agencies share in and support the mission of recovering and protecting salmon in Washington by incorporating that goal into each agency's mission, and by creating a venue through which state agencies and tribes can come together to review overall progress towards salmon recovery. However, the legislature does not intend to reallocate among state agencies any existing programs or responsibilities related to salmon recovery in Washington through this act.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-1640">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-1640">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/77_fish_and_wildlife/77.085_salmon_recovery.html">77.85.005</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/77_fish_and_wildlife/77.085_salmon_recovery.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that repeated attempts to improve salmonid fish runs throughout the state of Washington have failed to avert listings of salmon and steelhead runs as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act (16 U.S.C. Sec. 1531 et seq.). These listings threaten the sport, commercial, and tribal fishing industries as well as the economic well-being and vitality of vast areas of the state. It is the intent of the legislature to begin activities required for the recovery of salmon stocks as soon as possible, although the legislature understands that successful recovery efforts may not be realized for many years because of the life cycle of salmon and the complex array of natural and human-caused problems they face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that it is in the interest of the citizens of the state of Washington for the state to retain primary responsibility for managing the natural resources of the state, rather than abdicate those responsibilities to the federal government, and that the state may best accomplish this objective by integrating local and regional recovery activities into a statewide strategy that can make the most effective use of provisions of federal laws allowing for a state lead in salmon recovery, delivered through implementation activities consistent with regional and watershed recovery plans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also <strong>supports the</strong> statewide salmon recovery strategy <strong>and recognizes the state's</strong> active public involvement process in order to ensure public participation in, and support for, salmon recovery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that there is a substantial link between the provisions of the federal endangered species act and the federal clean water act (33 U.S.C. Sec. 1251 et seq.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that <strong>effective</strong> habitat <strong>protection and</strong> restoration is a vital component of salmon recovery efforts. <strong>With amplified climate change effects and human population growth, the legislature must protect what the state currently has and will have in the future, and thus must vastly increase the scope and scale of restoration, also including investments and inclusion of salmon recovery in the growth management act.</strong> Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to specifically address salmon habitat <strong>protection and</strong> restoration <strong>for properly functioning watershed conditions for salmon</strong> in a coordinated manner and to develop a structure that allows for the coordinated delivery of federal, state, and local assistance to communities for habitat projects that will assist in the recovery and enhancement of salmon stocks. A strong watershed-based locally implemented plan is essential for local, regional, and statewide salmon recovery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that credible scientific review and oversight is essential for any salmon recovery effort to be successful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that it is important to monitor the overall health of the salmon resource to determine if recovery efforts are providing expected returns. It is important to monitor salmon habitat projects and salmon recovery activities to determine their effectiveness in order to secure federal acceptance of the state's approach to salmon recovery. Adaptive management <strong>will only exist with properly functioning watershed conditions for salmon</strong>. For these reasons, the legislature believes that a coordinated and integrated monitoring system should be developed and implemented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature therefore finds that a coordinated framework for responding to the salmon crisis is needed immediately. To that end, the governor's salmon recovery office should  provide overall coordination of the state's response; an independent science panel <strong>shall</strong> provide scientific review and oversight; a coordinated state funding process should be <strong>implemented</strong> through a salmon recovery funding board <strong>and the fish passage barrier removal board</strong>; the appropriate local or tribal government  provide<strong>s</strong> local leadership in identifying and sequencing habitat <strong>restoration and acquisition</strong> projects to be funded by state agencies; habitat projects should be implemented without delay; and a strong <strong>partnership between state, tribal, and</strong> locally based effort<strong>s</strong> to restore salmon habitat should be established by providing a framework to allow citizen volunteers to work effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Furthermore, the legislature declares it to be the goal of the state to support the recovery and enhancement of salmon and steelhead stocks in order to support Washington's tribal treaty obligations, support nontribal commercial and recreational fisheries, and achieve the delisting and recovery of threatened or endangered salmon and steelhead runs under the federal endangered species act. State agencies should strive to apply the laws of the state of Washington, and the rules and policies of the agency, to advance the goal established in this section.</strong></p>

<p>As Washington begins its second century of statehood, the legislature recognizes that renewed efforts are needed to preserve, conserve, and enhance the state's recreational resources. Rapid population growth and increased urbanization have caused a decline in suitable land for recreation and resulted in overcrowding and deterioration of existing facilities. Lack of adequate recreational resources directly affects the health and well-being of all citizens of the state, reduces the state's economic viability, and prevents Washington from maintaining and achieving the quality of life that it deserves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is therefore the policy of the state and its agencies to preserve, conserve, and enhance recreational resources and open space. In carrying out this policy, the mission of the recreation and conservation funding board and its office is to**:** (a) <strong>Create</strong> and work actively for the implementation of a unified statewide strategy for meeting the recreational needs of Washington's citizens**;** (b) represent and promote the interests of the state on recreational issues in concert with other state and local agencies and the governor**;** (c) encourage and provide interagency and regional coordination, and interaction between public and private organizations**;** (d) administer recreational grant-in-aid programs and provide technical assistance**;** and (e) serve as a repository for information, studies, research, and other data relating to recreation. <strong>The recreation and conservation funding board and its office must interpret their responsibilities described in this chapter, and its applicable responsibilities in carrying out its other various statutory duties and authorities established by the legislature, in a manner that is supportive of the state anadromous fish protection and recovery goal established in RCW 77.85.005(9).</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington is uniquely endowed with fresh and salt waters rich in scenic and recreational value. This outdoor heritage enriches the lives of citizens, attracts new residents and businesses to the state, and is a major support of its expanding tourist industry. Rising population, increased income and leisure time, and the rapid growth of boating and other water sports have greatly increased the demand for water related recreation, while waterfront land is rapidly rising in value and disappearing from public use. There is consequently an urgent need for the acquisition or improvement of waterfront land on fresh and salt water suitable for marine recreational use by Washington residents and visitors. To meet this need, it is necessary and proper that the portion of motor vehicle fuel taxes paid by boat owners and operators on fuel consumed in their watercraft and not reclaimed as presently provided by law should be expended for the acquisition or improvement of marine recreation land on the Pacific Ocean, Puget Sound, bays, lakes, rivers, reservoirs and other fresh and salt waters of the state.</p>
