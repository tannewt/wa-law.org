    i. Specifically identify a name of a person or persons involved in the incident;

    ii. Provide the incident or case number;

    iii. A law enforcement or corrections agency may require any person requesting a body worn camera recording pursuant to this subsection (14)(e) to identify himself or herself to ensure he or she is a person entitled to obtain the body worn camera recording under this subsection (14)(e).

    i. **Notwithstanding (a) and (e) of this subsection, an agency may provide an unredacted copy of body worn camera recordings to a defendant's attorney in a criminal matter without the disclosure being considered highly offensive, if the defendant's attorney would otherwise be entitled to receive an unredacted copy in the course of discovery in a criminal matter. The attorney receiving the unredacted copy shall sign a written agreement that the attorney will maintain exclusive custody of the unredacted copy, use the unredacted copy only for the purposes of conducting the defendant's side of the criminal case as if it had been furnished in discovery, and treat the unredacted copy as confidential as a matter of law. A defense attorney who receives an unredacted copy of body worn camera recordings under this subsection may provide a copy of the body worn camera recordings to the defendant after making redactions consistent with the requirements of this chapter.**

    ii. **Unredacted body worn camera recordings provided under a written agreement under (f)(i) of this subsection shall not be considered published or otherwise exposed to the public eye. Violation of the agreement that results in redisclosure of unredacted body worn camera recordings is presumed to be highly offensive to the extent it depicts elements outlined in (a) of this subsection or is otherwise considered highly offensive under law. In any private cause of action resulting from improper redisclosure of the recordings, the attorney may not use the receipt of the recording under this subsection as a defense. A violation of the written agreement may also result in sanctions under the civil or criminal court rules.**

A law enforcement or corrections agency responding to a request to disclose body worn camera recordings may require any requester not listed in (e) of this subsection to pay the reasonable costs of redacting, altering, distorting, pixelating, suppressing, or otherwise obscuring any portion of the body worn camera recording prior to disclosure only to the extent necessary to comply with the exemptions in this chapter or any applicable law.

    iii. In any case where an agency charges a requestor for the costs of redacting a body worn camera recording under this subsection (14)(g), the time spent on redaction of the recording shall not count towards the agency's allocation of, or limitation on, time or costs spent responding to public records requests under this chapter, as established pursuant to local ordinance, policy, procedure, or state law.

h. For purposes of this subsection (14):

i. &quot;Body worn camera recording&quot; means a video and/or sound recording that is made by a body worn camera attached to the uniform or eyewear of a law enforcement or corrections officer while in the course of his or her official duties; and
