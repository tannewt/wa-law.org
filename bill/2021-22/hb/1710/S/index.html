<p>The legislature finds that the Washington state liquor and cannabis board exists to promote safe communities and public safety. However, there is no agency to oversee research and education of the cannabis industry within the state. The legislature therefore declares:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Washington state cannabis cultivation commission is established to benefit the people of the state of Washington and its economy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The general welfare of the people of the state will be served by the development of the safe growing and processing activities of cannabis. The industry is therefore affected with the public interest; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creation of a Washington state cannabis cultivation commission for the public purpose of administering the revenue of the commission for the enhancement of the safe production of cannabis will materially advance the industries of growing and processing cannabis, improve sustainability in the growing and processing sectors, and thereby the interests of the citizens of the state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2-1681">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-1681">¶</a></h2>
<p>To complement the development of a comprehensive regulatory scheme to regulate the production and processing of cannabis and cannabis products, the legislature declares that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is in the overriding public interest that state government support responsible agricultural production of cannabis in order to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Protect the public by educating the public in reference to the quality, care, and methods used in the production of cannabis and cannabis products; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support and engage in programs or activities that benefit the safe production, handling, processing, and uses of cannabis and cannabis products; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The production of cannabis is a highly regulated industry. Other laws applicable to the cannabis industry include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Chapter 15.130 RCW, the food safety and security act;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 15.125 RCW, marijuana and marijuana products;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Title 69 RCW, food, drugs, cosmetics, and poisons; and</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="section-3-1274">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-1274">¶</a></h2>
