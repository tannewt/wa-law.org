<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that Washington is one of the largest exporters of food and agricultural goods in the country. The legislature also recognizes that growing, cultivating, and harvesting the food that we all consume is significant and important work. The legislature also recognizes that farmworkers are unique. Often, farmworkers must contend with dangers in their work environment, such as pesticides, heat, heavy equipment, and other elements, and deal with challenges such as inadequate housing and various forms of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to assess the needs of farmworkers in the state to help better serve and protect these unique workers we all depend upon.</p>
