<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the use of racially derogatory or discriminatory school mascots, logos, or team names in public schools is antithetical to their mission of providing an equal education to all, and contrary to the goal of making schools safe and respectful learning environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds also that certain mascots, logos, or team names that are or have been used by schools and other entities are uniquely discriminatory in singling out the Native American community for derision and cultural appropriation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although the inappropriate use of Native American names, symbols, or images may be premised on the promotion of unity or school spirit, their use fails to respect the cultural heritage of Native Americans and promote productive relationships between sovereign governments. Furthermore, numerous individuals and organizations, including the United States commission on civil rights, have concluded that the use of Native American images and names in school sports is a barrier to equality and understanding, and that all residents of the United States would benefit from the discontinuance of their use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature therefore, recognizing that no school has a cognizable interest in retaining a racially derogatory or discriminatory school mascot, logo, or team name, intends to prohibit the inappropriate use of Native American names, symbols, or images for those purposes.</p>
</li>
