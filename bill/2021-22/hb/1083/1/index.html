<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/59_landlord_and_tenant/59.21_mobile_home_relocation_assistance.html">59.21.005</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/59_landlord_and_tenant/59.21_mobile_home_relocation_assistance.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The legislature recognizes that it is quite costly for tenants who own homes in manufactured/mobile home parks to relocate when the park in which they reside is closed or converted to another use. Many such tenants need financial assistance in order to relocate from a manufactured/mobile home park. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a mechanism for assisting manufactured/mobile home tenants to relocate their manufactured/mobile homes to suitable alternative sites or <strong>to</strong> secure <strong>alternative</strong> housing <strong>of their choice</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-1991">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-1991">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/59_landlord_and_tenant/59.21_mobile_home_relocation_assistance.html">59.21.021</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/59_landlord_and_tenant/59.21_mobile_home_relocation_assistance.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If a manufactured/mobile home park is closed or converted to another use, eligible tenants shall be entitled to relocation assistance on a first-come, first-serve basis. The department shall give priority for distribution of relocation assistance to eligible tenants residing in parks that are closed as a result of park-owner fraud or as a result of health and safety concerns as determined by the local board of health. Payments shall be made upon the department's verification of eligibility, subject to the availability of remaining funds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eligibility for relocation assistance funds is limited to low-income households.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eligible tenants who relocate are entitled to financial assistance from the fund, up to a maximum of twelve thousand dollars for a multisection home and up to a maximum of seven thousand five hundred dollars for a single-section home. The department shall distribute relocation assistance for each eligible tenant</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>in the form of cash assistance to help the tenant secure <strong>alternative</strong> housing</p>
<p>.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>Any individual or organization may apply to receive <strong>relocation assistance</strong> from the fund, for use in combination with funds from public or private sources, toward relocation of tenants eligible under this section, with agreement from the tenant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends the cash assistance provided under
subsection (3) of this section to be considered a one-time
direct grant payment that shall be excluded from household income
calculations for purposes of determining the eligibility of the
recipient for benefits or assistance under any state program financed
in whole or in part with state funds.</p>
</li>
</ol>
