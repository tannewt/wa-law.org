<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that many workers who have paid into the paid family and medical leave insurance program have suffered job losses, reductions in hours, or an inability to reenter the workforce due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. These workers are unable to access their family and medical leave benefits under the existing hours worked threshold through no fault of their own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to temporarily adjust the qualifying periods for these adversely impacted workers to restore access to family and medical leave benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the temporary adjustment of the qualifying period for these workers, the legislature intends to prevent impacts to the family and medical leave insurance account through the provision of separate funding. In so doing, the legislature intends to avoid any premium rate increases or the application of a solvency surcharge.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="section-3-953">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-953">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This section adds a new section to an existing chapter <a href="/rcw/50A_family_and_medical_leave/50A.15_benefits.html">50A.15</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/50A_family_and_medical_leave/50A.15_benefits.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>

<p>Subsections (1) and (2) of this section do not apply to an employee who does not meet the hours worked threshold for eligibility under RCW 50A.15.010 or 50A.30.020(1) because of an employment separation due to misconduct or a voluntary separation unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An employee seeking eligibility under this section must attest, in a manner prescribed by the department, that their failure to meet the hours worked threshold for eligibility under RCW 50A.15.010 or 50A.30.020(1) is not due to the reasons specified in (a) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of determining their weekly benefit amount under RCW 50A.15.020(4), the average weekly wage of an employee qualifying for benefits under subsection (2)(c) of this section is the quotient derived by dividing the employee's total wages during the first calendar quarter of 2020 by 13. If the result is not a multiple of $1, the department must round to the next lower multiple of $1.</p>
