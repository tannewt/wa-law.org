## Section 1
> This section modifies existing section [69.22.050](/rcw/69_food_drugs_cosmetics_and_poisons/69.22_cottage_food_operations.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/69_food_drugs_cosmetics_and_poisons/69.22_cottage_food_operations.md) for context.

1. (a) **Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, the** annual gross sales of cottage food products may not exceed **$50,000**. The determination of the maximum annual gross sales must be computed on the basis of the amount of gross sales within or at a particular domestic residence and may not be computed on a per person basis within or at an individual domestic residence.

    b. **The department shall periodically review the cap on annual gross sales established in (a) of this subsection and increase the cap by rule as the department deems necessary to account for increases in costs of doing business for cottage food operations.**

2. If gross sales exceed the maximum allowable annual gross sales amount **established under subsection (1) of this section**, the cottage food operation must either obtain a food processing plant license under chapter 69.07 RCW or cease operations.

3. A cottage food operation exceeding the maximum allowable annual gross sales amount **established under subsection (1) of this section** is not entitled to a full or partial refund of any fees paid under RCW 69.22.030 or 69.22.040.

4. The director may request in writing documentation to verify the annual gross sales figure.
