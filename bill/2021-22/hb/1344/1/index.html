<li>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any person convicted of one or more crimes committed prior to the person's <strong>25th</strong> birthday may petition the indeterminate sentence review board for early release after serving no less than <strong>15</strong> years of total confinement, provided the person has not been convicted for any crime committed subsequent to the person's <strong>25th</strong> birthday, the person has not committed a disqualifying serious infraction as defined by the department in the <strong>12</strong> months prior to filing the petition for early release, and the current sentence was not imposed under RCW 10.95.030 or 9.94A.507.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No later than five years prior to the date the offender will be eligible to petition for release, the department shall conduct an assessment of the offender and identify programming and services that would be appropriate to prepare the offender for return to the community. To the extent possible, the department shall make programming available as identified by the assessment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No later than <strong>180</strong> days from receipt of the petition for early release, the department shall conduct, and the offender shall participate in, an examination of the person, incorporating methodologies that are recognized by experts in the prediction of dangerousness, and including a prediction of the probability that the person will engage in future criminal behavior if released on conditions to be set by the board. The board may consider a person's failure to participate in an evaluation under this subsection in determining whether to release the person. The board shall order the person released under such affirmative and other conditions as the board determines appropriate, unless the board determines by a preponderance of the evidence that, despite such conditions, it is more likely than not that the person will commit new criminal law violations if released. The board shall give public safety considerations the highest priority when making all discretionary decisions regarding the ability for release and conditions of release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a hearing conducted under subsection (3) of this section, the board shall provide opportunities for victims and survivors of victims of any crimes for which the offender has been convicted to present statements as set forth in RCW 7.69.032. The procedures for victim and survivor of victim input shall be provided by rule. To facilitate victim and survivor of victim involvement, county prosecutor's offices shall ensure that any victim impact statements and known contact information for victims of record and survivors of victims are forwarded as part of the judgment and sentence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An offender released by the board is subject to the supervision of the department for a period of time to be determined by the board, up to the length of the court-imposed term of incarceration. The department shall monitor the offender's compliance with conditions of community custody imposed by the court or board and promptly report any violations to the board. Any violation of conditions of community custody established or modified by the board are subject to the provisions of RCW 9.95.425 through 9.95.440.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An offender whose petition for release is denied may file a new petition for release five years from the date of denial or at an earlier date as may be set by the board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An offender released under the provisions of this section may be returned to the institution at the discretion of the board if the offender is found to have violated a condition of community custody. The offender is entitled to a hearing pursuant to RCW 9.95.435. If the board finds that the offender has committed a new violation, the board may return the offender to the institution for up to the remainder of the court-imposed term of incarceration. The offender may file a new petition for release five years from the date of return to the institution or at an earlier date as may be set by the board.</p>
