<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognized in 2020, with the enactment of Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill No. 2311, chapter 79, Laws of 2020, that Washington state needs to make significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and adopted limits that are in line with both the scientific consensus and with the limits that have been adopted around the world. The targets adopted in Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill No. 2311 were a clear next step to build on past legislative efforts, and it is the intent of the legislature to adopt this act to help our state transition as quickly as possible to clean and renewable sources of energy and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to meet the goals set in Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill No. 2311 in an economically sound way while placing environmental justice at the forefront. This act accomplishes those goals by putting a price on greenhouse gas emissions and dedicating the revenue to investments that deliver meaningful greenhouse gas reduction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that transportation emissions in the state account for 45 percent of the state's total greenhouse gas emissions and more than half of emissions covered under this act. Therefore, at least 60 percent of the revenue raised by the tax created in this act will be allocated for the miles ahead transportation investments that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Such investments are necessary to effectively address the greatest source of statewide greenhouse gas emissions while building a clean and just transportation system that will grow our economy and safely move people and goods across our state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Climate risk is economic risk and it is imperative that Washington act now to safeguard the state's communities and industries against future shocks and disasters by putting a price on practices that increase the state's exposure to risk and investing in those that increase resilience. From farmers whose business is directly threatened by the climate crisis, to coastal communities at risk of outright displacement, the state must act now by investing locally at the scale needed to move all Washingtonians toward a future of shared prosperity as we build the clean economy here in Washington state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington state is home to some of the world's most innovative companies, a highly skilled workforce, unique biodiversity and natural areas, valuable natural resource land, and important industries. As our state transitions away from a fossil fuel-based economy, we must do so in a way that protects these assets and allows our businesses to thrive. By launching a comprehensive fiscal program that incentivizes and invests in resilient infrastructure and climate-smart investments across all areas of development, we can reduce our state's carbon dioxide emissions while preparing our economy for the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that rural areas are home to the state's working and natural lands, including forests and farms, and have both climate-related challenges and opportunities that differ from urban areas. Rural workers have further distances to travel to their jobs and the state must provide assistance in the transition to lower carbon transportation options. Rural areas may also have greater vulnerability to flooding, wildfires, and other events whose harm and frequency are increased by climate change, and state assistance should be directed toward increasing community resilience to these harms. Programs to reduce carbon pollution and to sequester carbon in the state's forests and farming soils also provide an opportunity to benefit the state's farmers and forestland owners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than half of Washington is forested with 22,000,000 acres of forests covering the state, including natural and working lands, private lands, and state trust lands. Maintaining natural and working forestlands of all types is important to support both carbon sequestration and a major sector of Washington's economy. The private and state lands represent the foundation of a forest products industry. The legislature determined in RCW 70A.45.005 that maintaining and enhancing the state's ability to continue to sequester carbon through natural and working lands and forest products should be continued. These working forests are one of the state's greatest natural assets in combating global greenhouse gas emissions. A statewide carbon policy must support and maintain the ecosystem values provided by the forest products industry. Healthy, sustainable, and working forests maximize the forests' ability to absorb carbon dioxide with lumber and other forest products continuing to sequester that carbon dioxide in their useful life. For these reasons, this chapter exempts certain timber-related uses of fuels subject to the carbon pollution tax imposed under this chapter, and also creates a voluntary incentive program to increase carbon sequestration on both state and private lands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington is also home to one of the most productive and innovative agricultural sectors in the world. Agriculture is not only critical to our economy, but is also integral to our culture. With farmers and farmworkers on the front lines of climate-related disruption such as wildfire, flooding, drought, pests, and other threats to the land, labor, and business of farming, investing in practices that increase the natural and economic resilience of, and decrease the greenhouse gas emissions from, Washington agriculture is critical. Farmers have been leading the way on land stewardship and soil health for decades, while operating in a highly trade-exposed and price-constrained industry that imposes singular economic challenges. For these reasons, this chapter exempts certain agricultural uses of fuels subject to the carbon pollution tax imposed under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington is leading the transition to a clean energy economy and in 2019 adopted chapter 19.405 RCW, the Washington clean energy transformation act, to eliminate coal-fired electricity; to transition the state's electricity supply to 100 percent greenhouse gas neutral by 2030 and to 100 percent nonemitting and renewable resources by 2045; and to establish strong compliance mechanisms and significant penalties within chapter 19.405 RCW if a utility failed to meet the mandates. Because of the laws created in 2019 to transition the electricity sector to 100 percent carbon free, emissions from fossil fuels consumed in the electricity sector is not included in the requirements of this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes the concern from imposing the requirements of this chapter on energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries in our state and the possibility that it might provide a comparative advantage to producers in unregulated states or countries, leading to a migration of manufacturing to unregulated states or countries and generating a corresponding increase in greenhouse gas emissions that would undermine the efforts of this chapter. Because of the concern of leakage, the department of ecology must provide a report to the legislature by July 30, 2024, with recommendations on imposing the requirements of this chapter on energy-intensive, trade-exposed entities identified by the North American industry classification system code. The recommendations must include input from individual energy-intensive, trade-exposed industry stakeholders, allow for growth, recognize and provide credit for early actions, recognize the limits of best available control technology, allow for either internal or external benchmarking, and include an analysis of alternative fuels available that could be feasibly used in lieu of fossil fuels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fossil fuel combustion is also responsible for other pollutants, such as nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide, benzene, particulate matter, and others that contribute to respiratory diseases like asthma and lung cancer, which compromise public health, shorten life expectancy, and strain our public health system. This pollution affects all Washingtonians, but falls disproportionately on low-income communities, communities of color, and the most vulnerable of our population. While reducing our reliance on fossil fuels will contribute to improved air quality and improved public health outcomes, it is the intent of this chapter to further advance the state's ability to reduce these other pollutants by prioritizing air pollution reduction investments and regulatory measures in these overburdened communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes and finds that the public interest includes, but is not limited to: The equitable distribution of energy benefits and reduction of environmental harm to overburdened communities and vulnerable populations; long-term and short-term public health, economic, and environmental benefits and the reduction of costs and risks; and energy security and resiliency. It is the intent of the legislature that in achieving this policy for Washington, there should not be an increase in environmental health impacts to overburdened communities and vulnerable populations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This chapter establishes a carbon pollution tax to account for a significant share of the economic and environmental impacts of greenhouse gas emissions. The revenue from the tax will facilitate the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy and fund investments that will benefit our businesses, our families, and our communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, this chapter establishes a 10-year climate finance program that provides much needed additional capacity to invest in a just transition that protects our communities and our economy from future disasters and builds the low-carbon future here in Washington state. This finance program mandates that investment decisions are made in a manner that provide accountability in government spending through a fiscally responsible bond program that invests at scale in climate priorities and delivers maximum returns in the form of both economic activity and carbon pollution reduction. These investments will not only save Washington taxpayers billions of dollars in avoidable future costs, but also foster growth and stability for rural and urban communities alike, across diverse economic sectors.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>In order to achieve the goals set forth in this chapter, any state agency receiving funding from the accounts created in this chapter must consult with Indian tribes on all decisions that may affect Indian tribes' rights and interests in their tribal lands. The consultation must occur pursuant to chapter 43.376 RCW and must be independent of any public participation process required by state law, or by a state agency, and regardless of whether the agency receives a request for consultation from an Indian tribe. A consultation framework must be developed in coordination with tribal governments that includes best practices, protocols for communication, and collaboration with Indian tribes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No project that impacts tribal lands may be funded prior to meaningful consultation with affected Indian tribes. For projects that directly impact tribal lands, the goal of the consultation process is to obtain free, prior, and informed consent for the project, and at the end of such consultation, the project may not be funded unless the state agency first receives a written resolution providing consent or withholding consent. If any project that impacts tribal lands is funded under this chapter without consultation with Indian tribes, an affected Indian tribe may request that all further action on the project cease until consultation with any directly impacted Indian tribe is completed.</p>

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The department shall have all the powers as provided in RCW 70A.15.2040.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department, in addition to any other powers vested in it by law after consideration at a public hearing held in accordance with chapters 42.30 and 34.05 RCW shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Adopt rules establishing air quality objectives and air quality standards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adopt emission standards which shall constitute minimum emission standards throughout the state. An authority may enact more stringent emission standards, except for emission performance standards for new woodstoves and opacity levels for residential solid fuel burning devices which shall be statewide, but in no event may less stringent standards be enacted by an authority without the prior approval of the department after public hearing and due notice to interested parties;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adopt by rule air quality standards and emission standards for the control or prohibition of emissions to the outdoor atmosphere of radionuclides, dust, fumes, mist, smoke, other particulate matter, vapor, gas, odorous substances, or any combination thereof. Such requirements may be based upon a system of classification by types of emissions or types of sources of emissions, or combinations thereof, which it determines most feasible for the purposes of this chapter. <strong>The department may require persons who produce or distribute fossil fuels or other products that emit greenhouse gases in Washington to comply with air quality standards, emission standards, or emission limitations on emissions of greenhouse gases. If the program review in section 6 of this act finds that greenhouse gases and criteria pollutants are not being reduced in communities identified as highly impacted by the department of health's environmental health disparities map, then, as a means of ensuring that the investments identified in section 16 of this act achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and other criteria pollutants in overburdened communities highly impacted by pollution, the department shall prioritize the adoption of air quality standards, emission standards, or emission limitations on fuel suppliers or covered entities located in those areas.</strong> However, an industry, or the air pollution control authority having jurisdiction, can choose, subject to the submittal of appropriate data that the industry has quantified, to have any limit on the opacity of emissions from a source whose emission standard is stated in terms of a weight of particulate per unit volume of air (e.g., grains per dry standard cubic foot) be based on the applicable particulate emission standard for that source, such that any violation of the opacity limit accurately indicates a violation of the applicable particulate emission standard. Any alternative opacity limit provided by this section that would result in increasing air contaminants emissions in any nonattainment area shall only be granted if equal or greater emission reductions are provided for by the same source obtaining the revised opacity limit. A reasonable fee may be assessed to the industry to which the alternate opacity standard would apply. The fee shall cover only those costs to the air pollution control authority which are directly related to the determination on the acceptability of the alternate opacity standard, including testing, oversight and review of data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The air quality standards and emission standards may be for the state as a whole or may vary from area to area or source to source, except that emission performance standards for new woodstoves and opacity levels for residential solid fuel burning devices shall be statewide, as may be appropriate to facilitate the accomplishment of the objectives of this chapter and to take necessary or desirable account of varying local conditions of population concentration, the existence of actual or reasonably foreseeable air pollution, topographic and meteorologic conditions and other pertinent variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department is directed to cooperate with the appropriate agencies of the United States or other states or any interstate agencies or international agencies with respect to the control of air pollution and air contamination, or for the formulation for the submission to the legislature of interstate air pollution control compacts or agreements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department is directed to conduct or cause to be conducted a continuous surveillance program to monitor the quality of the ambient atmosphere as to concentrations and movements of air contaminants and conduct or cause to be conducted a program to determine the quantity of emissions to the atmosphere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall enforce the air quality standards and emission standards throughout the state except where a local authority is enforcing the state regulations or its own regulations which are more stringent than those of the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall encourage local units of government to handle air pollution problems within their respective jurisdictions; and, on a cooperative basis provide technical and consultative assistance therefor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall have the power to require the addition to or deletion of a county or counties from an existing authority in order to carry out the purposes of this chapter. No such addition or deletion shall be made without the concurrence of any existing authority involved. Such action shall only be taken after a public hearing held pursuant to the provisions of chapter 34.05 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall establish rules requiring sources or source categories to apply reasonable and available control methods. Such rules shall apply to those sources or source categories that individually or collectively contribute the majority of statewide air emissions of each regulated pollutant. The department shall review, and if necessary, update its rules every five years to ensure consistency with current reasonable and available control methods. The department shall have adopted rules required under this subsection for all sources by July 1, 1996.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;reasonable and available control methods&quot; shall include but not be limited to, changes in technology, processes, or other control strategies.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>By October 30, 2025, the department of ecology shall determine whether the sources of emissions covered by the tax imposed under section 3 of this act is likely to achieve the proportionate share of the emissions reductions by entities subject to the tax that is necessary for the state to achieve the emissions limits established in RCW 70A.45.020. The department of ecology may exercise this authority prior to this determination. Nothing in this chapter limits authority under chapter 70A.15 RCW. If the department of ecology determines that such reductions are not likely to meet these limits, the department of ecology shall exercise the authority provided in RCW 70A.15.3000 to adopt emissions limitations upon such entities sufficient to meet such limits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By January 1, 2026, the department of ecology must provide the legislature with a report detailing its determination with recommendations, pursuant to the tax and covered sources, for achieving the emissions limits established in RCW 70A.45.020.</p>
