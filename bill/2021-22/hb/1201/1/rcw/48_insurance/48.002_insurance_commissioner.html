The order must specify, by line of insurance:</p>

<p>Working papers, documents, materials, or information produced by, obtained by, or disclosed to the commissioner or any other person in the course of a financial or market conduct examination, or in the course of financial analysis or market conduct desk audit, are not required to be disclosed by the commissioner unless cited by the commissioner in connection with an agency action as defined in RCW 34.05.010(3). The commissioner shall notify a party that produced the documents, materials, or information five business days before disclosure in connection with an agency action. The notified party may seek injunctive relief in any Washington state superior court to prevent disclosure of any documents, materials, or information it believes is confidential or privileged.

<p>Any person may petition a Washington state superior court to allow inspection of information exempt from public disclosure under subsection (6) of this section when the information is connected to allegations of negligence or malfeasance by the commissioner related to a financial or market conduct examination. The court shall conduct an in-camera review after notifying the commissioner and every party that produced the information. The court may order the commissioner to allow the petitioner to have access to the information provided the petitioner maintains the confidentiality of the information. The petitioner must not disclose the information to any other person, except upon further order of the court. After conducting a regular hearing, the court may order that the information can be disclosed publicly if the court finds that there is a public interest in the disclosure of the information and the exemption of the information from public disclosure is clearly unnecessary to protect any individual's right of privacy or any vital governmental function.</p>

<p>Beginning March 1, 2022, and annually thereafter, each health carrier, medicaid managed care organization, and third-party administrator must file with the commissioner a statement of covered lives using the form or forms prescribed and furnished by the commissioner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For fiscal year 2023, the commissioner shall assess health carriers, medicaid managed care organizations, and third-party administrators for a per member per month assessment of $3.25.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The covered lives assessment will be $143,000,000 for fiscal year 2024 and $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2025 and each fiscal year thereafter. Based on the number of covered lives reported, all health carriers, medicaid managed care organizations, and third-party administrators must pay a pro rata share of the total assessment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The covered lives assessment collected from each health carrier, medicaid managed care organization, and third-party administrator is that proportion of the total assessment amount for the ensuing fiscal year that is represented by the health carrier's, medicaid managed care organization's, or third-party administrator's proportion of covered lives in this state during the previous fiscal year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commissioner must annually, on or before July 1st, calculate and bill each health carrier, medicaid managed care organization, and third-party administrator for the amount of the covered lives assessment. The assessment is due and payable by July 15th of each year. However, if the necessary financial records are not available in time to carry out such calculations and bill such assessments within the time specified, the commissioner may use the assessment factors from the prior year as the basis for the assessment and, if necessary, the commissioner may impose supplemental assessments to fully and properly charge the health carriers, medicaid managed care organizations, and third-party administrators. Any health carrier, medicaid managed care organization, or third-party administrator failing to pay the assessment by July 31st must pay the same penalties as the penalties for failure to pay taxes when due under RCW 48.14.060. The assessment required by this section is in addition to all other taxes and fees now imposed or that may be subsequently imposed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assessments and penalties collected under this section must be deposited in the foundational public health services account and spent according to RCW 43.70.515.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A health carrier, medicaid managed care organization, or third-party administrator is not subject to an assessment under this section if it has 50 or fewer covered lives in Washington.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an assessment against a health carrier, medicaid managed care organization, or third-party administrator is prohibited by court order, the assessment for the remaining health carriers, medicaid managed care organizations, and third-party administrators may be adjusted in a manner consistent with subsection (4) of this section to ensure that the net assessment amount calculated in subsection (3) of this section will be collected.</p>

<li>

<li>
<p>&quot;Covered lives assessment&quot; means the fees imposed by this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Health carrier&quot; means every health care service contractor, as defined in RCW 48.44.010, every health maintenance organization, as defined in RCW 48.46.020, or self-funded multiple employer welfare arrangement, as defined in RCW 48.125.010, registered to do business in this state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Health plan&quot; has the same meaning as defined in RCW 48.43.005.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Medicaid managed care organization&quot; means a managed health care system under contract with the state of Washington to provide services to medicaid enrollees under RCW 74.09.522.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Third-party administrator&quot; means any person or entity who, on behalf of an employer, an affiliated employer under common management and control, a multiple employer welfare arrangement, a Taft-Hartley benefit trust, or other health care purchaser, receives or collects charges, contributions, or premiums for, or adjusts or settles health services claims on or for, residents of Washington state. Third-party administrator does not include health care benefit managers as defined in RCW 48.200.020.

Registrants shall report a change of legal name, business name, business address, or business telephone number to the commissioner within 10 days after the change.</p>

<p>The commissioner shall define the data elements and procedures necessary to implement this section. To minimize administrative burdens on third-party administrators, in developing the data elements and procedures for registration and renewal, the commissioner may adopt the data elements and procedures adopted by the Washington vaccine association under RCW 70.290.075.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to chapter 48.04 RCW, if the commissioner finds that a third-party administrator has failed to register or to renew their registration, or has provided incorrect, misleading, incomplete, or materially untrue information to the commissioner, the commissioner may fine the third-party administrator up to $5,000 per violation and issue an order requiring the third-party administrator to remedy the violation of this section.</p>
