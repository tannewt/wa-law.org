Sec. 1481(a) (1)-(8) in any branch of the United States armed forces, United States reserve forces, or national guard;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The designated agent of the decedent as directed through a written document signed and dated by the decedent in the presence of a witness. The direction of the designated agent is sufficient to direct the type, place, and method of disposition;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The surviving spouse or state registered domestic partner;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The majority of the surviving adult children of the decedent;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>If a cemetery authority as defined in RCW 68.04.190 or a funeral establishment licensed under chapter 18.39 RCW has made a good faith effort to locate the person cited in subsection (3)(a) through (g) of this section or the legal representative of the decedent's estate, the cemetery authority or funeral establishment has the right to rely on an authority to bury or make final disposition of the human remains, executed by the most responsible party available, and the cemetery authority or funeral establishment may not be held criminally or civilly liable for burying or performing final disposition of the human remains. In the event any government agency or charitable organization provides the funds for the disposition of any human remains, the cemetery authority, alkaline hydrolysis, natural organic reduction facility, or funeral establishment may not be held criminally or civilly liable for making final disposition of the human remains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The liability for the reasonable cost of preparation, care, and disposition devolves jointly and severally upon all kin of the decedent in the same degree of kindred, in the order listed in subsection (3) of this section, and upon the estate of the decedent.</p>

It shall also determine which scoring probabilities are the highest for purposes of identification and shall submit such information to the coroner or medical examiner who prepared and forwarded the dental examination records. Once the dental identification system is established, operating funds shall come from the state general fund.</p>

<p>When a person reported missing has not been found within thirty days of the report, or at any time the investigating agency suspects criminal activity to be the basis of the victim being missing, the sheriff, chief of police, county coroner or county medical examiner, or other law enforcement authority initiating and conducting the investigation for the missing person shall: (1) File a missing person's report with the Washington state patrol missing and unidentified persons unit; (2) initiate the collection of DNA samples from the known missing person and their family members for nuclear and mitochondrial DNA testing along with the necessary consent forms; (3) ask the missing person's family or next of kin to give written consent to contact the dentist or dentists of the missing person and request the person's dental records; and (4) enter the case into the national crime information center system through the Washington state patrol electronic database.</p>
<p>The missing person's dentist or dentists shall provide diagnostic quality copies of the missing person's dental records or original dental records to the sheriff, chief of police, county coroner or county medical examiner, or other law enforcement authority, when presented with the written consent from the missing person's family or next of kin or with a statement from the sheriff, chief of police, county coroner or county medical examiner, or other law enforcement authority that the missing person's family or next of kin could not be located in the exercise of due diligence or that the missing person's family or next of kin refuse to consent to the release of the missing person's dental records and there is reason to believe that the missing person's family or next of kin may have been involved in the missing person's disappearance.</p>
<p>As soon as possible after collecting the DNA samples, the sheriff, chief of police, or other law enforcement authority shall submit the DNA samples to the appropriate laboratory. Dental records shall be submitted as soon as possible to the Washington state patrol missing and unidentified persons unit.</p>
<p>The descriptive information from missing person's reports and dental data submitted to the Washington state patrol missing and unidentified persons unit shall be recorded and maintained by the Washington state patrol missing and unidentified persons unit in the applicable dedicated missing person's databases.</p>
<p>When a person reported missing has been found, the sheriff, chief of police, coroner or medical examiner, or other law enforcement authority shall report such information to the Washington state patrol.</p>
<p>The dental identification system shall maintain a file of information regarding persons reported to it as missing. The file shall contain the information referred to in this section and such other information as the Washington state patrol finds relevant to assist in the location of a missing person.</p>
<p>The files of the dental identification system shall, upon request, be made available to law enforcement agencies attempting to locate missing persons.</p>

<p>If the county coroner or county medical examiner investigating a death is unable to establish the identity of a body or human remains by visual means, fingerprints, or other identifying data, he or she shall have a qualified dentist, as determined by the county coroner or county medical examiner, carry out a dental examination of the body or human remains. If the county coroner or county medical examiner with the aid of the dental examination and other identifying findings is still unable to establish the identity of the body or human remains, he or she shall prepare and forward such dental examination records within thirty days of the date the body or human remains were found to the dental identification system of the state patrol identification and criminal history section on forms supplied by the state patrol for such purposes.</p>
<p>The dental identification system shall act as a repository or computer center or both with respect to such dental examination records. It shall compare such dental examination records with dental records filed with it and shall determine which scoring probabilities are the highest for the purposes of identification. It shall then submit such information to the county coroner or county medical examiner who prepared and forwarded the dental examination records.</p>
<p>If the body or human remains are still unidentified thirty days after discovery, the county coroner or county medical examiner investigating the death must, as soon as practicable, submit information regarding the body or remains to the national missing and unidentified persons system created by the United States department of justice's national institute of justice. Information submitted to the national missing and unidentified persons system must include, to the extent information is available, a detailed personal description, DNA information, copies of fingerprints on standardized eight inch by eight inch fingerprint cards or the equivalent digital image, forensic dental examination records, and other identifying data, including date and place of death. If the identity of the body or human remains is later established, the county coroner or county medical examiner must notify the national missing and unidentified persons system within forty-eight hours.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>It is the duty of every person who knows of the existence and location of skeletal human remains to notify the coroner and local law enforcement in the most expeditious manner possible, unless such person has good reason to believe that such notice has already been given. Any person knowing of the existence of skeletal human remains and not having good reason to believe that the coroner and local law enforcement has notice thereof and who fails to give notice to the coroner and local law enforcement, is guilty of a misdemeanor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any person engaged in ground disturbing activity and who encounters or discovers skeletal human remains in or on the ground shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Immediately cease any activity which may cause further disturbance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a reasonable effort to protect the area from further disturbance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Report the presence and location of the remains to the coroner and local law enforcement in the most expeditious manner possible; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be held harmless from criminal and civil liability arising under the provisions of this section provided the following criteria are met:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The finding of the remains was based on inadvertent discovery;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The requirements of the subsection are otherwise met; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The person is otherwise in compliance with applicable law.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The coroner must make a determination of whether the skeletal human remains are forensic or nonforensic within five business days of receiving notification of a finding of such human remains provided that there is sufficient evidence to make such a determination within that time period. The coroner will retain jurisdiction over forensic remains.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Upon determination that the remains are nonforensic, the coroner must notify the department of archaeology and historic preservation within two business days. The department will have jurisdiction over such remains until provenance of the remains is established. A determination that remains are nonforensic does not create a presumption of removal or nonremoval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon receiving notice from a coroner of a finding of nonforensic skeletal human remains, the department must notify the appropriate local cemeteries, and all affected Indian tribes via certified mail to the head of the appropriate tribal government, and contact the appropriate tribal cultural resources staff within two business days of the finding. The determination of what are appropriate local cemeteries to be notified is at the discretion of the department. A notification to tribes of a finding of such nonforensic skeletal human remains does not create a presumption that the remains are Indian.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state physical anthropologist must make an initial determination of whether nonforensic skeletal human remains are Indian or non-Indian to the extent possible based on the remains within two business days of notification of a finding of nonforensic remains. If the remains are determined to be Indian, the department must notify all affected Indian tribes via certified mail to the head of the appropriate tribal government within two business days and contact the appropriate tribal cultural resources staff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The affected tribes have five business days to respond via telephone or writing to the department as to their interest in the remains.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Affected tribes&quot; are:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Those federally recognized tribes with usual and accustomed areas in the jurisdiction where the remains were found;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those federally recognized tribes that submit to the department maps that reflect the tribe's geographical area of cultural affiliation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other tribes with historical and cultural affiliation in the jurisdiction where the remains were found.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Forensic remains&quot; are those that come under the jurisdiction of the coroner pursuant to RCW 68.50.010.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Inadvertent discovery&quot; has the same meaning as used in RCW 27.44.040.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section constitutes, advocates, or otherwise grants, confers, or implies federal or state recognition of those tribes that are not federally recognized pursuant to 25 C.F.R. part 83, procedures for establishing that an American Indian group exists as an Indian tribe.</p>
