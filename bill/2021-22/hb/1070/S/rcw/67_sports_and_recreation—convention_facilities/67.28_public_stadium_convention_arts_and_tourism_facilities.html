<li>
<p>To carry out the purposes of this chapter including, but not limited to, financing loans or grants to nonprofit organizations or public housing authorities for affordable workforce housing within one-half mile of a transit station, the legislative body of any municipality has the power to issue revenue bonds without submitting the matter to the voters of the municipality and may pledge the special taxes provided for in this chapter to the repayment of such revenue bonds. However, the legislative body must create a special fund or funds for the sole purpose of paying the principal of and interest on the bonds of each such issue, into which fund or funds the legislative body may obligate the municipality to pay all or part of amounts collected from the special taxes provided for in this chapter, and/or to pay such amounts of the gross revenue of all or any part of the facilities constructed, acquired, improved, added to, repaired, or replaced pursuant to this chapter, as the legislative body determines. The principal of and interest on such bonds is payable only out of such special fund or funds, and the owners of such bonds must have a lien and charge against the gross revenue pledged to such fund.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The revenue bonds and the interest thereon issued against the fund or funds constitutes a claim of the owners thereof only as against such fund or funds and the revenue pledged therefor, and does not constitute a general indebtedness of the municipality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each revenue bond must state upon its face that it is payable from such special fund or funds, and all revenue bonds issued under this chapter are negotiable securities within the provisions of the law of this state. The revenue bonds may be registered either as to principal only or as to principal and interest as provided in RCW 39.46.030, or may be bearer bonds. The revenue bonds must be:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>In such denominations as the legislative body deems proper;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payable at such time or times and at such places, as determined by the legislative body;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Executed in such manner and bear interest at such rate or rates, as determined by the legislative body; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sold in such manner as the legislative body deems to be for the best interests of the municipality, either at public or private sale.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislative body may at the time of the issuance of the revenue bonds make covenants with the owners of such bonds as it may deem necessary to secure and guaranty the payment of the principal thereof and the interest thereon, including but not being limited to covenants to set aside adequate reserves to secure or guaranty the payment of such principal and interest, to pledge and apply thereto part or all of any lawfully authorized special taxes provided for in this chapter, to maintain rates, charges, or rentals sufficient with other available moneys to pay such principal and interest and to maintain adequate coverage over debt service, to appoint a trustee or trustees for the bond owners, to safeguard the expenditure of the proceeds of sale of such bonds and to fix the powers and duties of such trustee or trustees and to make such other covenants as the legislative body may deem necessary to accomplish the most advantageous sale of such bonds. For revenue bonds issued for the purpose of funding affordable workforce housing projects within one-half mile of a transit station, where such revenue bonds are reasonably expected to be awarded to projects that can expend the funds within three years after bond issuance, the legislative body must require that the aggregate debt service on all such outstanding revenue bonds be limited to no more than fifty percent of the revenue collected under RCW 67.28.180(3)(d)(ii), and that at least ten percent of the aggregate proceeds of all such outstanding revenue bonds be committed to finance one or more projects by an authority under chapter 43.167 RCW to promote sustainable workplace opportunities near a community impacted by the construction or operation of tourism-related facilities. The legislative body may also provide that revenue bonds payable out of the same source may later be issued on a parity with revenue bonds being issued and sold.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislative body may include in the principal amount of any such revenue bond issue an amount for engineering, architectural, planning, financial, legal, and other services and charges incident to the acquisition or construction of public stadium facilities, convention center facilities, performing arts center facilities, and/or visual arts center facilities, an amount to establish necessary reserves, an amount for working capital, and an amount necessary for interest during the period of construction of any facilities to be financed from the proceeds of such issue plus six months. The legislative body may, if it deems it in the best interest of the municipality, provide in any contract for the construction or acquisition of any facilities or additions or improvements thereto or replacements or extensions thereof that payment therefor may be made only in such revenue bonds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the municipality fails to carry out or perform any of its obligations or covenants made in the authorization, issuance, and sale of such bonds, the owner of any such bond may bring action against the municipality and compel the performance of any or all of such covenants.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, such bonds may be issued and sold in accordance with chapter 39.46 RCW.</p>

<p>Before proposing imposition of a new tax under this chapter, an increase in the rate of a tax imposed under this chapter, repeal of an exemption from a tax imposed under this chapter, or a change in the use of revenue received under this chapter, a municipality with a population of five thousand or more shall establish a lodging tax advisory committee under this section. A lodging tax advisory committee shall consist of at least five members, appointed by the legislative body of the municipality, unless the municipality has a charter providing for a different appointment authority. The committee membership shall include: (a) At least two members who are representatives of businesses required to collect tax under this chapter; and (b) at least two members who are persons involved in activities authorized to be funded by revenue received under this chapter. Persons who are eligible for appointment under (a) of this subsection are not eligible for appointment under (b) of this subsection. Persons who are eligible for appointment under (b) of this subsection are not eligible for appointment under (a) of this subsection. Organizations representing businesses required to collect tax under this chapter, organizations involved in activities authorized to be funded by revenue received under this chapter, and local agencies involved in tourism promotion may submit recommendations for membership on the committee. The number of members who are representatives of businesses required to collect tax under this chapter shall equal the number of members who are involved in activities authorized to be funded by revenue received under this chapter. One member shall be an elected official of the municipality who shall serve as chair of the committee. An advisory committee for a county may include one nonvoting member who is an elected official of a city or town in the county. An advisory committee for a city or town may include one nonvoting member who is an elected official of the county in which the city or town is located. The appointing authority shall review the membership of the advisory committee annually and make changes as appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any municipality that proposes imposition of a tax under this chapter, an increase in the rate of a tax imposed under this chapter, repeal of an exemption from a tax imposed under this chapter, or a change in the use of revenue received under this chapter shall submit the proposal to the lodging tax advisory committee for review and comment. The submission shall occur at least forty-five days before final action on or passage of the proposal by the municipality. The advisory committee shall submit comments on the proposal in a timely manner through generally applicable public comment procedures. The comments shall include an analysis of the extent to which the proposal will accommodate activities for tourists or increase tourism, and the extent to which the proposal will affect the long-term stability of the fund created under RCW 67.28.1815. Failure of the advisory committee to submit comments before final action on or passage of the proposal shall not prevent the municipality from acting on the proposal. A municipality is not required to submit an amended proposal to an advisory committee under this section.</p>
