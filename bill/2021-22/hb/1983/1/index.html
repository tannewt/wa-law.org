<p>In circumstances in which limitations must be placed on patient visitation due to a public health emergency or other threat to the health and safety of the patients and staff of a hospital, patients must still be allowed access to an essential support person, subject to reasonable limitations on such access tailored to protecting the health and safety of essential support persons, patients, and staff.</p>

<p>The hospital shall develop and implement reasonable conditions on access by an essential support person tailored to protecting the health and safety of the essential support person, patients, and staff, based upon the particular public health emergency or other health or safety threat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hospital may temporarily suspend an individual's designation as an essential support person for failure to comply with these requirements or reasonable conditions developed and implemented by the hospital that are tailored to protecting the health and safety of the essential support person, patient, and staff, based upon the particular public health emergency or other health or safety threat. Unless immediate action is necessary to prevent an imminent and serious threat to the health or safety of patients or staff, the hospital shall attempt to resolve the concerns with the essential support person and the patient prior to temporarily suspending the individual's designation as an essential support person.
