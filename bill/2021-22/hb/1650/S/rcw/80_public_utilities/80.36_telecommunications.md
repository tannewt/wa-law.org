## 80.36.110 - Tariff changes—Statutory notice—Exception—Waiver of provisions during state of emergency.
1. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, unless the commission otherwise orders, no change shall be made in any rate, toll, rental, or charge, that was filed and published by any telecommunications company in compliance with the requirements of RCW 80.36.100, except after notice as required in this subsection.

   a. For changes to any rate, toll, rental, or charge filed and published in a tariff, the company shall provide thirty days' notice to the commission and publication for thirty days as required in the case of original schedules in RCW 80.36.100. The notice shall plainly state the changes proposed to be made in the schedule then in force, and the time when the changed rate, toll, or charge will go into effect, and all proposed changes shall be shown by printing, filing and publishing new schedules, or shall be plainly indicated upon the schedules in force at the time and kept open to public inspection. Proposed changes may be suspended by the commission within thirty days or before the stated effective date of the proposed change, whichever is later.

   b. The commission for good cause shown may allow changes in rates, charges, tolls, or rentals without requiring the notice and publication provided for in (a) of this subsection, by an order or rule specifying the change to be made and the time when it takes effect, and the manner in which the change will be filed and published.

   c. When any change is made in any rate, toll, rental, or charge, the effect of which is to increase any rate, toll, rental, or charge then existing, attention shall be directed on the copy filed with the commission to the increase by some character immediately preceding or following the item in the schedule, which character shall be in such a form as the commission may designate.

2. [Empty]

   a. A telecommunications company may file a tariff that decreases any rate, charge, rental, or toll with ten days' notice to the commission and publication without receiving a special order from the commission when the filing does not contain an offsetting increase to another rate, charge, rental, or toll, and the filing company agrees not to file for an increase to any rate, charge, rental, or toll to recover the revenue deficit that results from the decrease for a period of one year.

   b. A telecommunications company may file a promotional offering to be effective, without receiving a special order from the commission, upon filing with the commission and publication. For the purposes of this section, "promotional offering" means a tariff that, for a period of up to ninety days, waives or reduces charges or conditions of service for existing or new subscribers for the purpose of retaining or increasing the number of customers who subscribe to or use a service.

[(3)] During a state of emergency declared under RCW 43.06.010(12), the governor may waive or suspend the operation or enforcement of this section or any portion of this section or under any administrative rule, and issue any orders to facilitate the operation of state or local government or to promote and secure the safety and protection of the civilian population.

## 80.36.130 - Published rates to be charged—Exceptions.
1. Except as provided in RCW 80.04.130 and 80.36.150, no telecommunications company shall charge, demand, collect or receive different compensation for any service rendered or to be rendered than the charge applicable to such service as specified in its schedule on file and in effect at that time, nor shall any telecommunications company refund or remit, directly or indirectly, any portion of the rate or charge so specified, nor extend to any person or corporation any form of contract or agreement or any rule or regulation or any privilege or facility except such as are specified in its schedule filed and in effect at the time, and regularly and uniformly extended to all persons and corporations under like circumstances for like or substantially similar service.

2. No telecommunications company subject to the provisions of this title shall, directly or indirectly, give any free or reduced service or any free pass or frank for the transmission of messages by telecommunications between points within this state, except to its officers, employees, agents, pensioners, surgeons, physicians, attorneys-at-law, and their families, and persons and corporations exclusively engaged in charitable and eleemosynary work, and ministers of religion, Young Men's Christian Associations, Young Women's Christian Associations; to indigent and destitute persons, and to officers and employees of other telecommunications companies, railroad companies, and street railroad companies.

## 80.36.135 - Alternative regulation of telecommunications companies—Waiver of provisions during state of emergency.
1. The legislature declares that:

   a. Changes in technology and the structure of the telecommunications industry may produce conditions under which traditional rate of return, rate base regulation of telecommunications companies may not in all cases provide the most efficient and effective means of achieving the public policy goals of this state as declared in RCW 80.36.300, this section, and RCW 80.36.145. The commission should be authorized to employ an alternative form of regulation if that alternative is better suited to achieving those policy goals.

   b. Because of the great diversity in the scope and type of services provided by telecommunications companies, alternative regulatory arrangements that meet the varying circumstances of different companies and their ratepayers may be desirable.

2. Subject to the conditions set forth in this chapter and RCW 80.04.130, the commission may regulate telecommunications companies subject to traditional rate of return, rate base regulation by authorizing an alternative form of regulation. The commission may determine the manner and extent of any alternative forms of regulation as may in the public interest be appropriate. In addition to the public policy goals declared in RCW 80.36.300, the commission shall consider, in determining the appropriateness of any proposed alternative form of regulation, whether it will:

   a. Facilitate the broad deployment of technological improvements and advanced telecommunications services to underserved areas or underserved customer classes;

   b. Improve the efficiency of the regulatory process;

   c. Preserve or enhance the development of effective competition and protect against the exercise of market power during its development;

   d. Preserve or enhance service quality and protect against the degradation of the quality or availability of efficient telecommunications services;

   e. Provide for rates and charges that are fair, just, reasonable, sufficient, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential; and

   f. Not unduly or unreasonably prejudice or disadvantage any particular customer class.

3. A telecommunications company or companies subject to traditional rate of return, rate base regulation may petition the commission to establish an alternative form of regulation. The company or companies shall submit with the petition a plan for an alternative form of regulation. The plan shall contain a proposal for transition to the alternative form of regulation and the proposed duration of the plan. The plan must also contain a proposal for ensuring adequate carrier-to-carrier service quality, including service quality standards or performance measures for interconnection, and appropriate enforcement or remedial provisions in the event the company fails to meet service quality standards or performance measures. The commission also may initiate consideration of alternative forms of regulation for a company or companies on its own motion. The commission, after notice and hearing, shall issue an order accepting, modifying, or rejecting the plan within nine months after the petition or motion is filed, unless extended by the commission for good cause. The commission shall order implementation of the alternative plan of regulation unless it finds that, on balance, an alternative plan as proposed or modified fails to meet the considerations stated in subsection (2) of this section.

4. Not later than sixty days from the entry of the commission's order, the company or companies affected by the order may file with the commission an election not to proceed with the alternative form of regulation as authorized by the commission.

5. The commission may waive such regulatory requirements under Title 80 RCW for a telecommunications company subject to an alternative form of regulation as may be appropriate to facilitate the implementation of this section. However, the commission may not waive any grant of legal rights to any person contained in this chapter and chapter 80.04 RCW. The commission may waive different regulatory requirements for different companies or services if such different treatment is in the public interest.

6. Upon petition by the company, and after notice and hearing, the commission may rescind or modify an alternative form of regulation in the manner requested by the company.

7. The commission or any person may file a complaint under RCW 80.04.110 alleging that a telecommunications company under an alternative form of regulation has not complied with the terms and conditions set forth in the alternative form of regulation. The complainant shall bear the burden of proving the allegations in the complaint.

8. During a state of emergency declared under RCW 43.06.010(12), the governor may waive or suspend the operation or enforcement of this section or any portion of this section or under any administrative rule, and issue any orders to facilitate the operation of state or local government or to promote and secure the safety and protection of the civilian population.

## 80.36.140 - Rates and services fixed by commission, when.
Whenever the commission shall find, after a hearing had upon its own motion or upon complaint, that the rates, charges, tolls or rentals demanded, exacted, charged or collected by any telecommunications company for the transmission of messages by telecommunications, or for the rental or use of any telecommunications line, instrument, wire, appliance, apparatus or device or any telecommunications receiver, transmitter, instrument, wire, cable, apparatus, conduit, machine, appliance or device, or any telecommunications extension or extension system, or that the rules, regulations or practices of any telecommunications company affecting such rates, charges, tolls, rentals or service are unjust, unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory or unduly preferential, or in anywise in violation of law, or that such rates, charges, tolls or rentals are insufficient to yield reasonable compensation for the service rendered, the commission shall determine the just and reasonable rates, charges, tolls or rentals to be thereafter observed and in force, and fix the same by order as provided in this title.

Whenever the commission shall find, after such hearing that the rules, regulations or practices of any telecommunications company are unjust or unreasonable, or that the equipment, facilities or service of any telecommunications company is inadequate, inefficient, improper or insufficient, the commission shall determine the just, reasonable, proper, adequate and efficient rules, regulations, practices, equipment, facilities and service to be thereafter installed, observed and used, and fix the same by order or rule as provided in this title.

## 80.36.145 - Formal investigation and fact-finding—Alternative to full adjudicative proceeding—Waiver of provisions during state of emergency.
1. The legislature declares that the availability of an alternative abbreviated formal procedure for use by the commission instead of a full adjudicative proceeding may in appropriate circumstances advance the public interest by reducing the time required by the commission for decision and the costs incurred by interested parties and ratepayers. Therefore, the commission is authorized to use formal investigation and fact-finding instead of an adjudicative proceeding under chapter 34.05 RCW when it determines that its use is in the public interest and that a full adjudicative hearing is not necessary to fully develop the facts relevant to the proceeding and the positions of the parties, including intervenors.

2. The commission may use formal investigation and fact-finding instead of the hearing provided in the following circumstances:

   a. A complaint proceeding under RCW 80.04.110 with concurrence of the respondent when the commission is the complainant or with concurrence of the complainant and respondent when not the commission;

   b. A tariff suspension under RCW 80.04.130; or

   c. A competitive classification proceeding under RCW 80.36.320 and 80.36.330.

3. In formal investigation and fact-finding the commission may limit the record to written submissions by the parties, including intervenors. The commission shall review the written submissions and, based thereon, shall enter appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law and its order. When there is a reasonable expression of public interest in the issues under consideration, the commission shall hold at least one public hearing for the receipt of information from members of the public that are not formal intervenors in the proceeding and may elect to convert the proceeding to an adjudicative proceeding at any stage. The assignment of an agency employee or administrative law judge to preside at such public hearing shall not require the entry of an initial order.

4. The commission shall adopt rules of practice and procedure including rules for discovery of information necessary for the use of formal investigation and fact-finding and for the filing of written submissions. The commission may provide by rule for a number of rounds of written comments: PROVIDED, That the party with the burden of proof shall always have the opportunity to file reply comments.

5. During a state of emergency declared under RCW 43.06.010(12), the governor may waive or suspend the operation or enforcement of this section or any portion of this section or under any administrative rule, and issue any orders to facilitate the operation of state or local government or to promote and secure the safety and protection of the civilian population.

\[ [2008 c 181 § 407](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2007-08/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6950.SL.pdf?cite=2008%20c%20181%20§%20407); [1989 c 101 § 3](http://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1989c101.pdf?cite=1989%20c%20101%20§%203); \]

## 80.36.150 - Contracts filed with commission.
1. Every telecommunications company shall file with the commission, as and when required by it, a copy of any contract, agreement or arrangement in writing with any other telecommunications company, or with any other corporation, association or person relating in any way to the construction, maintenance or use of a telecommunications line or service by, or rates and charges over and upon, any such telecommunications line. The commission shall adopt rules that provide for the filing by telecommunications companies on the public record of the essential terms and conditions of every contract for service. The commission shall not require that customer proprietary information contained in contracts be disclosed on the public record.

2. The commission shall not treat contracts as tariffs or price lists. The commission may require noncompetitive service to be tariffed unless the company demonstrates that the use of a contract is in the public interest based upon a customer requirement or a competitive necessity for deviation from tariffed rates, terms and conditions, or that the contract is for a new service with limited demand.

3. Contracts shall be for a stated time period and shall cover the costs for the service contracted for, as determined by commission rule or order. Contracts shall be enforceable by the contracting parties according to their terms, unless the contract has been rejected by the commission before its stated effective date as improper under the commission's rules and orders, or the requirements of this chapter. If the commission finds a contract to be below cost after it has gone into effect, based on commission rules or orders or the requirements of this chapter in effect at the time of the execution of the contract, it may make the appropriate adjustment to the contracting company's revenue requirement in a subsequent proceeding.

4. Contracts executed and filed prior to July 23, 1989, are deemed lawful and enforceable by the contracting parties according to the contract terms. If the commission finds that any existing contract provides for rates that are below cost, based on commission rules or orders or the requirements of this chapter in effect at the time of the execution of the contract, it may make the appropriate adjustment to the contracting company's revenue requirement in a subsequent proceeding.

5. If a contract covers competitive and noncompetitive services, the noncompetitive services shall be unbundled and priced separately from all other services and facilities in the contract. Such noncompetitive services shall be made available to all purchasers under the same or substantially the same circumstances at the same rate, terms, and conditions.

## 80.36.160 - Physical connections may be ordered, routing prescribed, and joint rates established.
In order to provide toll telephone service where no such service is available, or to promote the most expeditious handling or most direct routing of toll messages and conversations, or to prevent arbitrary or unreasonable practices which may result in the failure to utilize the toll facilities of all telecommunications companies equitably and effectively, the commission may, on its own motion, or upon complaint, notwithstanding any contract or arrangement between telecommunications companies, investigate, ascertain and, after hearing, by order (1) require the construction and maintenance of suitable connections between telephone lines for the transfer of messages and conversations at a common point or points and, if the companies affected fail to agree on the proportion of the cost thereof to be borne by each such company, prescribe said proportion of cost to be borne by each; and/or (2) prescribe the routing of toll messages and conversations over such connections and the practices and regulations to be followed with respect to such routing; and/or (3) establish reasonable joint rates or charges by or over said lines and connections and just, reasonable and equitable divisions thereof as between the telecommunications companies participating therein.

This section shall not be construed as conferring on the commission jurisdiction, supervision or control of the rates, service or facilities of any mutual, cooperative or farmer line company or association, except for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this section.

In determining whether a company is competitive, factors the commission shall consider include but are not limited to:

   a. The number and sizes of alternative providers of service;

   b. The extent to which services are available from alternative providers in the relevant market;

   c. The ability of alternative providers to make functionally equivalent or substitute services readily available at competitive rates, terms, and conditions; and

   d. Other indicators of market power which may include market share, growth in market share, ease of entry, and the affiliation of providers of services.

The commission shall conduct the initial classification and any subsequent review of the classification in accordance with such procedures as the commission may establish by rule.

2. Competitive telecommunications companies shall be subject to minimal regulation. The commission may waive any regulatory requirement under this title for competitive telecommunications companies when it determines that competition will serve the same purposes as public interest regulation. The commission may waive different regulatory requirements for different companies if such different treatment is in the public interest. A competitive telecommunications company shall at a minimum:

   a. Keep its accounts according to regulations as determined by the commission;

   b. File financial reports with the commission as required by the commission and in a form and at times prescribed by the commission; and

   c. Cooperate with commission investigations of customer complaints.

3. The commission may revoke any waivers it grants and may reclassify any competitive telecommunications company if the revocation or reclassification would protect the public interest.

4. The commission may waive the requirements of RCW 80.36.170 and 80.36.180 in whole or in part for a competitive telecommunications company if it finds that competition will serve the same purpose and protect the public interest.

1. The legislature finds that universal telephone service is an important policy goal of the state. The legislature further finds that: (a) Recent changes in the telecommunications industry, such as federal access charges, raise concerns about the ability of low-income persons to continue to afford access to local exchange telephone service; and (b) many low-income persons making the transition to independence from receiving supportive services through community agencies do not qualify for economic assistance from the department.

2. Therefore, the legislature finds that: (a) It is in the public interest to take steps to mitigate the effects of these changes on low-income persons; and (b) advances in telecommunications technologies, such as community service voice mail provide new and economically efficient ways to secure many of the benefits of universal service to low-income persons who are not customers of local exchange telephone service.

## 80.36.850 - Extended area service defined.
As used in RCW 80.36.855, "extended area service" means the ability to call from one exchange to another exchange without incurring a toll charge.

\[ [1989 c 282 § 2](http://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1989c282.pdf?cite=1989%20c%20282%20§%202); \]

## 80.36.855 - Extended area service program.
Any business, resident, or community may petition for and shall receive extended area service within the service territory of the local exchange company that provides service to the petitioner under the following conditions:

1. Any customer, business or residential, interested in obtaining extended area service in their community must collect and submit to the commission the signatures of a representative majority of affected customers in the community. A "representative majority" for purposes of this section consists of fifteen percent of the access lines in that community;

2. After receipt of the signatures, the commission shall authorize a study to be conducted by the affected local exchange company in order to determine whether a community of interest exists for the implementation of extended area service. For purposes of this section a community of interest shall be found if the average number of calls per customer per month from the area petitioning for extended area service to the area to which extended area service will be implemented is at least five;

3. If a community of interest exists, the commission shall then calculate any increased rate that would be applied to the area which would have extended area service granted to it. This rate shall be based on the charges to a rate group having the same or similar calling capability as set forth in the tariffs of the local exchange telecommunications company involved;

4. The affected telecommunications company shall be given the opportunity to propose an alternative plan that might be priced differently and that plan shall be included in the poll of subscribers as an alternative under subsection (5) of this section;

5. After determining the amount of any additional rate, the commission shall notify the subscribers who will be affected by the increased rate and conduct a poll of those subscribers. If a simple majority votes its approval the commission shall order extended area service; and

6. Any extended area service program adopted pursuant to this section shall be considered experimental and not binding on the commission in subsequent extended area service proceedings. If an extended area service program adopted pursuant to this section results in a revenue deficiency for a local exchange company, the commission shall allocate the resulting revenue requirement in a manner which produces fair, just and reasonable rates for all classes of customers.
