# House Bill 2034

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/House%20Bills/2034.xml)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that:

1. Since the creation of Washington state's juvenile courts, individuals adjudicated of juvenile offenses have received differing degrees of legal protections related to their juvenile records.

2. As legal protections for juvenile records expanded and contracted under different Washington legislatures, juvenile records and information related to those records have been disseminated in ways that hinder individuals adjudicated of juvenile offenses from effective reintegration and harm those individuals whose protected information has been shared without recourse or accountability.

3. To remedy barriers created by the release of juvenile records and information related to those records, the legislature intends to emphasize that former individuals adjudicated of juvenile offenses can seek relief for harm caused by violations of this chapter and grant individuals the right to monetary damages for violations of this chapter.

4. To provide Washington youth with the finality necessary to effectively protect their records, the legislature further intends to create a process that allows rehabilitated former individuals adjudicated of juvenile offenses the right to destroy juvenile records and information related to those records.

The juvenile respondent's presence is not required at any administrative sealing hearing.

    b. At **a juvenile** disposition hearing , the court shall schedule an administrative sealing hearing to take place during the first regularly scheduled sealing hearing after the latest of the following events that apply:

In determining whether the respondent is on supervision or owes restitution, the court shall take judicial notice of court records, including records of the county clerk, and, if necessary, sworn testimony from a representative of the juvenile department.

    e. At the time of the administrative sealing hearing, if the court finds the respondent remains on supervision for the case being considered for sealing, then the court shall continue the administrative sealing hearing to a date within **30** days following the anticipated end date of the respondent's supervision.

At any time following entry of the written order denying the request to seal a juvenile court record, the respondent may contact the juvenile court department, provide proof of payment of the remaining unpaid restitution to the original victim, excluding any public or private entity providing insurance coverage or health care coverage, and request an administrative sealing hearing. Upon verification of the satisfaction of the restitution payment, the juvenile court department staff shall circulate for signature an order sealing the file, and file the signed order with the clerk's office, who shall seal the record.

        iv. The administrative office of the courts must ensure that sealed juvenile records remain private in case of an appeal and are either not posted or redacted from any clerks papers that are posted online with the appellate record, as well as taking any other prudent steps necessary to avoid exposing sealed juvenile records to the public.
