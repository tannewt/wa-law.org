> This section modifies existing section [17.10.235](/rcw/17_weeds_rodents_and_pests/17.10_noxious_weeds—control_boards.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/17_weeds_rodents_and_pests/17.10_noxious_weeds—control_boards.md) for context.

1. The director of agriculture shall adopt, with the advice of the state noxious weed control board, rules designating noxious weed seeds which shall be controlled in products, screenings, or articles to prevent the spread of noxious weeds. The rules shall identify the products, screenings, and articles in which the seeds must be controlled and the maximum amount of the seed to be permitted in the product, screenings, or article to avoid a hazard of spreading the noxious weed by seed from the product, screenings, or article. The director shall also adopt, with the advice of the state board, rules designating toxic weeds which shall be controlled in feed stuffs and screenings to prevent injury to the animal that consumes the feed. The rules shall identify the feed stuffs and screenings in which the toxic weeds must be controlled and the maximum amount of the toxic weed to be permitted in the feed. Rules developed under this section shall identify ways that products, screenings, articles, or feed stuffs containing noxious weed seeds or toxic weeds can be made available for beneficial uses.

2. Any person who knowingly or negligently sells or otherwise distributes a product, article, screenings, or feed stuff designated by rule containing noxious weed seeds or toxic weeds designated for control by rule and in an amount greater than the amount established by the director for the seed or weed by rule is guilty of a misdemeanor.

3. The department of agriculture shall, upon request of the buyer, **county weed board, or weed district,** inspect products, screenings, articles, or feed stuffs designated by rule and charge fees, in accordance with chapter 22.09 RCW, to determine the presence of designated noxious weed seeds or toxic weeds.


## Section 12
> This section modifies existing section [17.10.240](/rcw/17_weeds_rodents_and_pests/17.10_noxious_weeds—control_boards.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/17_weeds_rodents_and_pests/17.10_noxious_weeds—control_boards.md) for context.

1. The activated county noxious weed control board of each county shall annually submit a budget to the county legislative authority for the operating cost of the county's weed program for the ensuing fiscal year: PROVIDED, That if the board finds the budget approved by the legislative authority is insufficient for an effective county noxious weed control program **, the board may submit a budget amendment to the county legislative authority after which the county legislative authority must hold a hearing as provided in chapter 36.40 RCW**.

**Activities and programs to limit economic loss and adverse effects due to the presence and spread of noxious weeds on all terrestrial and aquatic areas in the state are declared to be of special benefit, including to lands owned or held by the state, and may be used as the basis upon which special assessments are imposed by the county legislative authority.**

Funding for the budget is derived from any or all of the following: (a) The county legislative authority may, in lieu of a tax, levy an assessment against the land for this purpose. **Whenever there is included within the jurisdiction of any weed control board lands owned or held by the state, the county legislative authority shall determine the amount of the tax or assessment for which the land would be liable if the land were in private ownership. Taxes or assessments, as appropriate, on lands owned or held by the state must be presented to the appropriate state agency and must be paid by the appropriate state agency, according to the process set forth in chapter 79.44 RCW.**

Prior to the levying of an assessment the county noxious weed control board shall hold a public hearing at which it will gather information to serve as a basis for classification and then classify the lands into suitable classifications, including but not limited to dry lands, range lands, irrigated lands, nonuse lands, forestlands, or federal lands. The board shall develop and forward to the county legislative authority, as a proposed level of assessment for each class, an amount as seems just. The assessment rate shall be either uniform per acre in its respective class or a flat rate per parcel rate plus a uniform rate per acre**or, for rights-of-way, a rate based on centerline miles**. The county legislative authority, upon receipt of the proposed levels of assessment from the board, after a hearing, shall accept or modify by resolution, or refer back to the board for its reconsideration all or any portion of the proposed levels of assessment. The amount of the assessment constitutes a lien against the property. The county legislative authority may by resolution or ordinance require that notice of the lien be sent to each owner of property for which the assessment has not been paid by the date it was due and that each lien created be collected by the treasurer in the same manner as delinquent real property tax, if within thirty days from the date the owner is sent notice of the lien, including the amount thereof, the lien remains unpaid and an appeal has not been made pursuant to RCW 17.10.180. Liens treated as delinquent taxes bear interest at the rate of twelve percent per annum and the interest accrues as of the date notice of the lien is sent to the owner: PROVIDED FURTHER, That any collections for the lien shall not be considered as tax; or

    b. The county legislative authority may appropriate money from the county general fund necessary for the administration of the county noxious weed control program. In addition the county legislative authority may make emergency appropriations as it deems necessary for the implementation of this chapter.

2. Forestlands used solely for the planting, growing, or harvesting of trees and which are typified, except during a single period of five years following clear-cut logging, by canopies so dense as to prohibit growth of an understory may be subject to an annual noxious weed assessment levied by a county legislative authority that does not exceed one-tenth of the weighted average per acre noxious weed assessment levied on all other lands in unincorporated areas within the county that are subject to the weed assessment. This assessment shall be computed in accordance with the formula in subsection (3) of this section.

3. The calculation of the "weighted average per acre noxious weed assessment" is a ratio expressed as follows:

    a. The numerator is the total amount of funds estimated to be collected from the per acre assessment on all lands except (i) forestlands as identified in subsection (2) of this section, (ii) lands exempt from the noxious weed assessment, and (iii) lands located in an incorporated area.

    b. The denominator is the total acreage from which funds in (a) of this subsection are collected. For lands of less than one acre in size, the denominator calculation may be based on the following assumptions: (i) Unimproved lands are calculated as being one-half acre in size on the average, and (ii) improved lands are calculated as being one-third acre in size on the average. The county legislative authority may choose to calculate the denominator for lands of less than one acre in size using other assumptions about average parcel size based on local information.

4. For those counties that levy a per parcel assessment to help fund noxious weed control programs, the per parcel assessment on forestlands as defined in subsection (2) of this section shall not exceed one-tenth of the per parcel assessment on nonforestlands.

**A county noxious weed control board may be deactivated only if there are neither any class A noxious weeds nor any class B noxious weeds in the county. Upon receiving documentation of the absence in the county of both class A noxious weeds and class B noxious weeds, the county legislative authority may initiate the following procedures**:

1. The county legislative authority holds a hearing to determine whether there continues to be a need for an activated county noxious weed control board if:

    a. A petition is filed by one hundred registered voters within the county;

    b. A petition is filed by a county noxious weed control board as provided in RCW 17.10.240; or

    c. The county legislative authority passes a motion to hold such a hearing.

2. Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, the hearing shall be held within sixty days of final action taken under subsection (1) of this section.

3. If, after a hearing, the county legislative authority determines that no need exists for a county noxious weed control board, due to the absence of class A or class B noxious weeds designated for control in the region, the county legislative authority shall deactivate the board.

4. The county legislative authority shall not convene a hearing as provided for in subsection (1) of this section more frequently than once a year.
