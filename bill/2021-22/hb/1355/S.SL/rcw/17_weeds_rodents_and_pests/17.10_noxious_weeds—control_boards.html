<p>There is created a state noxious weed control board comprised of nine voting members and <strong>four</strong> nonvoting members. Four of the voting members shall be elected by the members of the various activated county noxious weed control boards, and shall be residents of a county in which a county noxious weed control board has been activated and a member of said board, and those qualifications shall continue through their term of office. Two of these members shall be elected from the west side of the state, the crest of the Cascades being the dividing line, and two from the east side of the state. The director of agriculture is a voting member of the board. One voting member shall be elected by the directors of the various active weed districts formed under chapter 17.04 or 17.06 RCW. The Washington state association of counties appoints one voting member who shall be a member of a county legislative authority. <strong>A statewide association representing county noxious weed coordinators appoints a nonvoting technical advisor.</strong> The director shall appoint two voting members to represent the public interest, one from the west side and one from the east side of the state. The director shall also appoint three nonvoting members representing scientific disciplines relating to weed control. The term of office for all members of the board is <strong>four</strong> years from the date of election or appointment.</p>
<p>The board, by rule, shall establish a position number for each elected position of the board and shall designate which county noxious weed control board members are eligible to vote for each elected position. The elected members serve staggered terms. Elections for the elected members of the board shall be held thirty days prior to the expiration date of their respective terms. Nominations and elections shall be by mail and conducted by the board.</p>
<p>The board shall conduct its first meeting within thirty days after all its members have been elected. The board shall elect from its members a chair and other officers as may be necessary. A majority of the voting members of the board constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business and is necessary for any action taken by the board. The members of the board serve without salary, but shall be reimbursed for travel expenses incurred in the performance of their duties under this chapter in accordance with RCW 43.03.050 and 43.03.060.</p>

<p>An inactive county noxious weed control board may be activated by any one of the following methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Either within sixty days after a petition is filed by one hundred registered voters within the county or, on its own motion, the county legislative authority shall hold a hearing to determine whether there is a need, due to a damaging infestation of noxious weeds, to activate the county noxious weed control board. If such a need is found to exist, then the county legislative authority shall, in the manner provided by RCW 17.10.050, appoint five persons to the county's noxious weed control board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the county's noxious weed control board is not activated within one year following a hearing by the county legislative authority to determine the need for activation, then upon the filing with the state noxious weed control board of a petition comprised either of the signatures of at least two hundred registered voters within the county, or of the signatures of a majority of an adjacent county's noxious weed control board, the state board shall, within six months of the date of the filing, hold a hearing in the county to determine the need for activation. If a need for activation is found to exist, then the state board shall order the county legislative authority to activate the county's noxious weed control board and to appoint members to the board in the manner provided by RCW 17.10.050.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director, upon request of the state noxious weed control board, shall order a county legislative authority to activate the noxious weed control board immediately if an infestation of a class A noxious weed or class B noxious weed designated for control on the state noxious weed list is confirmed in that county. The county legislative authority may, as an alternative to activating the noxious weed board, combat the class A noxious weed or class B noxious weed with county resources and personnel operating with the authorities and responsibilities imposed by this chapter on a county noxious weed control board. No county may continue without a noxious weed control board for a second consecutive year if the class A noxious weed or class B noxious weed has not been eradicated.</p>

If seed or other propagule dispersion is imminent, immediate control action may be taken forty-eight hours following the time that notification is reasonably expected to have been received by the owner or agent by certified mail or personal service, instead of ten days. If a landowner received a notice of violation from the county noxious weed control board in a prior growing season, removal or destruction of all above ground plant parts may be required at the most effective point in the growing season, as determined by the county weed board, which may be before or after propagule dispersion.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>If the owner does not take action to control the noxious weeds in accordance with the notice, the county board may control them, or cause their being controlled, at the expense of the owner. The amount of the expense constitutes a lien against the property and may be enforced by proceedings on the lien except as provided for by RCW 79.44.060. The owner is liable for payment of the expense, and nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent collection of any judgment on account thereof by any means available pursuant to law, in substitution for enforcement of the lien. Necessary costs and expenses including reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the county noxious weed control board in carrying out this section may be recovered at the same time as a part of the action filed under this section. Funds received in payment for the expense of controlling noxious weeds shall be transferred to the county noxious weed control board to be expended as required to carry out the purposes of this chapter.</p>

<li>
<p>The county auditor shall record in his or her office any lien created under this chapter, and any lien shall bear interest at the rate of twelve percent per annum from the date on which the county noxious weed control board approves the amount expended in controlling the weeds.</p>

<p>As an alternative to the enforcement of any lien created under subsection (3) of this section, the county legislative authority may by resolution or ordinance require that each lien created be collected by the treasurer in the same manner as a delinquent real property tax, if within thirty days from the date the owner is sent notice of the lien, including the amount thereof, the lien remains unpaid and an appeal has not been made pursuant to RCW 17.10.180. Liens treated as delinquent taxes bear interest at the rate of twelve percent per annum and the interest accrues as of the date notice of the lien is sent to the owner: PROVIDED, That any collections for the lien shall not be considered as tax.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The denominator is the total acreage from which funds in (a) of this subsection are collected. For lands of less than one acre in size, the denominator calculation may be based on the following assumptions: (i) Unimproved lands are calculated as being one-half acre in size on the average, and (ii) improved lands are calculated as being one-third acre in size on the average.
