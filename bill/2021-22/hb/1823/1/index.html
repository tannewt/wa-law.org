<p>The legislature intends for the revenue from the climate commitment act to fund outdoor recreation and climate adaptation. Climate change impacts in Washington state are forecast to include an increasing number of hotter days, reduced snowpack, higher winter streamflows, lower summer streamflows, and sea level rise. The results will include more flooding, more drought, and more wildfire risk. The results will also include fewer outdoor recreation opportunities. In 2021 alone, all public lands east of the Cascade mountains were closed for two months to public recreation use due to extreme fire danger. These impacts are occurring and will continue to occur because of previous greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The realities in the global economy indicate continued growth in manufacturing and energy demand in both China and India. Their populations dwarf ours in Washington and their energy grids are largely dependent on fossil fuels. Today, China is responsible for 27 percent of all global emissions. Importantly, Washington's emissions footprint is only .01 percent of China's emissions. A recently published study by researchers at the University of Washington found that even if all countries meet their promises under the Paris agreement and continue to reduce emissions at the same rate thereafter, it is unlikely that warming would stay under 2 degrees Celsius. In short, even if Washington state eliminated our greenhouse gas emissions immediately, we will experience climate change impacts.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature considers it to be in the long-term interest of Washington residents to focus available resources from the carbon emission allowance auctions that will occur under the cap-and-trade program toward practical environmental stewardship and enhanced and more equitable outdoor recreation opportunity. In 2009, the legislature formally recognized the need to prepare for a changing climate and directed state agencies to develop an integrated climate response strategy to recommend to the legislature (section 10, chapter 519, Laws of 2009). To a great extent, those recommended strategies can be consolidated and organized into programs to benefit climate adaptation and outdoor recreation. The legislature now resolves to reprioritize the climate commitment act revenue toward those purposes.</p>

<p>It is the intent of the legislature that each year the total investments made through the <strong>outdoor recreation and climate adaptation</strong> account created in RCW 70A.65.240,  the natural climate solutions account created in RCW 70A.65.270, and the air quality and health disparities improvement account created in RCW 70A.65.280, achieve the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A minimum of not less than 35 percent and a goal of 40 percent of total investments that provide direct and meaningful benefits to vulnerable populations within the boundaries of overburdened communities identified under chapter 314, Laws of 2021; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the requirements of (a) of this subsection, a minimum of not less than 10 percent of total investments that are used for programs, activities, or projects formally supported by a resolution of an Indian tribe, with priority given to otherwise qualifying projects directly administered or proposed by an Indian tribe. An investment that meets the requirements of both this subsection (1)(b) and (a) of this subsection may count toward the minimum percentage targets for both subsections.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The expenditure of moneys under this chapter must be consistent with applicable federal, state, and local laws, and treaty rights including, but not limited to, prohibitions on uses of funds imposed by the state Constitution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;benefits&quot; means investments or activities that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Reduce vulnerable population characteristics, environmental burdens, or associated risks that contribute significantly to the cumulative impact designation of highly impacted communities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meaningfully protect an overburdened community from, or support community response to, the impacts of air pollution or climate change; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meet a community need identified by vulnerable members of the community that is consistent with the intent of this chapter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state must develop a process by which to evaluate the impacts of the investments made under this chapter, work across state agencies to develop and track priorities across the different eligible funding categories, and work with the environmental justice council pursuant to RCW 70A.65.040.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No expenditures may be made from the <strong>outdoor recreation and climate adaptation</strong> account created in RCW 70A.65.240, the climate investment account created in RCW 70A.65.250, or the air quality and health disparities improvement account created in RCW 70A.65.280 if, by April 1, 2023, the legislature has not considered and enacted request legislation brought forth by the department under RCW 70A.65.060 that outlines a compliance pathway specific to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed businesses for achieving their proportionate share of the state's emissions reduction limits through 2050.</p>
