<h2 id="section-1-3078">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-3078">¶</a></h2>
<p>In 2021, the legislature repealed the statute that exempted agricultural workers from overtime pay which had been in effect since 1959. With this historic legislation, Washington state became the first state in the nation to impose an overtime pay requirement for agricultural workers working in excess of 40 hours a week. Recognizing that such a change would be a sizeable shift in practice for all farmers and agricultural workers across the state, the legislature adopted a phased-in approach, but did not address the seasonal needs of Washington agriculture given the time-sensitive nature of growing and harvesting mature field crops and perishable fruits and vegetables. The agricultural industry is unique from other types of industry because of pressures on farmers, ranchers, and workers caused by issues mainly out of their control such as uncertainty of weather, yields, calving, national and international shifts in trade policy, and transportation inconsistencies. Furthermore, farmers do not set their own prices and are price takers who cannot simply respond to increased production costs by increasing prices of their goods. Due to the tight margins that farms operate on, farm employers may be forced to limit overtime work, resulting in the full harvest not being collected and the worker being denied the opportunity to earn the wages for which they have become accustomed. The legislature believes it is reasonable to allow agricultural employers limited flexibility to shape work schedules during a narrow window of time to best fit the peaks of labor demand for their crops, thereby providing them some ability to weather the unpredictability of agricultural work and ensure that Washington's second largest industry remains vital and strong while also ensuring security for farm workers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/49_labor_regulations/49.46_minimum_wage_requirements_and_labor_standards.html">49.46.130</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/49_labor_regulations/49.46_minimum_wage_requirements_and_labor_standards.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
