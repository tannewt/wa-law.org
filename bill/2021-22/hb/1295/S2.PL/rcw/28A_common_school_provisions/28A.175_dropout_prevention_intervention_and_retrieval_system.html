<p>This section and RCW 28A.175.105 through 28A.175.115 provide a statutory framework for a statewide dropout reengagement system to provide appropriate educational opportunities and access to services for students age sixteen to twenty-one who have dropped out of high school or are not accumulating sufficient credits to reasonably complete a high school diploma in a public school before the age of twenty-one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the system, school districts may:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Enter into the model interlocal agreement developed under RCW 28A.175.110 with an educational service district, community or technical college, or other public entity to provide a dropout reengagement program for eligible students of the district; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter into the model contract developed under RCW 28A.175.110 with a community-based organization to provide a dropout reengagement program for eligible students of the district.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a school district does not enter an interlocal agreement or contract with an educational service district, community or technical college, other public entity, or community-based organization to provide a dropout reengagement program for eligible students residing in the district, the educational service district, community or technical college, other public entity, or community-based organization may petition a school district other than the resident school district to enroll the eligible students under RCW 28A.225.220 through 28A.225.230 and enter the interlocal agreement or contract with the petitioning entity to provide a dropout reengagement program for the eligible students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not affect the authority of school districts to contract for educational services under RCW 28A.150.305 and 28A.320.035.

A dropout reengagement program is not required to offer instruction in only those subject areas where a student is deficient in accumulated credits. Academic instruction must be provided by teachers certified by the Washington professional educator standards board or by instructors employed by a community or technical college whose required credentials are established by the college;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Case management, academic and career counseling, and assistance with accessing services and resources that support at-risk youth and reduce barriers to educational success; and</p>

<li>
<p>&quot;Eligible student&quot; means a student who:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Is at least sixteen but less than twenty-one years of age at the beginning of the school year;</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Is enrolled or enrolls in the school district in which the student resides, or is enrolled or enrolls in <strong>an institutional education program as defined in section 3 of this act or</strong> a nonresident school district under RCW 28A.225.220 through 28A.225.230.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Full-time equivalent eligible student&quot; means an eligible student whose enrollment and attendance meet criteria adopted by the office of the superintendent of public instruction specifically for dropout reengagement programs. The criteria shall be:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Based on the community or technical college credits generated by the student if the program provider is a community or technical college; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on a minimum amount of planned programming or instruction and minimum attendance by the student rather than hours of seat time if the program provider is a community-based organization.</p>

<p>Annually calculate the proportion of students in each high school who are suspended or expelled from school, as reported by the high school.

The metric used through the 2012-13 school year shall include the indicators in subsection (1)(a) through (c) of this section and shall measure improvement against the 2010-11 school year as the baseline year. Beginning in the 2013-14 school year, the metric shall also include the indicator in subsection (1)(d) of this section, with improvement in this indicator measured against the 2012-13 school year as the baseline year.

<li>
<p>Ten percent of an award under this section must be allocated to the school district in which the eligible high school is located to be used for dropout prevention activities as specified in subsection (2) of this section in the high school or in other schools in the district.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction may withhold distribution of award funds under this section to an otherwise eligible high school or school district if the superintendent of public instruction issues a finding that the school or school district has willfully manipulated the dropout prevention indicators under RCW 28A.175.140, for example by expelling, suspending, transferring, or refusing to enroll students at risk of dropping out of school or at risk of low achievement.</p>

<p>High schools and school districts may use PASS program award funds for any programs or activities that support the development of a dropout prevention, intervention, and reengagement system as described in RCW 28A.175.074, offered directly by the school or school district or under contract with education agencies or community-based organizations, including but not limited to educational service districts, workforce development councils, and boys and girls clubs.

Revenues to the account shall consist of appropriations made by the legislature, federal funds, gifts or grants from the private sector or foundations, and other sources deposited in the account. Expenditures from the account may be used only for proven dropout prevention and intervention programs identified under RCW 28A.175.135 and to make PASS program awards under RCW 28A.175.145. Only the superintendent of public instruction or the superintendent's designee may authorize expenditures from the account. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures.</p>
