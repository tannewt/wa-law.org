</li>
<li>
<p>The commission may suspend or revoke a registration upon complaint by any interested party, or upon the commission's own motion after notice and opportunity for hearing, when it finds that a registered community solar <strong>project manager</strong> or its agent has violated this chapter or the rules of the commission, or that the community solar <strong>project manager</strong> or its agent has been found by a court or governmental agency to have violated the laws of a state or the United States.</p>
