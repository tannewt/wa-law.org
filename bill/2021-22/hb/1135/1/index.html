The legislature has determined that the current vessel procurement process must move forward with all due speed, balancing the interests of both the taxpayers and shipyards. To accomplish construction of vessels in accordance with RCW 47.60.810, the prevailing shipbuilder, for vessels initially funded after July 1, 2020, is encouraged to follow the historical practice of subcontracting the construction of ferry superstructures to a separate nonaffiliated contractor located within the Puget Sound region, that is qualified in accordance with RCW 47.60.690.</p>

<p>FUND TRANSFERS</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The 2005 transportation partnership projects or improvements and 2015 connecting Washington projects or improvements are listed in the OFM Transportation Document 21GOV001 as developed December 17, 2020, which consists of a list of specific projects by fund source and amount over a 16-year period. Current fiscal biennium funding for each project is a line-item appropriation, while the outer year funding allocations represent a 16-year plan. The department of transportation is expected to use the flexibility provided in this section to assist in the delivery and completion of all transportation partnership account and connecting Washington account projects on the OFM transportation document referenced in this subsection. For the 2021-2023 project appropriations, unless otherwise provided in this act, the director of the office of financial management may provide written authorization for a transfer of appropriation authority between projects funded with transportation partnership account appropriations or connecting Washington account appropriations to manage project spending and efficiently deliver all projects in the respective program under the following conditions and limitations:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Transfers may only be made within each specific fund source referenced on the respective project list;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfers from a project may not be made as a result of the reduction of the scope of a project or be made to support increases in the scope of a project;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfers from a project may be made if the funds appropriated to the project are in excess of the amount needed in the current fiscal biennium;</p>

<p>Transfers to a project may not be made with funds designated as attributable to practical design savings as described in RCW 47.01.480;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each transfer between projects may only occur if the director of the office of financial management finds that any resulting change will not hinder the completion of the projects as approved by the legislature. Until the legislature reconvenes to consider the 2022 supplemental omnibus transportation appropriations act, any unexpended 2019-2021 appropriation balance as approved by the office of financial management, in consultation with the chairs and ranking members of the house of representatives and senate transportation committees, may be considered when transferring funds between projects; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfers between projects may be made by the department of transportation without the formal written approval provided under this subsection (1), provided that the transfer amount does not exceed $250,000 or 10 percent of the total project, whichever is less. These transfers must be reported quarterly to the director of the office of financial management and the chairs of the house of representatives and senate transportation committees.</p>
