<p>The legislature finds that in 2020, the world faced an enormous challenge in responding to the novel coronavirus pandemic. Washington was no exception, having been the site of the first confirmed coronavirus infection in the United States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that Washington's response to the pandemic was one of the best in the nation; however, the state should continue on the path of refining its response mechanisms and devising new strategies for preparing for future outbreaks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that this important work is critical to public health and safety.</p>
</li>
<li>

The knowledge and experience of each field will be necessary for an effective study of Washington's response to the novel coronavirus pandemic and the creation of future response plans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends that the scope of the task force's authority be interpreted broadly to allow for the most complete analysis of pandemic preparation and response options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further intends that the report produced by the task force be informative and comprehensive and include recommendations for future pandemic preparation and response by all levels of government in Washington.</p>
