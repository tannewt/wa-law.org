<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>In 2020, the world faced an enormous challenge in responding to the novel coronavirus pandemic. Washington was no exception, having been the site of the first confirmed coronavirus infection in the United States;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington's response to the pandemic was one of the best in the nation; however, the state must conduct a comprehensive after-action review of the response to identify lessons learned, implement corrective actions, and devise new strategies for preparing for future outbreaks;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This important work is critical to public health and safety;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A task force of professionals from across the spectrum of affected stakeholders should be assembled to coordinate the after-action review and recommend actions the state can implement to improve pandemic response. The knowledge and experience of each field will be necessary for an effective study of Washington's response to the novel coronavirus pandemic and the creation of future response plans; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lessons learned from both the pandemic response and the pandemic recovery could identify gaps that would inform next steps for preparedness strategies that could be implemented for a pandemic and potentially other all-hazards preparedness strategies that would benefit Washington state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The scope of the task force's authority be interpreted broadly to allow for the most complete analysis of pandemic response, using established national standards for conducting emergency or disaster after-action reviews, and to provide lessons learned and recommendations to the legislature; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The report produced by the task force be informative and comprehensive and include lessons learned and recommendations that will inform preparedness and response at all levels of government.</p>
