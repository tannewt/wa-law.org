## 64.06.022 - Disclosure of possible proximity to farm or working forest.
A seller of residential real property shall make available to the buyer the following statement: "This notice is to inform you that the real property you are considering for purchase may lie in close proximity to a farm or working forest. The operation of a farm or working forest involves usual and customary agricultural practices or forest practices, which are protected under RCW 7.48.305, the Washington right to farm act."

## 64.06.030 - Delivery of disclosure statement—Buyer's options—Time frame.
Unless the buyer has expressly waived the right to receive the disclosure statement, not later than five business days or as otherwise agreed to, after mutual acceptance of a written agreement between a buyer and a seller for the purchase and sale of residential real property, the seller shall deliver to the buyer a completed, signed, and dated real property transfer disclosure statement. Within three business days, or as otherwise agreed to, of receipt of the real property transfer disclosure statement, the buyer shall have the right to exercise one of the following two options: (1) Approving and accepting the real property transfer disclosure statement; or (2) rescinding the agreement for the purchase and sale of the property, which decision may be made by the buyer in the buyer's sole discretion. If the buyer elects to rescind the agreement, the buyer must deliver written notice of rescission to the seller within the three-business-day period, or as otherwise agreed to, and upon delivery of the written rescission notice the buyer shall be entitled to immediate return of all deposits and other considerations less any agreed disbursements paid to the seller, or to the seller's agent or an escrow agent for the seller's account, and the agreement for purchase and sale shall be void. If the buyer does not deliver a written recision notice to [the] seller within the three-business-day period, or as otherwise agreed to, the real property transfer disclosure statement will be deemed approved and accepted by the buyer.

## 64.06.040 - After delivery of disclosure statement—Additional information—Seller's duty—Buyer's options—Closing the transaction.
1. If, after the date that a seller of real property completes a real property transfer disclosure statement, the seller learns from a source other than the buyer or others acting on the buyer's behalf such as an inspector of additional information or an adverse change which makes any of the disclosures made inaccurate, the seller shall amend the real property transfer disclosure statement, and deliver the amendment to the buyer. No amendment shall be required, however, if the seller takes whatever corrective action is necessary so that the accuracy of the disclosure is restored, or the adverse change is corrected, at least three business days prior to the closing date. Unless the corrective action is completed by the seller prior to the closing date, the buyer shall have the right to exercise one of the following two options: (a) Approving and accepting the amendment, or (b) rescinding the agreement of purchase and sale of the property within three business days after receiving the amended real property transfer disclosure statement. Acceptance or recision shall be subject to the same procedures described in RCW 64.06.030. If the closing date provided in the purchase and sale agreement is scheduled to occur within the three-business-day rescission period provided for in this section, the closing date shall be extended until the expiration of the three-business-day rescission period. The buyer shall have no right of rescission if the seller takes whatever action is necessary so that the accuracy of the disclosure is restored at least three business days prior to the closing date.

2. In the event any act, occurrence, or agreement arising or becoming known after the closing of a real property transfer causes a real property transfer disclosure statement to be inaccurate in any way, the seller of such property shall have no obligation to amend the disclosure statement, and the buyer shall not have the right to rescind the transaction under this chapter.

3. If the seller in a real property transfer fails or refuses to provide to the prospective buyer a real property transfer disclosure statement as required under this chapter, the prospective buyer's right of rescission under this section shall apply until the earlier of three business days after receipt of the real property transfer disclosure statement or the date the transfer has closed, unless the buyer has otherwise waived the right of rescission in writing. Closing is deemed to occur when the buyer has paid the purchase price, or down payment, and the conveyance document, including a deed or real estate contract, from the seller has been delivered and recorded. After closing, the seller's obligation to deliver the real property transfer disclosure statement and the buyer's rights and remedies under this chapter shall terminate.

4. Failure of a homeowners' association or its officers, directors, employees, or authorized agents to provide requested information in part 8 of the disclosure statement form in RCW 64.06.015 or part 6 of the disclosure statement form in RCW 64.06.020 does not constitute a seller's failure or refusal to provide a real property transfer disclosure statement under subsection (3) of this section.

## 64.06.050 - Error, inaccuracy, or omission in disclosure statement—Actual knowledge—Liability.
1. The seller shall not be liable for any error, inaccuracy, or omission in the real property transfer disclosure statement if the seller had no actual knowledge of the error, inaccuracy, or omission. Unless the seller has actual knowledge of an error, inaccuracy, or omission in a real property transfer disclosure statement, the seller shall not be liable for such error, inaccuracy, or omission if the disclosure was based on information provided by public agencies, or by other persons providing information within the scope of their professional license or expertise, including, but not limited to, a report or opinion delivered by a land surveyor, title company, title insurance company, structural inspector, pest inspector, licensed engineer, or contractor.

2. Any real estate licensee involved in a real property transaction is not liable for any error, inaccuracy, or omission in the real property transfer disclosure statement if the licensee had no actual knowledge of the error, inaccuracy, or omission. Unless the licensee has actual knowledge of an error, inaccuracy, or omission in a real property transfer disclosure statement, the licensee shall not be liable for such error, inaccuracy, or omission if the disclosure was based on information provided by public agencies, or by other persons providing information within the scope of their professional license or expertise, including, but not limited to, a report or opinion delivered by a land surveyor, title company, title insurance company, structural inspector, pest inspector, licensed engineer, or contractor.
