<h2 id="7439a005---findings-5">74.39A.005 - Findings. <a class="header-anchor" href="#7439a005---findings-5">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the aging of the population and advanced medical technology have resulted in a growing number of persons who require assistance. The primary resource for long-term care continues to be family and friends. However, these traditional caregivers are increasingly employed outside the home. There is a growing demand for improvement and expansion of home and community-based long-term care services to support and complement the services provided by these informal caregivers.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that the public interest would best be served by a broad array of long-term care services that support persons who need such services at home or in the community whenever practicable and that promote individual autonomy, dignity, and choice.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that as other long-term care options become more available, the relative need for nursing home beds is likely to decline. The legislature recognizes, however, that nursing home care will continue to be a critical part of the state's long-term care options, and that such services should promote individual dignity, autonomy, and a homelike environment.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that many recipients of in-home services are vulnerable and their health and well-being are dependent on their caregivers. The quality, skills, and knowledge of their caregivers are often the key to good care. The legislature finds that the need for well-trained caregivers is growing as the state's population ages and clients' needs increase. The legislature intends that current training standards be enhanced.</p>

<li>
<p>The department shall establish in rule a new medicaid payment system for contracted assisted living, adult residential care, and enhanced adult residential care. Beginning July 1, 2019, payments for these contracts must be based on the new methodology which must be phased-in to full implementation according to funding made available by the legislature for this purpose. The new payment system must have these components: Client care, operations, and room and board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Client care is the labor component of the system and must include variables to recognize the time and intensity of client care and services, staff wages, and associated fringe benefits. The wage variable in the client care component must be adjusted according to service areas based on labor costs.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The time variable is used to weight the client care payment to client acuity and must be scaled according to the classification levels utilized in the department's assessment tool. The initial system shall establish a variable for time using the residential care time study conducted in 2001 and the department's corresponding estimate of the average staff hours per client by job position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The wage variable shall include recognition of staff positions needed to perform the functions required by contract, including nursing services. Data used to establish the wage variable must be adjusted so that no baseline wage is below the state minimum in effect at the time of implementation. The wage variable is a blended wage based on the federal bureau of labor statistics wage data and the distribution of time according to staff position. Blended wages are established for each county and then counties are arrayed from highest to lowest. Service areas are established and the median blended wage in each service area becomes the wage variable for all the assigned counties in that service area. The system must have no less than two service areas, one of which shall be a high labor cost service area and shall include counties at or above the ninety-fifth percentile in the array of blended wages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fringe benefit variable recognizes employee benefits and payroll taxes. The factor to calculate the percentage of fringe benefits shall be established using the statewide nursing facility cost ratio of benefits and payroll taxes to in-house wages.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The operations component must recognize costs that are allowable under federal medicaid rules for the federal matching percentage. The operations component is calculated at ninety percent or greater of the statewide median nursing facility costs associated with the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Supplies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nonlabor administrative expenses;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Staff education and in-service training; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operational overhead including licenses, insurance, and business and occupational [occupation] taxes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The room and board component recognizes costs that do not qualify for federal financial participation under medicaid rules by compensating providers for the medicaid client's share of raw food and shelter costs including expenses related to the physical plant such as property taxes, property and liability insurance, debt service, and major capital repairs. The room and board component is subject to the department's and the Washington state health care authority's rules related to client financial responsibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsections (2) and (3) of this section establish the rate for medicaid covered services. Subsection (4) of this section establishes the rate for nonmedicaid covered services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rates paid on July 1, 2019, shall be based on data from the 2016 calendar year, except for the time variable under subsection (2)(a) of this section. The client care and operations components must be rebased in even-numbered years. Beginning with rates paid on July 1, 2020, wages, benefits and taxes, and operations costs shall be rebased using 2018 data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning July 1, 2020, the room and board component shall be updated annually subject to the department's and the Washington state health care authority's rules related to client financial responsibility.</p>

<p>The goal of the system is continuous quality improvement with the focus on consumer satisfaction and outcomes for consumers. This includes that when conducting licensing or contract inspections, the department shall interview an appropriate percentage of residents, family members, resident case managers, and advocates in addition to interviewing providers and staff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providers should be supported in their efforts to improve quality and address identified problems initially through training, consultation, technical assistance, and case management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The emphasis should be on problem prevention both in monitoring and in screening potential providers of service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitoring should be outcome based and responsive to consumer complaints and based on a clear set of health, quality of care, and safety standards that are easily understandable and have been made available to providers, residents, and other interested parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prompt and specific enforcement remedies shall also be implemented without delay, pursuant to RCW 70.97.110, 71A.12.300, 74.39A.080, or 70.128.160, or chapter 18.51 or 74.42 RCW, for providers found to have delivered care or failed to deliver care resulting in problems that are serious, recurring, or uncorrected, or that create a hazard that is causing or likely to cause death or serious harm to one or more residents. These enforcement remedies may also include, when appropriate, reasonable conditions on a contract or license. In the selection of remedies, the safety, health, and well-being of residents shall be of paramount importance.</p>

<p>The aging and long-term support administration of the department shall establish and maintain a toll-free telephone number for receiving complaints regarding facilities and community residential services businesses as defined in this chapter.</p>

<li>
<p>Each facility shall post in a place and manner clearly visible to residents and visitors the department's toll-free complaint telephone number and the toll-free number and program description of the long-term care ombuds as required by RCW 43.190.050.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The aging and long-term support administration shall investigate complaints it receives about facilities and community residential services businesses unless the department determines that: (a) The complaint is intended to willfully harass the provider or the provider's employee; or (b) there is no reasonable basis for investigation; or (c) corrective action has been taken as determined by the ombuds or the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The aging and long-term support administration shall refer complaints to appropriate state agencies, law enforcement agencies, the attorney general, the long-term care ombuds, or other entities if the department lacks authority to investigate or if its investigation reveals that a follow-up referral to one or more of these entities is appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall adopt rules that include the following complaint investigation protocols:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Upon receipt of a complaint, the department shall make a preliminary review of the complaint, assess the severity of the complaint, and assign an appropriate response time. Complaints involving imminent danger to the health, safety, or well-being of a resident must be responded to within two days. When appropriate, the department shall make an on-site investigation within a reasonable time after receipt of the complaint or otherwise ensure that complaints are responded to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The complainant must be: Promptly contacted by the department, unless anonymous or unavailable despite several attempts by the department, and informed of the right to discuss the alleged violations with the inspector and to provide other information the complainant believes will assist the inspector; informed of the department's course of action; and informed of the right to receive a written copy of the investigation report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In conducting the investigation, the department shall interview the complainant, unless anonymous, and shall use its best efforts to interview the vulnerable adult or adults allegedly harmed, and, consistent with the protection of the vulnerable adult shall interview facility staff, any available independent sources of relevant information, including if appropriate the family members of the vulnerable adult.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Substantiated complaints involving harm to a resident, if an applicable law or rule has been violated, shall be subject to one or more of the actions provided in RCW 74.39A.080 or 70.128.160. Whenever appropriate, the department shall also give consultation and technical assistance to the provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a department finding of a violation for which a stop placement has been imposed, the department shall make an on-site revisit of the provider within fifteen working days from the request for revisit, to ensure correction of the violation. For violations that are serious or recurring or uncorrected following a previous citation, and create actual or threatened harm to one or more residents' well-being, including violations of residents' rights, the department shall make an on-site revisit as soon as appropriate to ensure correction of the violation. Verification of correction of all other violations may be made by either a department on-site revisit or by written or photographic documentation found by the department to be credible. This subsection does not prevent the department from enforcing license or contract suspensions or revocations. Nothing in this subsection shall interfere with or diminish the department's authority and duty to ensure that the provider adequately cares for residents, including to make departmental on-site revisits as needed to ensure that the provider protects residents and to enforce compliance with this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Substantiated complaints of neglect, abuse, exploitation, or abandonment of residents, or suspected criminal violations, shall also be referred by the department to the appropriate law enforcement agencies, the attorney general, and appropriate professional disciplining authority.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may provide the substance of the complaint to the licensee or contractor before the completion of the investigation by the department unless such disclosure would reveal the identity of a complainant, witness, or resident who chooses to remain anonymous. Neither the substance of the complaint provided to the licensee or contractor nor any copy of the complaint or related report published, released, or made otherwise available shall disclose, or reasonably lead to the disclosure of, the name, title, or identity of any complainant, or other person mentioned in the complaint, except that the name of the provider and the name or names of any officer, employee, or agent of the department conducting the investigation shall be disclosed after the investigation has been closed and the complaint has been substantiated. The department may disclose the identity of the complainant if such disclosure is requested in writing by the complainant. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to interfere with the obligation of the long-term care ombuds program or department staff to monitor the department's licensing, contract, and complaint investigation files for long-term care facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The resident has the right to be free of interference, coercion, discrimination, and reprisal from a facility in exercising his or her rights, including the right to voice grievances about treatment furnished or not furnished. A facility that provides long-term care services shall not discriminate or retaliate in any manner against a resident, employee, or any other person on the basis or for the reason that such resident or any other person made a complaint to the department, the attorney general, law enforcement agencies, or the long-term care ombuds, provided information, or otherwise cooperated with the investigation of such a complaint. Any attempt to discharge a resident against the resident's wishes, or any type of retaliatory treatment of a resident by whom or upon whose behalf a complaint substantiated by the department has been made to the department, the attorney general, law enforcement agencies, or the long-term care ombuds, within one year of the filing of the complaint, raises a rebuttable presumption that such action was in retaliation for the filing of the complaint. &quot;Retaliatory treatment&quot; means, but is not limited to, monitoring a resident's phone, mail, or visits; involuntary seclusion or isolation; transferring a resident to a different room unless requested or based upon legitimate management reasons; withholding or threatening to withhold food or treatment unless authorized by a terminally ill resident or his or her representative pursuant to law; or persistently delaying responses to a resident's request for service or assistance. A facility that provides long-term care services shall not willfully interfere with the performance of official duties by a long-term care ombuds. The department shall sanction and may impose a civil penalty of not more than three thousand dollars for a violation of this subsection.</p>

<p>The department is authorized to take one or more of the actions listed in subsection (2) of this section in any case in which the department finds that a provider of assisted living services, adult residential care services, or enhanced adult residential care services has:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Failed or refused to comply with the requirements of this chapter or the rules adopted under this chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operated without a license or under a revoked license;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowingly, or with reason to know, made a false statement of material fact on his or her application for license or any data attached thereto, or in any matter under investigation by the department; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Willfully prevented or interfered with any inspection or investigation by the department.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>When authorized by subsection (1) of this section, the department may take one or more of the following actions:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Refuse to issue a contract;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impose reasonable conditions on a contract, such as correction within a specified time, training, and limits on the type of clients the provider may admit or serve;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impose civil penalties of not more than one hundred dollars per day per violation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suspend, revoke, or refuse to renew a contract; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suspend admissions to the facility by imposing stop placement on contracted services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the department orders stop placement, the facility shall not admit any person admitted by contract until the stop placement order is terminated. The department may approve readmission of a resident to the facility from a hospital or nursing home during the stop placement. The department shall terminate the stop placement when: (a) The violations necessitating the stop placement have been corrected; and (b) the provider exhibits the capacity to maintain correction of the violations previously found deficient. However, if upon the revisit the department finds new violations that the department reasonably believes will result in a new stop placement, the previous stop placement shall remain in effect until the new stop placement is imposed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After a department finding of a violation for which a stop placement has been imposed, the department shall make an on-site revisit of the provider within fifteen working days from the request for revisit, to ensure correction of the violation. For violations that are serious or recurring or uncorrected following a previous citation, and create actual or threatened harm to one or more residents' well-being, including violations of residents' rights, the department shall make an on-site revisit as soon as appropriate to ensure correction of the violation. Verification of correction of all other violations may be made by either a department on-site revisit or by written or photographic documentation found by the department to be credible. This subsection does not prevent the department from enforcing license suspensions or revocations. Nothing in this subsection shall interfere with or diminish the department's authority and duty to ensure that the provider adequately cares for residents, including to make departmental on-site revisits as needed to ensure that the provider protects residents, and to enforce compliance with this chapter.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Chapter 34.05 RCW applies to department actions under this section, except that orders of the department imposing contracts suspension, stop placement, or conditions for continuation of a contract are effective immediately upon notice and shall continue pending any hearing.</li>

In determining eligibility for chore services, the department shall consider the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The kind of services needed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The degree of service need, and the extent to which an individual is dependent upon such services to remain in his or her home or return to his or her home;</p>

<li>
<p>The availability of personal or community resources which may be utilized to meet the individual's need; and</p>

To accommodate the role of the state as payor for the community-based services provided under this chapter and to ensure coordination with state employee collective bargaining under chapter 41.80 RCW and the coordination necessary to implement RCW 74.39A.300, the public employer shall be represented for bargaining purposes by the governor or the governor's designee appointed under chapter 41.80 RCW. The department shall solicit input from the developmental disabilities council, the governor's committee on disability issues and employment, the state council on aging, and other consumer advocacy organizations to obtain informed input from consumers on their interests, including impacts on consumer choice, for all issues proposed for collective bargaining under subsections (5) and (7) of this section.</p>

<p>Chapter 41.56 RCW governs the collective bargaining relationship between the governor and individual providers, except as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter and except as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">

</li>
<li>
<p>Individual providers who are public employees solely for the purposes of collective bargaining under subsection (1) of this section are not, for that reason, employees of the state, its political subdivisions, or an area agency on aging for any purpose. Chapter 41.56 RCW applies only to the governance of the collective bargaining relationship between the employer and individual providers as provided in subsections (1) and (2) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consumers and prospective consumers retain the right to select, hire, supervise the work of, and terminate any individual provider providing services to them. Consumers may elect to receive long-term in-home care services from individual providers who are not referred to them by the department or a department contractor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as expressly limited in this section and RCW 74.39A.300, the wages, hours, and working conditions of individual providers are determined solely through collective bargaining as provided in this chapter. Except as described in RCW 74.39A.525, no agency or department of the state may establish policies or rules governing the wages or hours of individual providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section modifies:</p>

<li>
<p>The department's authority to deny individual provider contracts to individuals who will not be able to meet the needs of a consumer or to terminate contracts of individual providers who are not adequately meeting the needs of a particular consumer; or</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the request of the exclusive bargaining representative, the governor or the governor's designee appointed under chapter 41.80 RCW shall engage in collective bargaining, as defined in RCW 41.56.030(4), with the exclusive bargaining representative over the following subjects:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Employer contributions to the training partnership for the costs of: (i) Meeting all training and peer mentoring requirements under this chapter; and (ii) other training intended to promote the career development of individual providers; and</p>

<p>The state, the department, the area agencies on aging, or their contractors under this chapter may not be held vicariously or jointly liable for the action or inaction of any individual provider or prospective individual provider, whether or not that individual provider or prospective individual provider was included on the referral registry or referred to a consumer or prospective consumer. The existence of a collective bargaining agreement, the placement of an individual provider on the referral registry, or the development or approval of a plan of care for a consumer who chooses to use the services of an individual provider and the provision of case management services to that consumer, by the department or an area agency on aging, does not constitute a special relationship with the consumer.</p>

<p>Nothing in this section affects the state's responsibility with respect to unemployment insurance for individual providers. However, individual providers are not to be considered, as a result of the state assuming this responsibility, employees of the state.</p>

<p>If the department contracts with any individual providers for personal care services, funding will be determined in accordance with the following process:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Upon meeting the requirements of subsection (2) of this section, the governor must submit, as a part of the proposed biennial or supplemental operating budget submitted to the legislature under RCW 43.88.030, a request for funds necessary to administer in-home care programs under this chapter and to implement the compensation and fringe benefits provisions of a collective bargaining agreement entered into under RCW 74.39A.270 or for legislation necessary to implement such agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A request for funds necessary to implement the compensation and fringe benefits provisions of a collective bargaining agreement entered into under RCW 74.39A.270 shall not be submitted by the governor to the legislature unless such request:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Has been submitted to the director of financial management by October 1st prior to the legislative session at which the request is to be considered; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has been certified by the director of financial management as being feasible financially for the state or reflects the binding decision of an arbitrator reached under RCW 74.39A.270(2)(c).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature must approve or reject the submission of the request for funds as a whole. If the legislature rejects or fails to act on the submission, any such agreement will be reopened solely for the purpose of renegotiating the funds necessary to implement the agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When any increase in individual provider wages or benefits is negotiated or agreed to, no increase in wages or benefits negotiated or agreed to under this chapter will take effect unless and until, before its implementation, the department has determined that the increase is consistent with federal law and federal financial participation in the provision of services under Title XIX of the federal social security act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The governor shall periodically consult with the joint committee on employment relations established by RCW 41.80.010 regarding appropriations necessary to implement the compensation and fringe benefits provisions of any collective bargaining agreement and, upon completion of negotiations, advise the committee on the elements of the agreement and on any legislation necessary to implement such agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the expiration date of any collective bargaining agreement entered into under RCW 74.39A.270, all of the terms and conditions specified in any such agreement remain in effect until the effective date of a subsequent agreement, not to exceed one year from the expiration date stated in the agreement, except as provided in RCW 74.39A.270.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If, after the compensation and benefit provisions of an agreement are approved by the legislature, a significant revenue shortfall occurs resulting in reduced appropriations, as declared by proclamation of the governor or by resolution of the legislature, both parties shall immediately enter into collective bargaining for a mutually agreed upon modification of the agreement.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds and declares that universal precautions are important health and safety protections for home care clients and workers who provide direct care for those clients. The use of personal protective equipment such as gloves is an established component of universal precautions and a key tool to protect against exposure to blood-borne pathogens such as hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Most medicaid clients are eligible to receive gloves through their medicaid benefit, yet the majority of clients are not aware of or do not use this benefit and as a result do not have gloves available in the home for individual providers to use. The legislature intends to improve the availability and usage of gloves by individual providers as part of universal precautions by ensuring that medicaid clients access gloves through their medicaid benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For medicaid clients, the department shall coordinate with the health care authority to assist clients receiving personal care services in accessing gloves as part of their health benefit for individual providers to use in the course of providing tasks where universal precautions are warranted. The assistance by the department and the health care authority must be designed to facilitate clients being able to access gloves on a monthly basis in a cost-effective and easy to access manner and must be consistent with requirements to receive federal matching funds under medicaid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In cases where clients are not eligible to receive such gloves under medicaid, the department shall work with the health care authority to develop a methodology to ensure clients have access to gloves on a monthly basis in a cost-effective and easy to access manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall submit a brief report with data on utilization of gloves by clients who are served by individual providers to the health care committees of the legislature by December 1, 2015.</p>

<li>
<p>The department of social and health services shall refinance medicaid personal care services under the community first choice option. Beginning July 1, 2014, the department shall seek stakeholder input on program and system design prior to the submission of a proposal to the center for medicaid and medicare [centers for medicare and medicaid] services. The community first choice option shall be designed in such a way to meet the federal minimum maintenance of effort requirements and all service requirements as specified in federal rule. Optional services may also be included in the benefit package. In the first full year of implementation, the increase in per capita cost of services directly resulting from meeting the federal requirements of the community first choice option, as well as the cost of new optional services, shall not exceed a three percent increase over the per capita costs of personal care services in the fiscal year prior to full implementation of the community first choice option. The three percent limit on new expenditures shall not apply to cost increases that are not the result of implementing the community first choice option, including case load growth, case mix changes, inflation, vendor rate changes, expenditures necessary to meet state and federal law requirements, and any adjustments made pursuant to collective bargaining. The community first choice option must be fully implemented no later than August 30, 2015.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall use general fund—state savings from the refinance in this section to offset additional caseload, per capita cost increases, and staff resources necessary to implement the community first choice option. Any remaining general fund—state savings from the refinance shall be reserved for potential investments in home and community-based services for individuals with developmental disabilities or individuals with long-term care needs, including investments recommended by the joint legislative executive committee on aging and disability and the development and implementation council that the department must convene prior to submitting the proposed community first choice option to the centers for medicare and medicaid services. At a minimum, the final report to the legislature from the joint legislative executive committee on aging and disability must explore the cost and benefit of rate enhancements for providers of long-term services and supports, restoration of hours for in-home clients, additional investment in the family caregiver support program, and additional investment in the individual and family services program or other medicaid services to support individuals with developmental disabilities.</p>

<li>
<p>The department may establish and implement a consumer directed employer program to provide personal care, respite care, and similar services to individuals with functional impairments under programs authorized through the medicaid state plan or medicaid waiver authorities and similar state-funded in-home care programs.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The consumer directed employer program is a consumer directed program and must be operated in a manner consistent with federal medicaid requirements. The consumer directed employer is the legal employer of individual providers for administrative purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the consumer directed employer program, the consumer is the managing employer of individual providers and retains the primary right to select, dismiss, assign hours, and supervise the work of one or more individual providers, as long as the consumer's actions are consistent with the consumer's plan of care, this chapter, and state and federal law.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall endeavor to select and contract with one consumer directed employer to be a medicaid provider that will coemploy individual providers. The department shall make every effort to select a single qualified vendor. In the event it is not possible to contract with a single vendor, the department is authorized to contract with up to two vendors. The department's activities to identify, select, and contract with a consumer directed employer are exempt from the requirements of chapter 39.26 RCW.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>When contracting with a consumer directed employer, the department should seek to contract with a vendor that demonstrates:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>A strong commitment to consumer choice, self-direction, and maximizing consumer autonomy and control over daily decisions; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A commitment to recruiting and retaining a high quality and diverse workforce and working with a broad coalition of stakeholders in an effort to understand the changing needs of the workforce and consumer needs and preferences.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional factors the department should consider in selecting a vendor include, but are not limited to, the vendor's:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Ability to provide maximum support to consumers to focus on directing their own services through a model that recognizes that the provision of employer responsibility and human resource administration support is integral to successful self-directed home care programs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commitment to engage and work closely with consumers in design, implementation, and ongoing operations through an advisory board, focus group, or other methods as approved by the department;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus on workforce retention and creating incentives for qualified and trained providers to meet the growing needs of state long-term care consumers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to meet the state's interest in preventing or mitigating disruptions to consumer services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to deliver high quality training, health care, and retirement, which may include participation in existing trusts that deliver those benefits;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to comply with the terms and conditions of employment of individual providers at the time of the transition;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commitment to involving its home care workforce in decision making;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vision for including and enhancing home care workers as a valued member of the consumer's care team, as desired and authorized by the consumer and reflected in the consumer's plan of care; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to build and adapt technology tools that can enhance efficiency and provide better quality of services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to be qualified as a consumer directed employer, an entity must meet the requirements in: (i) Its contract with the department; (ii) the medicaid state plan; (iii) rules adopted under this chapter, if any; and (iv) this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any qualified and willing individual may apply to become an employee of a consumer directed employer and may work as an individual provider when selected by a consumer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A consumer directed employer that holds a contract with the department to provide medicaid services through the employment of individual providers is deemed to be a certified medicaid provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A consumer directed employer is not a home care agency under chapter 70.127 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A consumer directed employer does not need a separate licensure or certification category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A consumer directed employer that also provides home care services under chapter 70.127 RCW must demonstrate to the department's satisfaction that it operates the programs under separate business units, and that its business structures, policies, and procedures will prevent any conflicts of interest.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the department selects and contracts with a consumer directed employer, the department shall determine when to terminate the department's contracts with individual providers.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Until the department determines the transition to the consumer directed employer program is complete, the state shall continue to administer the individual provider program for the remaining contracted individual providers and to act as the public employer solely for the purpose of collective bargaining under RCW 74.39A.270 for those directly contracted individual providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the department determines that the transition to the consumer directed employer is complete, the department may no longer contract with individual providers, unless there are not any contracted consumer directed employers available.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of labor and industries shall initially place individual providers employed by a consumer directed employer in the classification for the home care services and home care referral registry. After the department determines that the transition to the consumer directed employer program is complete, the department of labor and industries may, if necessary, adjust the classification and rate in accordance with chapter 51.16 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the date on which the department enters into a contract with the consumer directed employer and determines the transition to the consumer directed employer program is complete, biennial funding in the next ensuing biennium for case management and social work shall be reduced by no more than: Two million nine hundred eight thousand dollars for area agencies on aging; one million three hundred sixty-one thousand dollars for home and community services; and one million two hundred eighty-nine thousand dollars for developmental disabilities.</p>

<p>The caseload forecast council may adopt a temporary adjustment to the eight and one-fourth percent of the total average in-home personal care hours projection for that fiscal year, up to a maximum of ten percent, if it finds a higher percentage of overtime hours is necessitated by a shortage of individual providers to provide adequate client care, taking into consideration factors including the criteria in subsection (1) of this section and rules adopted by the department.

</li>
<li>
<p>A rate-setting board is established which is comprised of the voting members and nonvoting members to evaluate and propose changes in the rates paid to the consumer directed employer.</p>

<p>Beginning in the year following the establishment of the initial rate under subsection (1) of this section, and in every even-numbered year thereafter, the rate-setting board shall attempt to determine a proposed labor rate, including a specific amount for health benefits by considering the factors listed in RCW 41.56.465 (1) and (5).

</li>
<li>
<p>On the first occasion that the voting members identified in subsection (2)(a) of this section fail to select a tie-breaking member by a majority vote, the chair member will be selected as follows:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The voting member representing the governor's office shall request a list of five qualified arbitrators, or six if there are two consumer directed employers, from the federal mediation and conciliation service.</p>
</li>

<p>If a majority of the voting members of the board cannot agree on the selection of a neutral arbitrator from the list, the representative from the consumer directed employer who first contacted the department will strike a name from the list first. The representative from the governor's office shall then strike a name from the list, the designee from the exclusive bargaining representative or, in the absence of an exclusive bargaining representative, the designee from the consumer directed employer workforce shall strike a name from the list, if there are two consumer directed employers, the second representative will strike a name from the list, and finally the representative from the department shall strike a name from the list.</p>

<p>If that person is not willing or available to be the chair member, the second to last person remaining on the list shall be asked to be the chair member.

<p>On the next occasion that the voting members identified in subsection (2)(a) of this section fail to select a chair member by a majority vote, the chair member will be selected using the method described in (b) of this subsection except that the order of board members striking names from the list, described in (b)(ii) of this subsection, shall be reversed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On each successive occasion that the voting members identified in subsection (2)(a) of this section fail to select a chair member by a majority vote, the order of voting members striking names from the list will continue to alternate between the order described in (b)(ii) and (c) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>If an agreement on a proposed labor rate, an administrative rate, or both, is not reached by a majority of the voting members of the rate-setting board prior to July 1st, then:</p>

</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>After the rates have been determined in accordance with subsections (3) through (6) of this section, they shall be submitted to the director of the office of financial management by October 1st prior to the legislative session during which the requests are to be considered for review.

The legislature shall approve or reject the request for funds as a whole.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the legislature rejects the request under subsection (6) of this section, the matter shall return to the rate-setting board established under this section for further consideration. Until the legislature approves a request for funds under this section, the current labor rate shall stay in effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The labor rate approved by the legislature shall be an hourly rate paid to the consumer directed employer. The labor rate shall be used exclusively for paying the wages, associated taxes, and benefits of individual providers. The consumer directed employer shall have full discretion to set wages and benefits for individual providers, except as provided in: (a) Subsection (10) of this section; (b) any specific legislative appropriation requirement; or (c) a collective bargaining agreement, if applicable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The labor rate shall include a specific hourly amount that the consumer directed employer may use only for health benefits for individual providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall make a one-time transfer of funds totaling the full amount of previously unclaimed paid time off to the consumer directed employer, and shall transfer all associated liabilities for payment of unclaimed paid time off to the consumer directed employer. This amount shall be accounted for as a labor rate payment.</p>

<li>
<p>The department shall have the authority to modify the labor rate and the administrative rate between the rate-setting board's rate-setting activities without convening the rate-setting board or following the preceding rate-setting process, subject to the following conditions:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Comply with a significant change in state or federal rule or law that would impact the consumer directed employer's ability to operate;</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes to the rates shall not exceed two percent of the combined labor and administrative rates; and</p>
