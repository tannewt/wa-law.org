<p>The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the development, establishment, and enforcement of standards for the maintenance and operation of assisted living facilities, which, in the light of advancing knowledge, will promote safe and adequate care of the individuals therein. It is further the intent of the legislature that assisted living facilities be available to meet the needs of those for whom they care by recognizing the capabilities of individuals to direct their self-medication or to use supervised self-medication techniques when ordered and approved by a physician licensed under chapter 18.57 or 18.71 RCW or a podiatric physician and surgeon licensed under chapter 18.22 RCW.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that many residents of community-based long-term care facilities are vulnerable and their health and well-being are dependent on their caregivers. The quality, skills, and knowledge of their caregivers are often the key to good care. The legislature finds that the need for well-trained caregivers is growing as the state's population ages and residents' needs increase. The legislature intends that current training standards be enhanced.</p>

If there is a failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter or the rules adopted under this chapter, the department may in its discretion issue a provisional license to an applicant for a license or for the renewal of a license. A provisional license permits the operation of the assisted living facility for a period to be determined by the department, but not to exceed twelve months and is not subject to renewal. The department may also place conditions on the license under RCW 18.20.190.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the time of the application for or renewal of a license or provisional license, the licensee shall pay a license fee. Beginning July 1, 2011, and thereafter, the per bed license fee must be established in the omnibus appropriations act and any amendment or additions made to that act. The license fees established in the omnibus appropriations act and any amendment or additions made to that act may not exceed the department's annual licensing and oversight activity costs and must include the department's cost of paying providers for the amount of the license fee attributed to medicaid clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A license issued under this chapter may not exceed twelve months in duration and expires on a date set by the department. An assisted living facility license must be issued only to the person that applied for the license. All applications for renewal of a license shall be made not later than thirty days prior to the date of expiration of the license. Each license shall be issued only for the premises and persons named in the application, and no license shall be transferable or assignable. Licenses shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the licensed premises.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A licensee who receives notification of the department's initiation of a denial, suspension, nonrenewal, or revocation of an assisted living facility license may, in lieu of appealing the department's action, surrender or relinquish the license. The department shall not issue a new license to or contract with the licensee, for the purposes of providing care to vulnerable adults or children, for a period of twenty years following the surrendering or relinquishment of the former license. The licensing record shall indicate that the licensee relinquished or surrendered the license, without admitting the violations, after receiving notice of the department's initiation of a denial, suspension, nonrenewal, or revocation of a license.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall establish, by rule, the circumstances requiring a change in licensee, which include, but are not limited to, a change in ownership or control of the assisted living facility or licensee, a change in the licensee's form of legal organization, such as from sole proprietorship to partnership or corporation, and a dissolution or merger of the licensed entity with another legal organization. The new licensee is subject to the provisions of this chapter, the rules adopted under this chapter, and other applicable law. In order to ensure that the safety of residents is not compromised by a change in licensee, the new licensee is responsible for correction of all violations that may exist at the time of the new license.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may deny, suspend, modify, revoke, or refuse to renew a license when the department finds that the applicant or licensee or any partner, officer, director, managerial employee, or majority owner of the applicant or licensee:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Operated an assisted living facility without a license or under a revoked or suspended license; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowingly or with reason to know made a false statement of a material fact (i) in an application for license or any data attached to the application, or (ii) in any matter under investigation by the department; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refused to allow representatives or agents of the department to inspect (i) the books, records, and files required to be maintained, or (ii) any portion of the premises of the assisted living facility; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Willfully prevented, interfered with, or attempted to impede in any way (i) the work of any authorized representative of the department, or (ii) the lawful enforcement of any provision of this chapter; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has a history of significant noncompliance with federal or state regulations in providing care or services to vulnerable adults or children. In deciding whether to deny, suspend, modify, revoke, or refuse to renew a license under this section, the factors the department considers shall include the gravity and frequency of the noncompliance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall serve upon the applicant a copy of the decision granting or denying an application for a license. An applicant shall have the right to contest denial of his or her application for a license as provided in chapter 34.05 RCW by requesting a hearing in writing within twenty-eight days after receipt of the notice of denial.</p>

<p>The department shall require each assisted living facility to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Create and regularly maintain a current resident roster containing the name and room number of each resident and provide a written copy immediately upon an in-person request from any long-term care ombuds;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create and regularly maintain current, accurate, and aggregated contact information for all residents, including contact information for the resident representative, if any, of each resident. The contact information for each resident must include the resident's name, room number, and, if available, telephone number and email address. The contact information for each resident representative must include the resident representative's name, relationship to the resident, phone number, and, if available, email and mailing address;</p>

<p>Record and update the aggregated contact information required by this section, upon receipt of new or updated contact information from the resident or resident representative; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon the written request of any long-term care ombuds that includes reference to this section and the relevant legal functions and duties of long-term care ombuds, provide a copy of the aggregated contact information required by this section within 48 hours, or within a reasonable time if agreed to by the requesting long-term care ombuds by electronic copy to the secure email address or facsimile number provided in the written request.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In accordance with the federal older Americans act, federal regulations, and state laws that govern the state long-term care ombuds program, the department shall inform assisted living facilities that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Any long-term care ombuds is authorized to request and obtain from assisted living facilities the information required by this section in order to perform the functions and duties of long-term care ombuds as set forth in federal and state laws;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state long-term care ombuds program and all long-term care ombuds are considered a &quot;health oversight agency,&quot; so that the federal health insurance portability and accountability act and chapter 70.02 RCW do not preclude assisted living facilities from providing the information required by this section when requested by any long-term care ombuds, and pursuant to these laws, the federal older Americans act, federal regulations, and state laws that govern the state long-term care ombuds program, facilities are not required to seek or obtain consent from residents or resident representatives prior to providing the information required by this section in accordance with the requirements of this section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The information required by this section, when provided by an assisted living facility to a requesting long-term care ombuds, becomes property of the state long-term care ombuds program and is subject to all state and federal laws governing the confidentiality and disclosure of the files, records, and information maintained by the state long-term care ombuds program or any local long-term care ombuds entity; and</p>

<li>
<p>The department shall make or cause to be made, at least every eighteen months with an annual average of fifteen months, an inspection and investigation of all assisted living facilities. However, the department may delay an inspection to twenty-four months if the assisted living facility has had three consecutive inspections with no written notice of violations and has received no written notice of violations resulting from complaint investigation during that same time period. The department may at anytime make an unannounced inspection of a licensed facility to assure that the licensee is in compliance with this chapter and the rules adopted under this chapter. Every inspection shall focus primarily on actual or potential resident outcomes, and may include an inspection of every part of the premises and an examination of all records, methods of administration, the general and special dietary, and the stores and methods of supply; however, the department shall not have access to financial records or to other records or reports described in RCW 18.20.390. Financial records of the assisted living facility may be examined when the department has reasonable cause to believe that a financial obligation related to resident care or services will not be met, such as a complaint that staff wages or utility costs have not been paid, or when necessary for the department to investigate alleged financial exploitation of a resident. Following such an inspection or inspections, written notice of any violation of this law or the rules adopted hereunder shall be given to the applicant or licensee and the department. The department may prescribe by rule that any licensee or applicant desiring to make specified types of alterations or additions to its facilities or to construct new facilities shall, before commencing such alteration, addition, or new construction, submit plans and specifications therefor to the agencies responsible for plan reviews for preliminary inspection and approval or recommendations with respect to compliance with the rules and standards herein authorized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If a pandemic, natural disaster, or other declared state of emergency prevents the department from completing inspections according to the timeline in subsection (1) of this section, the department shall adopt rules to reestablish inspection timelines based on the length of time since last inspection, compliance history of each facility, and immediate health or safety concerns.</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p><strong>Rules adopted under this subsection (2) are effective until the termination of the pandemic, natural disaster, or other declared state of emergency or until the department determines that all facility inspections are occurring according to time frames established in subsection (1) of this section, whichever is later. Once the department determines a rule adopted under this subsection (2) is no longer necessary, it must repeal the rule under RCW 34.05.353.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Within 12 months of the termination of the pandemic, natural disaster, or other declared state of emergency, the department shall conduct a review of inspection compliance with subsection (1) of this section and provide the legislature with a report.</strong></p>

<p>The department shall, within available funding for this purpose, develop and make available to assisted living facilities a quality improvement consultation program using the following principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The system shall be resident-centered and promote privacy, independence, dignity, choice, and a home or home-like environment for residents consistent with chapter 70.129 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The goal of the system is continuous quality improvement with the focus on resident satisfaction and outcomes for residents. The quality improvement consultation program shall be offered to assisted living facilities on a voluntary basis. Based on requests for the services of the quality improvement consultation program, the department may establish a process for prioritizing service availability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assisted living facilities should be supported in their efforts to improve quality and address problems, as identified by the licensee, initially through training, consultation, and technical assistance. At a minimum, the department may, within available funding, at the request of the assisted living facility, conduct on-site visits and telephone consultations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To facilitate collaboration and trust between the assisted living facilities and the department's quality improvement consultation program staff, the consultation program staff shall not simultaneously serve as department licensors, complaint investigators, or participate in any enforcement-related decisions, within the region in which they perform consultation activities; except such staff may investigate on an emergency basis, complaints anywhere in the state when the complaint indicates high risk to resident health or safety. Any records or information gained as a result of their work under the quality improvement consultation program shall not be disclosed to or shared with nonmanagerial department licensing or complaint investigation staff, unless necessary to carry out duties described under chapter 74.34 RCW. The emphasis should be on problem prevention. Nothing in this section shall limit or interfere with the consultant's mandated reporting duties under chapter 74.34 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall promote the development of a training system that is practical and relevant to the needs of residents and staff. To improve access to training, especially for rural communities, the training system may include, but is not limited to, the use of satellite technology distance learning that is coordinated through community colleges or other appropriate organizations.</p>

<p>Inspections must be outcome based and responsive to resident complaints and based on a clear set of health, quality of care, and safety standards that are easily understandable and have been made available to facilities, residents, and other interested parties.

</li>
<li>
<p>Prompt and specific enforcement remedies shall also be implemented without delay, consistent with RCW 18.20.190, for facilities found to have delivered care or failed to deliver care resulting in problems that are serious, recurring, or uncorrected, or that create a hazard that is causing or likely to cause death or serious harm to one or more residents. These enforcement remedies may also include, when appropriate, reasonable conditions on a license.

<ol>
<li>
<p>The department shall establish and maintain a toll-free telephone number for receiving complaints regarding a facility that the department licenses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All facilities that are licensed under this chapter shall post in a place and manner clearly visible to residents and visitors the department's toll-free complaint telephone number and the toll-free number and program description of the long-term care ombuds as provided by RCW 43.190.050.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall investigate complaints if the subject of the complaint is within its authority unless the department determines that: (a) The complaint is intended to willfully harass a licensee or employee of the licensee; or (b) there is no reasonable basis for investigation; or (c) corrective action has been taken as determined by the ombuds or the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall refer complaints to appropriate state agencies, law enforcement agencies, the attorney general, the long-term care ombuds, or other entities if the department lacks authority to investigate or if its investigation reveals that a follow-up referral to one or more of these entities is appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall adopt rules that include the following complaint investigation protocols:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Upon receipt of a complaint, the department shall make a preliminary review of the complaint, assess the severity of the complaint, and assign an appropriate response time. Complaints involving imminent danger to the health, safety, or well-being of a resident must be responded to within two days. When appropriate, the department shall make an on-site investigation within a reasonable time after receipt of the complaint or otherwise ensure that complaints are responded to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The complainant must be: Promptly contacted by the department, unless anonymous or unavailable despite several attempts by the department, and informed of the right to discuss alleged violations with the inspector and to provide other information the complainant believes will assist the inspector; informed of the department's course of action; and informed of the right to receive a written copy of the investigation report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In conducting the investigation, the department shall interview the complainant, unless anonymous, and shall use its best efforts to interview the resident or residents allegedly harmed by the violations, and, in addition to facility staff, any available independent sources of relevant information, including if appropriate the family members of the resident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Substantiated complaints involving harm to a resident, if an applicable law or regulation has been violated, shall be subject to one or more of the actions provided in RCW 18.20.190. Whenever appropriate, the department shall also give consultation and technical assistance to the facility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a department finding of a violation for which a stop placement has been imposed, the department shall make an on-site revisit of the provider within fifteen working days from the request for revisit, to ensure correction of the violation. For violations that are serious or recurring or uncorrected following a previous citation, and create actual or threatened harm to one or more residents' well-being, including violations of residents' rights, the department shall make an on-site revisit as soon as appropriate to ensure correction of the violation. Verification of correction of all other violations may be made by either a department on-site revisit or by written or photographic documentation found by the department to be credible. This subsection does not prevent the department from enforcing license suspensions or revocations. Nothing in this subsection shall interfere with or diminish the department's authority and duty to ensure that the provider adequately cares for residents, including to make departmental on-site revisits as needed to ensure that the provider protects residents, and to enforce compliance with this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Substantiated complaints of neglect, abuse, exploitation, or abandonment of residents, or suspected criminal violations, shall also be referred by the department to the appropriate law enforcement agencies, the attorney general, and appropriate professional disciplining authority.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may provide the substance of the complaint to the licensee before the completion of the investigation by the department unless such disclosure would reveal the identity of a complainant, witness, or resident who chooses to remain anonymous. Neither the substance of the complaint provided to the licensee or contractor nor any copy of the complaint or related report published, released, or made otherwise available shall disclose, or reasonably lead to the disclosure of, the name, title, or identity of any complainant, or other person mentioned in the complaint, except that the name of the provider and the name or names of any officer, employee, or agent of the department conducting the investigation shall be disclosed after the investigation has been closed and the complaint has been substantiated. The department may disclose the identity of the complainant if such disclosure is requested in writing by the complainant. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to interfere with the obligation of the long-term care ombuds program to monitor the department's licensing, contract, and complaint investigation files for long-term care facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The resident has the right to be free of interference, coercion, discrimination, and reprisal from a facility in exercising his or her rights, including the right to voice grievances about treatment furnished or not furnished. A facility licensed under this chapter shall not discriminate or retaliate in any manner against a resident, employee, or any other person on the basis or for the reason that such resident or any other person made a complaint to the department, the attorney general, law enforcement agencies, or the long-term care ombuds, provided information, or otherwise cooperated with the investigation of such a complaint. Any attempt to discharge a resident against the resident's wishes, or any type of retaliatory treatment of a resident by whom or upon whose behalf a complaint substantiated by the department has been made to the department, the attorney general, law enforcement agencies, or the long-term care ombuds, within one year of the filing of the complaint, raises a rebuttable presumption that such action was in retaliation for the filing of the complaint. &quot;Retaliatory treatment&quot; means, but is not limited to, monitoring a resident's phone, mail, or visits; involuntary seclusion or isolation; transferring a resident to a different room unless requested or based upon legitimate management reasons; withholding or threatening to withhold food or treatment unless authorized by a terminally ill resident or his or her representative pursuant to law; or persistently delaying responses to a resident's request for service or assistance. A facility licensed under this chapter shall not willfully interfere with the performance of official duties by a long-term care ombuds. The department shall sanction and may impose a civil penalty of not more than three thousand dollars for a violation of this subsection.</p>

<p>The licensee or its designee has the right to an informal dispute resolution process to dispute any violation found or enforcement remedy imposed by the department during a licensing inspection or complaint investigation. The purpose of the informal dispute resolution process is to provide an opportunity for an exchange of information that may lead to the modification, deletion, or removal of a violation, or parts of a violation, or enforcement remedy imposed by the department.</p>

<li>
<p>The informal dispute resolution process provided by the department shall include, but is not necessarily limited to, an opportunity for review by a department employee who did not participate in, or oversee, the determination of the violation or enforcement remedy under dispute. The department shall develop, or further develop, an informal dispute resolution process consistent with this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A request for an informal dispute resolution shall be made to the department within ten working days from the receipt of a written finding of a violation or enforcement remedy. The request shall identify the violation or violations and enforcement remedy or remedies being disputed. The department shall convene a meeting, when possible, within ten working days of receipt of the request for informal dispute resolution, unless by mutual agreement a later date is agreed upon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the department determines that a violation or enforcement remedy should not be cited or imposed, the department shall delete the violation or immediately rescind or modify the enforcement remedy. If the department determines that a violation should have been cited under a different more appropriate regulation, the department shall revise the report, statement of deficiencies, or enforcement remedy accordingly. Upon request, the department shall issue a clean copy of the revised report, statement of deficiencies, or notice of enforcement action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The request for informal dispute resolution does not delay the effective date of any enforcement remedy imposed by the department, except that civil monetary fines are not payable until the exhaustion of any formal hearing and appeal rights provided under this chapter. The licensee shall submit to the department, within the time period prescribed by the department, a plan of correction to address any undisputed violations, and including any violations that still remain following the informal dispute resolution.</p>

<p>&quot;Caregiver&quot; includes any person who provides residents with hands-on personal care on behalf of an assisted living facility, except volunteers who are directly supervised.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Direct supervision&quot; means oversight by a person who has demonstrated competency in the core areas or has been fully exempted from the training requirements pursuant to this section, is on the premises, and is quickly and easily available to the caregiver.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training must have the following components: Orientation, basic training, specialty training as appropriate, and continuing education. All assisted living facility employees or volunteers who routinely interact with residents shall complete orientation. Assisted living facility administrators, or their designees, and caregivers shall complete orientation, basic training, specialty training as appropriate, and continuing education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orientation consists of introductory information on residents' rights, communication skills, fire and life safety, and universal precautions. Orientation must be provided at the facility by appropriate assisted living facility staff to all assisted living facility employees before the employees have routine interaction with residents.</p>

<li>
<p>Basic training consists of modules on the core knowledge and skills that caregivers need to learn and understand to effectively and safely provide care to residents. Basic training must be outcome-based, and the effectiveness of the basic training must be measured by demonstrated competency in the core areas through the use of a competency test. Basic training must be completed by caregivers within one hundred twenty days of the date on which they begin to provide hands-on care. Until competency in the core areas has been demonstrated, caregivers shall not provide hands-on personal care to residents without direct supervision. Assisted living facility administrators, or their designees, must complete basic training and demonstrate competency within one hundred twenty days of employment.</p>

<li>
<p>When established, the quality assurance committee shall meet at least quarterly to identify issues that may adversely affect quality of care and services to residents and to develop and implement plans of action to correct identified quality concerns or deficiencies in the quality of care provided to residents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To promote quality of care through self-review without the fear of reprisal, and to enhance the objectivity of the review process, the department shall not require, and the long-term care ombuds program shall not request, disclosure of any quality assurance committee records or reports, unless the disclosure is related to the committee's compliance with this section, if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The records or reports are not maintained pursuant to statutory or regulatory mandate; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The records or reports are created for and collected and maintained by the committee.</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the assisted living facility refuses to release records or reports that would otherwise be protected under this section, the department may then request only that information that is necessary to determine whether the assisted living facility has a quality assurance committee and to determine that it is operating in compliance with this section. However, if the assisted living facility offers the department documents generated by, or for, the quality assurance committee as evidence of compliance with assisted living facility requirements, the documents are protected as quality assurance committee documents under subsections (6) and (8) of this section when in the possession of the department. The department is not liable for an inadvertent disclosure, a disclosure related to a required federal or state audit, or disclosure of documents incorrectly marked as quality assurance committee documents by the facility.</p>

<p>A quality assurance committee under subsection (1) of this section, RCW 70.41.200, 74.42.640, 4.24.250, or 43.70.510 may share information and documents, including the analysis of complaints and incident reports, created specifically for, and collected and maintained by, the committee, with one or more other quality assurance committees created under subsection (1) of this section, RCW 70.41.200, 74.42.640, 4.24.250, or 43.70.510 for the improvement of the quality of care and services rendered to assisted living facility residents. Information and documents disclosed by one quality assurance committee to another quality assurance committee and any information and documents created or maintained as a result of the sharing of information and documents shall not be subject to the discovery process and confidentiality shall be respected as required by subsections (6) and (8) of this section, RCW 43.70.510(4), 70.41.200(3), 4.24.250(1), and 74.42.640 (7) and (9). The privacy protections of chapter 70.02 RCW and the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and its implementing regulations apply to the sharing of individually identifiable patient information held by a coordinated quality improvement program. Any rules necessary to implement this section shall meet the requirements of applicable federal and state privacy laws.</p>

<li>
<p>Information and documents, including the analysis of complaints and incident reports, created specifically for, and collected and maintained by, a quality assurance committee are exempt from disclosure under chapter 42.56 RCW.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding any records created for the quality assurance committee, the facility shall fully set forth in the resident's records, available to the resident, the department, and others as permitted by law, the facts concerning any incident of injury or loss to the resident, the steps taken by the facility to address the resident's needs, and the resident outcome.</p>

<li>If the department determines that the health, safety, or welfare of residents is immediately jeopardized by an assisted living facility's failure or refusal to comply with the requirements of this chapter or the rules adopted under this chapter, and the department summarily suspends the assisted living facility license, the department may appoint a temporary manager of the assisted living facility, or the licensee may, subject to the department's approval, voluntarily participate in the temporary management program.</li>
</ol>
<p>The purposes of the temporary management program are as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>To mitigate dislocation and transfer trauma of residents while the department and licensee may pursue dispute resolution or appeal of a summary suspension of license;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To facilitate the continuity of safe and appropriate resident care and services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To protect the health, safety, and welfare of residents, by providing time for an orderly closure of the assisted living facility, or for the deficiencies that necessitated temporary management to be corrected; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To preserve a residential option that meets a specialized service need or is in a geographical area that has a lack of available providers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>The department may recruit, approve, and appoint qualified individuals, partnerships, corporations, and other entities interested in serving as a temporary manager of an assisted living facility. These individuals and entities shall satisfy the criteria established under this chapter or by the department for approving licensees. The department shall not approve or appoint any person, including partnerships and other entities, if that person is affiliated with the assisted living facility subject to the temporary management, or has owned or operated an assisted living facility ordered into temporary management or receivership in any state. When approving or appointing a temporary manager, the department shall consider the temporary manager's past experience in long-term care, the quality of care provided, the temporary manager's availability, and the person's familiarity with applicable state and federal laws. Subject to the provisions of this section and RCW 18.20.430, the department's authority to approve or appoint a temporary manager is discretionary and not subject to the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the department appoints a temporary manager, the department shall enter into a contract with the temporary manager and shall order the licensee to cease operating the assisted living facility and immediately turn over to the temporary manager possession and control of the assisted living facility, including but not limited to all resident care records, financial records, and other records necessary for operation of the facility while temporary management is in effect. If the department has not appointed a temporary manager and the licensee elects to participate in the temporary management program, the licensee shall select the temporary manager, subject to the department's approval, and enter into a contract with the temporary manager, consistent with this section. The department has the discretion to approve or revoke any temporary management arrangements made by the licensee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the department appoints a temporary manager, the costs associated with the temporary management may be paid for through the assisted living facility temporary management account established by RCW 18.20.430, or from other departmental funds, or a combination thereof. All funds must be administered according to department procedures. The department may enter into an agreement with the licensee allowing the licensee to pay for some of the costs associated with a temporary manager appointed by the department. If the department has not appointed a temporary manager and the licensee elects to participate in the temporary management program, the licensee is responsible for all costs related to administering the temporary management program at the assisted living facility and contracting with the temporary manager.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The temporary manager shall assume full responsibility for the daily operations of the assisted living facility and is responsible for correcting cited deficiencies and ensuring that all minimum licensing requirements are met. The temporary manager must comply with all state and federal laws and regulations applicable to assisted living facilities. The temporary manager shall protect the health, safety, and welfare of the residents for the duration of the temporary management and shall perform all acts reasonably necessary to ensure residents' needs are met. The temporary management contract shall address the responsibility of the temporary manager to pay past due debts. The temporary manager's specific responsibilities may include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Receiving and expending in a prudent and business-like manner all current revenues of the assisted living facility, provided that priority is given to debts and expenditures directly related to providing care and meeting residents' needs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hiring and managing all consultants and employees and firing them for good cause;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making necessary purchases, repairs, and replacements, provided that such expenditures in excess of five thousand dollars by a temporary manager appointed by the department must be approved by the department;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Entering into contracts necessary for the operation of the assisted living facility;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preserving resident trust funds and resident records; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preparing all department-required reports, including a detailed monthly accounting of all expenditures and liabilities, which shall be sent to the department and the licensee.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The licensee and department shall provide written notification immediately to all residents, resident representatives, interested family members, and the state long-term care ombuds program of the temporary management and the reasons for it. This notification shall include notice that residents may move from the assisted living facility without notifying the licensee or temporary manager in advance, and without incurring any charges, fees, or costs otherwise available for insufficient advance notice, during the temporary management period. The notification shall also inform residents and their families or representatives that the temporary management team will provide residents help with relocation and appropriate discharge planning and coordination if desired. The department shall provide assistance with relocation to residents who are department clients and may provide such assistance to other residents. The temporary manager shall meet regularly with staff, residents, residents' representatives, and families to inform them of the plans for and progress achieved in the correction of deficiencies, and of the plans for facility closure or continued operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall terminate temporary management:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>After sixty days unless good cause is shown to continue the temporary management. Good cause for continuing the temporary management exists when returning the assisted living facility to its former licensee would subject residents to a threat to health, safety, or welfare;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When all residents are transferred and the assisted living facility is closed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When deficiencies threatening residents' health, safety, or welfare are eliminated and the former licensee agrees to department-specified conditions regarding the continued facility operation; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a new licensee assumes control of the assisted living facility.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Nothing in this section precludes the department from revoking its approval of the temporary management or exercising its licensing enforcement authority under this chapter. The department's decision whether to approve or to revoke a temporary management arrangement is not subject to the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<p>The department shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless any temporary manager appointed or approved under this section against claims made against the temporary manager for any actions by the temporary manager or its agents that do not amount to intentional torts or criminal behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may adopt rules implementing this section. In the development of rules or policies implementing this section, the department shall consult with residents and their representatives, resident advocates, financial professionals, assisted living facility providers, and organizations representing assisted living facilities.</p>
