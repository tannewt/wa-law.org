<p>The legislature finds and declares that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As a result of COVID-19, Washington state schools are largely operating on a distance learning model and many citizens are working remotely. Communications networks, including both wired and wireless, have done much work to meet these growing needs, but additional work is required to facilitate widespread deployment of next-generation wireless and broadband network facilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wireless and broadband products and services are a significant and continually growing part of the state's economy. Accordingly, encouraging the development of strong and robust wireless and broadband communications networks throughout the state is integral to the state's economic competitiveness;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rapid deployment of small wireless facilities will serve numerous important statewide goals and the public policy, including: Meeting growing consumer demand for wireless data; increasing competitive options for communications services available to the state's residents; promoting the ability of the state's citizens to communicate with other citizens and with their schools, state, and local governments; and promoting public safety;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small wireless facilities, including facilities commonly referred to as small cells and distributed antenna systems, are deployed most effectively in the rights-of-way;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To meet the key objectives of this chapter and federal law, wireless providers must have access to the rights-of-way and the ability to attach to infrastructure in the rights-of-way to densify their networks and provide next-generation wireless services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rates and fees for the permitting and deployment of small wireless facilities in rights-of-way and on authority infrastructure, including poles, throughout the state, consistent with federal law, is reasonable and will encourage the development of robust next-generation wireless and broadband networks for the benefit of citizens throughout the state; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The procedures, rates, and fees in this chapter are consistent with federal law and are fair and reasonable when viewed from the perspective of the state's citizens and the state's interest in having robust, reliable, and technologically advanced wireless and broadband networks and reflect a balancing of the interests of the wireless providers deploying new facilities and the interests of authorities in recovering their costs of managing access to the rights-of-way and the attachment space provided on authority infrastructure in the rights-of-way.</p>

<h2 id="section-3-1644">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-1644">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This section applies to activities of a wireless provider within the rights-of-way to deploy small wireless facilities and associated poles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An authority may not enter into an exclusive arrangement with any person for use of the rights-of-way for the collocation of small wireless facilities or the installation, operation, marketing, modification, maintenance, or replacement of poles for such collocation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to this section, a wireless provider has the right, as a permitted use not subject to zoning review or approval, to collocate small wireless facilities and install, maintain, modify, operate, and replace poles along, across, upon, and under the rights-of-way. Such structures and facilities must be installed and maintained so as not to obstruct or hinder the usual travel or public safety on the rights-of-way or obstruct the legal use of the rights-of-way by utilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each new or modified pole installed in the rights-of-way for the purpose of collocation of small wireless facilities may not exceed the greater of: (a) 50 feet in height above ground level; or (b) ten percent taller than the tallest existing structure in place in the rights-of-way, as of the effective date of this section, located within 500 feet of the new structure in the same rights-of-way. A wireless provider has the right to collocate a small wireless facility and install, maintain, modify, operate, and replace a pole that exceeds these height limits along, across, upon, and under the rights-of-way, subject to this section and applicable zoning regulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An authority may adopt standards in its code governing the deployment of small wireless facilities and associated poles in the rights-of-way, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The aesthetic requirements must be: (i) Reasonable, in that they are technically feasible and reasonably directed to avoiding or remedying the intangible public harm of unsightly or out-of-character deployments; (ii) no more burdensome than those applied to other types of infrastructure deployments; and (iii) objective and published in advance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An authority may deny a permit for not complying with aesthetic requirements only if the authority has found that a denial does not create an effective prohibition of wireless services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aesthetic requirements applicable to deployment on decorative poles and in historic districts must also comply with the following requirements:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>A wireless provider must be permitted to collocate on or replace decorative poles when necessary to deploy a small wireless facility. An authority may require the collocation or decorative pole replacement to reasonably conform to the design aesthetics of the original decorative pole or poles, provided that these requirements are technically feasible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A wireless provider shall be permitted to collocate small wireless facilities or replace poles in historic districts. Consistent with this subsection, an authority may require design or concealment measures for small wireless facilities and associated poles in historic districts. Any such design or concealment measures may not be considered a part of the small wireless facility for purposes of the size parameters in the definition of small wireless facility. New poles must be permitted if collocation is not an option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A wireless provider must be permitted to place a new pole, subject to the terms of this subsection, where to deny placement of the new pole would be an effective prohibition of service.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A wireless provider must comply with undergrounding requirements where:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The authority has required all electric and communications lines to be placed underground by three months prior to the submission of the application;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Structures the authority allows to remain must be made available to wireless providers for the collocation of small wireless facilities, and may be replaced by a wireless provider to accommodate the collocation of small wireless facilities, in compliance with this chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A wireless provider may install a new pole in the designated area that otherwise complies with this section when it is not able to provide wireless services by collocating on a remaining pole or other structure; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For small wireless facilities installed before an authority adopts requirements that communications and electric lines be placed underground, an authority adopting such requirements must permit: (i) A wireless provider to maintain the small wireless facilities in place on any structure not required to be removed, subject to any applicable pole attachment agreement with the pole owner; or (ii) the wireless provider to replace an existing pole within 50 feet of the prior location.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority may require a wireless provider to repair all damage to the rights-of-way directly caused by the activities of the wireless provider in the rights-of-way and to return the rights-of-way to its functional equivalence before the damage pursuant to the competitively neutral, reasonable requirements and specifications of the authority. If the wireless provider fails to make the repairs required by the authority within a reasonable time after written notice, the authority may make those repairs and charge the applicable party the reasonable, documented cost of such repairs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A wireless provider may not be required to replace or upgrade an existing pole or the electrical components supporting the pole except for reasons of structural necessity or compliance with applicable codes. A wireless provider may, with the permission of the pole owner, replace or modify existing poles, but any such replacement or modification must be consistent with the design aesthetics of the pole being modified or replaced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A wireless provider is required to notify the authority at least 30 days before its abandonment of a small wireless facility. Following receipt of such a notice, the authority shall direct the wireless provider to remove all or any portion of the small wireless facility that the authority determines would be in the best interest of the public safety and public welfare to remove. If the wireless provider fails to remove the abandoned facility within 90 days after such a notice, the authority may undertake to do so and recover the actual and reasonable expenses of doing so from the wireless provider or its successors or assigns.</p>
