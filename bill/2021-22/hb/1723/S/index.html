<p>This act may be known and cited as the digital equity act.</p>
<h2 id="section-102-76">Section 102 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-102-76">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Access to the internet is essential to participating in modern day society including, but not limited to, attending school and work, accessing health care, paying for basic services, connecting with family and friends, civic participation, and economic survival.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For too many people in both rural and urban areas, the cost of being online is unaffordable. The legislature recognizes that building the last mile of broadband to the home is prohibitively expensive and that urban areas that are home to people earning low incomes continue to face digital redlining. Across the state there is a lack of affordable plans, barriers to enrolling in appropriate broadband plans, and barriers to fully utilize the opportunities that broadband offers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the need for affordable access, devices, and skills to use the internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The need for more accessible and affordable internet is felt more acutely among specific sectors of the population, especially Washington residents in rural areas, people who are currently earning low incomes, seniors and others who lack the skills necessary to get online, people with first languages other than English, immigrant communities, and people with disabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The federal government is allocating considerable sums for investment in digital equity that the state broadband office will help to leverage for residents across Washington. Continued comprehensive efforts, including coordination with tribal partners, are needed to ensure truly equitable access. The legislature recognizes that there will be a need for ongoing development and maintenance of broadband infrastructure. The legislature also recognizes that there is a need for ongoing outreach by community-based partnerships to provide enrollment assistance to lower the cost of internet subscriptions and devices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to broaden access to the internet, the appropriate devices, and the skills to operate online safely and effectively so that all people in Washington can fully participate in our society, democracy, and economy.</p>

<p>The commission shall annually adopt by rule those services, including prepaid services, that are eligible for inclusion in the Washington broadband assistance program established in section 202 of this act and the amount of assistance to be provided to low-income persons. The commission shall also adopt by rule guidelines to ensure reduction of barriers to enrollment. This may include allowing telecommunications providers with low-income internet offerings to provide an opt-in for new or existing low-income customers without additional verification if those low-income customers have already demonstrated eligibility in initial enrollment in a low-income internet offering. In determining the amount of assistance to be provided, the commission shall consider the number of low-income persons expected to participate, the price of eligible voice and broadband services, other assistance programs available to low-income persons, and other facts and circumstances that may bear on the reasonableness of assistance levels. The commission may by order exclude a telecommunications provider from the program if it determines the costs charged by the telecommunications provider to be excessive or the quality of service or customer service to be poor.</p>
