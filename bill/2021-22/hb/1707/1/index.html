<h2 id="section-1-2632">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-2632">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes that drowning is the most common cause of death of individuals engaging in recreational boating activities, including the use of kayaks, canoes, and stand-up paddleboards. The legislature also recognizes that although the wearing of a personal flotation device could prevent as many as half of all boating-related drowning deaths, fewer than 20 percent of adults wear a personal flotation device when engaging in recreational boating activities. The legislature finds that in circumstances where individuals are required by law to wear, and not just carry, personal flotation devices, there is a substantial increase in the number of individuals who wear personal flotation devices.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is the legislature's intent to reduce the number of drowning deaths by requiring all individuals to wear personal flotation devices when operating a kayak, canoe, or stand-up paddleboard on the waters of the state.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-2118">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-2118">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/79A_public_recreational_lands/79A.60_regulation_of_recreational_vessels.html">79A.60.160</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/79A_public_recreational_lands/79A.60_regulation_of_recreational_vessels.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>No person may operate or permit the operation of a vessel on the waters of the state without a personal flotation device on board for each person on the vessel. Each personal flotation device shall be in serviceable condition, of an appropriate size, and readily accessible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in RCW 79A.60.020, a violation of subsection (1) of this section is an infraction under chapter 7.84 RCW if the vessel is not carrying passengers for hire.</p>

<li>
<p>A violation of subsection (1) of this section is a misdemeanor punishable under RCW 9.92.030, if the vessel is carrying passengers for hire.</p>

For the purposes of this section, a personal flotation device is not considered readily accessible for children <strong>12</strong> years old and under unless the device is worn by the child while the vessel is underway. The personal flotation device must be worn at all times by a child <strong>12</strong> years old and under whenever the vessel is underway and the child is on an open deck or open cockpit of the vessel. The following circumstances are excepted:</p>

<p>Except as provided in RCW 79A.60.020, a violation of subsection (4) of this section is an infraction under chapter 7.84 RCW. Enforcement of subsection (4) of this section by law enforcement officers may be accomplished as a primary action, and need not be accompanied by the suspected violation of some other offense.</p>
