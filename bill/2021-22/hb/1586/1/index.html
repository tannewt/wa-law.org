<h2 id="section-1-1803">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1803">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that it is in the interest of the state to promote greater transparency from the persons and entities who seek to influence the passage of legislation by informing the public and news media of the sources and sponsorship of information that is designed to sway and procure political interest, allegiance, and active support to pass or defeat proposed legislation. This need for transparency requires the disclosure of those parties who sponsor grassroots efforts to influence legislation. The legislature finds that it has become common for powerful political and corporate interests to use grassroots movements to hide behind and further their own legislative agendas in a practice known as &quot;astroturfing.&quot; The legislature believes that Washington citizens have the right to know who is exerting influence on legislation in our state and whether the messages being conveyed to them are emanating from concerned citizens, nonprofits, political organizations, corporations, or other sources.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to require anyone who sponsors grassroots campaigns aimed at influencing legislation to file a report with the public disclosure commission within 24 hours of the first expenditure. The legislature finds that it is vital for transparency and trust in the legislative process and debate to also require disclosure of the names of the sponsors who paid over $1,000 for communications to the public. Prompt initial and weekly reports will ensure that the public, media, and legislators have an opportunity to determine who is responsible for lobbying efforts in the same manner that direct lobbying expenditures must be disclosed and campaign communications must reveal who is paying for them.</p>
