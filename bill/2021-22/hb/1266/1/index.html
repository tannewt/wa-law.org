<h2 id="section-1-2931">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-2931">¶</a></h2>
<p>When the legislature adopted chapter 13, Laws of 2017 3rd sp. sess., structural changes to compensation allocations were implemented including increases to better reflect comparable wages, changes to an average salary allocation instead of one based on the average years of experience and education for certificated staff in a district, and regionalization factors to reflect the varying costs of living in different regions of the state. In subsequent years, the experience mix factor has been created to reflect higher average salary cost in districts that have higher than average concentrations of staff with more years of experience and advanced educational attainment.</p>
<p>Chapter 13, Laws of 2017 3rd sp. sess. created a cycle for rebasing basic education salaries every four years to keep basic education salaries comparable to similar professions over time. The first rebase is scheduled for the 2023 legislative session, but the process and expectations for this review have not been outlined.</p>
<p>Compensation policies and the allocation of resources to districts are significant public policy areas which will benefit from insight from educators, administrators, community members, and state leaders. The legislature must examine how compensation policies impact and influence the makeup of the K-12 workforce and equity among districts. Districts without the same ability to raise local resources may face greater challenges recruiting and retaining educators. In addition, many educators of color serve on more committees to ensure diverse voices are at the table and take on additional mentorship roles for new educators and students. This can create a cultural taxation that adds work and responsibilities that are not compensated and can lead to greater burnout and turnover for educators of color.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature is establishing a K-12 basic education compensation advisory committee to provide input on issues related to the salary rebase process, comparable wages, and impact of regionalization, and to review the ways in which compensation policy can support equity and greater diversity in the education workforce.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.150_general_provisions.html">28A.150.412</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.150_general_provisions.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Beginning with the 2023 regular legislative session, and every four years thereafter, the legislature shall review and rebase state basic education compensation allocations compared to school district compensation data, regionalization factors, what inflationary measure is the most representative of actual market experience for school districts, and other economic information. The legislature shall revise the minimum allocations, regionalization factors, and inflationary measure if necessary to ensure that state basic education allocations continue to provide market-rate salaries**, attract and retain a diverse workforce,** and that regionalization adjustments reflect actual economic <strong>and recruiting</strong> differences between school districts. <strong>The legislature shall review the data and recommendations from the K-12 basic education compensation advisory committee created in section 3 of this act.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>For school districts with single-family residential values above the statewide median residential value, regionalization factors for school years 2018-19 through school year 2022-23 are as follows:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>For school districts in tercile 1, state salary allocations for school district employees are regionalized by six percent;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For school districts in tercile 2, state salary allocations for school district employees are regionalized by twelve percent; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For school districts in tercile 3, state salary allocations for school district employees are regionalized by eighteen percent.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the regionalization factors specified in (a) of this subsection, school districts located west of the crest of the Cascade mountains and sharing a boundary with any school district with a regionalization factor more than one tercile higher, are regionalized by six additional percentage points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the regionalization factors specified in this subsection, for school districts that have certificated instructional staff median years of experience that exceed the statewide average certificated instructional staff years of experience and a ratio of certificated instructional staff advanced degrees to bachelor degrees above the statewide ratio, an experience factor of four percentage points is added to the regionalization factor, beginning in the 2019-20 school year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional school district adjustments are identified in the omnibus appropriations act, and these adjustments are partially reduced or eliminated by the 2022-23 school year as follows:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Adjustments that increase the regionalization factor to a value that is greater than the tercile 3 regionalization factor must be reduced by two percentage points each school year beginning with school year 2020-21, through 2022-23.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjustments that increase the regionalization factor to a value that is less than or equal to the tercile 3 regionalization factor must be reduced by one percentage point each school year beginning with school year 2020-21, through 2022-23.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To aid the <strong>K-12 basic education compensation advisory committee established in section 3 of this act and the</strong> legislature in reviewing and rebasing regionalization factors, the department of revenue shall, by <strong>September 1, 2021</strong>, and by <strong>September</strong> 1st every four years thereafter, determine the median single-family residential value of each school district as well as the median value of proximate districts within fifteen miles of the boundary of the school district for which the median residential value is being calculated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No district may receive less state funding for the minimum state salary allocation as compared to its prior school year salary allocation as a result of adjustments that reflect updated regionalized salaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Median residential value of each school district&quot; means the median value of all single-family residential parcels included within a school district and any other school district that is proximate to the school district.</p>

<p>&quot;Proximate to the school district&quot; means within fifteen miles of the boundary of the school district for which the median residential value is being calculated.</p>
