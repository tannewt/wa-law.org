[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/House%20Bills/1329-S.xml)
## Section 1
The legislature finds people participating in their government, especially through public comment, is an essential part of developing public policy. The legislature further finds that there are numerous developing technologies that can be used to facilitate public comment, especially for those with disabilities, underserved communities, and those who face time or distance challenges when traveling to public meetings. Therefore, the legislature intends to encourage public agencies to make use of remote access tools as fully as practicable to encourage public engagement and better serve their communities.

## Section 2
> This section modifies existing section [42.30.010](/rcw/42_public_officers_and_agencies/42.30_open_public_meetings_act.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/42_public_officers_and_agencies/42.30_open_public_meetings_act.md) for context.

The legislature finds and declares that all public commissions, boards, councils, committees, subcommittees, departments, divisions, offices, and all other public agencies of this state and subdivisions thereof exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business. It is the intent of this chapter that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly.

The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed **and informing the people's public servants of their views** so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created. **For these reasons, even when not required by law, public agencies are encouraged to incorporate and accept public comment during their decision-making process.**


## Section 3
> This section modifies existing section [42.30.030](/rcw/42_public_officers_and_agencies/42.30_open_public_meetings_act.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/42_public_officers_and_agencies/42.30_open_public_meetings_act.md) for context.

1. All meetings of the governing body of a public agency shall be open and public and all persons shall be permitted to attend any meeting of the governing body of a public agency, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.

2. **Public agencies are encouraged to provide for the increased ability of the public to observe and participate in the meetings of governing bodies through real-time telephonic, electronic, internet, or other readily available means of remote access that do not require an additional cost to access the meeting.**


## Section 5
> This section modifies existing section [42.30.110](/rcw/42_public_officers_and_agencies/42.30_open_public_meetings_act.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/42_public_officers_and_agencies/42.30_open_public_meetings_act.md) for context.

1. Nothing contained in this chapter may be construed to prevent a governing body from holding an executive session during a regular or special meeting:

    a. [Empty]

        i. To consider matters affecting national security;

        ii. To consider, if in compliance with any required data security breach disclosure under RCW 19.255.010 and 42.56.590, and with legal counsel available, information regarding the infrastructure and security of computer and telecommunications networks, security and service recovery plans, security risk assessments and security test results to the extent that they identify specific system vulnerabilities, and other information that if made public may increase the risk to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of agency security or to information technology infrastructure or assets;

    b. To consider the selection of a site or the acquisition of real estate by lease or purchase when public knowledge regarding such consideration would cause a likelihood of increased price;

    e. To consider, in the case of an export trading company, financial and commercial information supplied by private persons to the export trading company;

    i. To discuss with legal counsel representing the agency matters relating to agency enforcement actions, or to discuss with legal counsel representing the agency litigation or potential litigation to which the agency, the governing body, or a member acting in an official capacity is, or is likely to become, a party, when public knowledge regarding the discussion is likely to result in an adverse legal or financial consequence to the agency.

        i. Litigation that has been specifically threatened to which the agency, the governing body, or a member acting in an official capacity is, or is likely to become, a party;

        ii. Litigation that the agency reasonably believes may be commenced by or against the agency, the governing body, or a member acting in an official capacity; or

        iii. Litigation or legal risks of a proposed action or current practice that the agency has identified when public discussion of the litigation or legal risks is likely to result in an adverse legal or financial consequence to the agency;

    j. To consider, in the case of the state library commission or its advisory bodies, western library network prices, products, equipment, and services, when such discussion would be likely to adversely affect the network's ability to conduct business in a competitive economic climate.

    m. To consider in the case of the life sciences discovery fund authority, the substance of grant applications and grant awards when public knowledge regarding the discussion would reasonably be expected to result in private loss to the providers of this information;

    n. To consider in the case of a health sciences and services authority, the substance of grant applications and grant awards when public knowledge regarding the discussion would reasonably be expected to result in private loss to the providers of this information;
