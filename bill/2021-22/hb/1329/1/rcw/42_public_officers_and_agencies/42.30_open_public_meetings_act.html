<p>The legislature finds and declares that all public commissions, boards, councils, committees, subcommittees, departments, divisions, offices, and all other public agencies of this state and subdivisions thereof exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business. It is the intent of this chapter that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly.</p>
<p>The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed <strong>and informing the people's public servants of their views before significant final actions are taken</strong> so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created. <strong>For these reasons, even when not required by law, public agencies are encouraged to incorporate and accept public comment at all stages of their decision-making process.</strong></p>
