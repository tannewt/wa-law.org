## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. The right to vote is enshrined as one of the greatest virtues of our constitutional republic, and an engaged citizenry is essential at each level of government to ensure that all voices are heard; and

    b. State and local governments should take every step possible to make it easier to vote in Washington state and to ensure that the fundamental values of true democratic elections with full participation remains one of our most important functions. Providing additional opportunities for people to register to vote and helping them make their own choices about who represents them and about important issues that are central to their lives and communities is essential to upholding these values.

2. Therefore, the legislature intends to increase the opportunity to register to vote for persons qualified under Article VI of the Washington state Constitution by expanding the streamlined voter registration process, which will increase opportunities for voter registration without placing new undue burdens on government agencies.
