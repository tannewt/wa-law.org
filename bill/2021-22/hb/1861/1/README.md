# House Bill 1861

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/House%20Bills/1861.xml)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that persistent and disproportionate wealth inequities exist in Washington state. As wealth is the key indicator of long-term economic stability and well-being, those born into families of limited means face additional and substantial barriers to accessing reliable pathways out of poverty such as owning a home, completing postsecondary education, or starting a small business. The legislature declares that it is the public policy of the state and a recognized governmental function to assist individuals who are born into families of limited means to overcome economic and other disadvantages that would otherwise limit their opportunities as adults, making them better able to contribute to the general welfare.

Nearly half of all births in Washington state occur with a public subsidy from apple health. This indicates that a significant population of Washingtonians are born every year without financial stability.

The legislature recognizes that the effects of economic hardship are well-documented. Poverty causes negative outcomes for children, adults, and families. Further, financial hardship to individuals can result in state expenditures that could have been avoided if affected individuals were empowered to be more financially independent.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish a Washington future fund trust fund program housed in the office of the state treasurer to provide a sum of money in a savings and investment account for individuals who are born into families of limited means, to assist them in pursuing opportunities for education, housing, and entrepreneurship by starting a small business. The legislature also intends for this chapter to create opportunities that will foster financial independence and correspondingly reduce the need for certain state support.
