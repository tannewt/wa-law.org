<li>
<p>&quot;Underinsured motor vehicle&quot; means a motor vehicle with respect to the ownership, maintenance, or use of which either no bodily injury or property damage liability bond or insurance policy applies at the time of an accident, or with respect to which the sum of the limits of liability under all bodily injury or property damage liability bonds and insurance policies applicable to a covered person after an accident is less than the applicable damages which the covered person is legally entitled to recover.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No new policy or renewal of an existing policy insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury, death, or property damage, suffered by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle shall be issued with respect to any motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this state unless coverage is provided therein or supplemental thereto for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of underinsured motor vehicles, hit-and-run motor vehicles, and phantom vehicles because of bodily injury, death, or property damage, resulting therefrom, except while operating or occupying a motorcycle or motor-driven cycle, and except while operating or occupying a motor vehicle owned or available for the regular use by the named insured or any family member, and which is not insured under the liability coverage of the policy. The coverage required to be offered under this chapter is not applicable to general liability policies, commonly known as umbrella policies, or other policies which apply only as excess to the insurance directly applicable to the vehicle insured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as to property damage, coverage required under subsection (2) of this section shall be in the same amount as the insured's third party liability coverage unless the insured rejects all or part of the coverage as provided in subsection (4) of this section. Coverage for property damage need only be issued in conjunction with coverage for bodily injury or death. Property damage coverage required under subsection (2) of this section shall mean physical damage to the insured motor vehicle unless the policy specifically provides coverage for the contents thereof or other forms of property damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A named insured or spouse may reject, in writing, underinsured coverage for bodily injury or death, or property damage, and the requirements of subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall not apply. If a named insured or spouse has rejected underinsured coverage, such coverage shall not be included in any supplemental or renewal policy unless a named insured or spouse subsequently requests such coverage in writing. The requirement of a written rejection under this subsection shall apply only to the original issuance of policies issued after July 24, 1983, and not to any renewal or replacement policy. When a named insured or spouse chooses a property damage coverage that is less than the insured's third party liability coverage for property damage, a written rejection is not required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The limit of liability under the policy coverage may be defined as the maximum limits of liability for all damages resulting from any one accident regardless of the number of covered persons, claims made, or vehicles or premiums shown on the policy, or premiums paid, or vehicles involved in an accident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The policy may provide that if an injured person has other similar insurance available to him or her under other policies, the total limits of liability of all coverages shall not exceed the higher of the applicable limits of the respective coverages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The policy may provide for a deductible of not more than three hundred dollars for payment for property damage when the damage is caused by a hit-and-run driver or a phantom vehicle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In all other cases of underinsured property damage coverage, the policy may provide for a deductible of not more than one hundred dollars.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this chapter, a &quot;phantom vehicle&quot; shall mean a motor vehicle which causes bodily injury, death, or property damage to an insured and has no physical contact with the insured or the vehicle which the insured is occupying at the time of the accident if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The facts of the accident can be corroborated by competent evidence other than the testimony of the insured or any person having an underinsured motorist claim resulting from the accident; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The accident has been reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency within seventy-two hours of the accident.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An insurer who elects to write motorcycle or motor-driven cycle insurance in this state must provide information to prospective insureds about the coverage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An insurer who elects to write motorcycle or motor-driven cycle insurance in this state must provide an opportunity for named insureds, who have purchased liability coverage for a motorcycle or motor-driven cycle, to reject underinsured coverage for that motorcycle or motor-driven cycle in writing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the covered person seeking underinsured motorist coverage under this section was the intended victim of the tort feasor, the incident must be reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency and the covered person must cooperate with any related law enforcement investigation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose of this section is to protect innocent victims of motorists of underinsured motor vehicles. Covered persons are entitled to coverage without regard to whether an incident was intentionally caused. However, a person is not entitled to coverage if the insurer can demonstrate that the covered person intended to cause the event for which a claim is made under the coverage described in this section. As used in this section, and in the section of policies providing the underinsured motorist coverage described in this section, &quot;accident&quot; means an occurrence that is unexpected and unintended from the standpoint of the covered person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The coverage under this section may be excluded as provided for under RCW 48.177.010(6).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Underinsured coverage,&quot; for the purposes of this section, means coverage for &quot;underinsured motor vehicles,&quot; as defined in subsection (1) of this section.</p>

<li>
<p>The term &quot;underinsured motor vehicles&quot; with reference to coverage offered under any insurance policy regulated under this chapter shall, subject to the terms and conditions of such coverage, be deemed to include an insured motor vehicle where the liability insurer thereof is unable to make payment with respect to the legal liability of its insured within the limits specified therein because of insolvency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An insurer's insolvency protection shall be applicable only to accidents occurring during a policy period in which its insured's underinsured motorist coverage is in effect where the liability insurer of the tort-feasor becomes insolvent within three years after such an accident. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent any insurer from affording insolvency protection under terms and conditions more favorable to its insureds than is provided hereunder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the event of payment to an insured under the coverage required by this chapter and subject to the terms and conditions of such coverage, the insurer making such payment shall, to the extent thereof, be entitled to the proceeds of any settlement or judgment resulting from the exercise of any rights of recovery of such insured against any person or organization legally responsible for the bodily injury, death, or property damage for which such payment is made, including the proceeds recoverable from the assets of the insolvent insurer. Whenever an insurer shall make payment under the coverage required by this section and which payment is occasioned by an insolvency, such insurer's right of recovery or reimbursement shall not include any rights against the insured of said insolvent insurer for any amounts which would have been paid by the insolvent insurer. Such paying insurer shall have the right to proceed directly against the insolvent insurer or its receiver, and in pursuance of such right such paying insurer shall possess any rights which the insured of the insolvent company might otherwise have had, if the insured of the insolvent insurer had personally made the payment.</p>

<p>The bylaws and method of operation of any market assistance plan shall be approved by the commissioner prior to its operation.</p>
<p>A market assistance plan shall have a minimum of twenty-five insurers willing to insure risks within the class designated by the commissioner. If twenty-five insurers do not voluntarily agree to participate, the commissioner may require casualty insurers to participate in a market assistance plan as a condition of continuing to do business in this state. The commissioner shall make such a requirement to fulfill the quota of at least twenty-five insurers.

Secs. 901 through 950, and maritime employer's liability coverage incidental to the workers' compensation coverage is available to those unable to purchase it through the normal insurance market. This plan shall require the participation of all authorized insurers writing primary or excess United States longshore and harbor workers' compensation insurance in the state of Washington and the Washington state industrial insurance fund as defined in RCW 51.08.175 which is authorized to participate in the plan and to make payments in support of the plan in accordance with this section. Any underwriting losses or surpluses incurred by the plan shall be determined by the governing committee of the plan and shall be shared by plan participants in accordance with the following ratios: The state industrial insurance fund, fifty percent; and authorized insurers writing primary or excess United States longshore and harbor workers' compensation insurance, fifty percent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Washington state industrial insurance fund may obtain or provide reinsurance coverage for the plan created under subsection (1) of this section the terms of which shall be negotiated between the state fund and the plan. This coverage shall not be obtained or provided if the commissioner determines that the premium to be charged would result in unaffordable rates for coverage provided by the plan. In considering whether excess of loss coverage premiums would result in unaffordable rates for workers' compensation coverage provided by the plan, the commissioner shall compare the resulting plan rates to those provided under any similar pool or plan of other states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An applicant for plan insurance, a person insured under the plan, or an insurer, affected by a ruling or decision of the manager or committee designated to operate the plan may appeal to the commissioner for resolution of a dispute. In adopting rules under this section, the commissioner shall require that the plan use generally accepted actuarial principles for rate making.</p>
