<p>A district may improve its lands by dredging, filling, bulkheading, providing waterways or otherwise developing such lands for industrial and commercial purposes. A district may also acquire, construct, install, improve, and operate sewer and water utilities to serve its own property and other property owners under terms, conditions, and rates to be fixed and approved by the port commission. A district may also acquire, by purchase, construction, lease, or in any other manner, and may maintain and operate other facilities for the control or elimination of air, water, or other pollution, including, but not limited to, facilities for the treatment and/or disposal of industrial wastes, and may make such facilities available to others under terms, conditions and rates to be fixed and approved by the port commission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such conditions and rates shall be sufficient to reimburse the port for all costs, including reasonable amortization of capital outlays caused by or incidental to providing such other pollution control facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No part of such costs of providing any pollution control facility to others shall be paid out of any tax revenues of the port.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No port shall enter into an agreement or contract to provide sewer and/or water utilities or pollution control facilities if substantially similar utilities or facilities are available from another source (or sources) which is able and willing to provide such utilities or facilities on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis unless such other source (or sources) consents thereto.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the event that a port elects to make such other pollution control facilities available to others, it shall do so by lease, lease-purchase agreement, or other agreement binding such user to pay for the use of said facilities for the full term of the revenue bonds issued by the port for the acquisition of said facilities, and said payments shall at least fully reimburse the port for all principal and interest paid by it on said bonds and for all operating or other costs, if any, incurred by the port in connection with said facilities. However, where there is more than one user of any such facilities, each user shall be responsible for its pro rata share of such costs and payment of principal and interest. Any port intending to provide pollution control facilities to others shall first survey the port district to ascertain the potential users of such facilities and the extent of their needs. The port shall conduct a public hearing upon the proposal and shall give each potential user an opportunity to participate in the use of such facilities upon equal terms and conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Pollution control facility,&quot; as used in this section and RCW 53.08.041, includes programs and activities that are intended to reduce air pollution from vehicles used in cargo transport to, from, and within district facilities; and programs and activities that are intended to reduce air pollution from cargo vessels within the district. Use of district funds for these purposes are deemed a governmental and public function, exercised for a public purpose and as a public necessity for promoting cleaner air; provided however, the provisions of subsections (2), (3), (4), and (5) of this section relating to condition, rates, other providers, and cost recovery do not apply to this subsection's subset of port pollution control facilities.</p>

<p>Subject to chapter 48.62 RCW, the port commission shall have authority to provide or pay such benefits directly, or to provide for such benefits by the purchase of insurance policies or entering into contracts with and compensating any person, firm, agency or organization furnishing such benefits, or by making contributions to vacation plans or funds, or health and welfare plans and funds, or pension plans or funds, or similar plans or funds, already established by other employers of similar employees and in which the port district is permitted to participate for particular classifications of its employees by the trustees or other persons responsible for the administration of such established plans or funds: PROVIDED FURTHER, That no port district employee shall be allowed to apply for admission to or be accepted as a member of the state employees' retirement system after January 1, 1965, if admission to such system would result in coverage under both a private pension system and the state employees' retirement system, it being the purpose of this proviso that port districts shall not at the same time contribute for any employee to both a private pension or retirement plan and to the state employees' retirement system. The port commission shall have authority by resolution to utilize and compensate agents for the purpose of paying, in the name and by the check of such agent or agents or otherwise, wages, salaries and other benefits to employees, or particular classifications thereof, and for the purpose of withholding payroll taxes and paying over tax moneys so withheld to appropriate government agencies, on a combined basis with the wages, salaries, benefits, or taxes of other employers or otherwise; to enter into such contracts and arrangements with and to transfer by warrant such funds from time to time to any such agent or agents so appointed as are necessary to accomplish such salary, wage, benefit, or tax payments as though the port district were a private employer, notwithstanding any other provision of the law to the contrary. The funds of a port district transferred to such an agent or agents for the payment of wages or salaries of its employees in the name or by the check of such agent or agents shall be subject to garnishment with respect to salaries or wages so paid, notwithstanding any provision of the law relating to municipal corporations to the contrary.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any provision in this section, the governing body of a port district may enter into an agreement in writing with one or more of its officers or employees or a group of such officers and employees, authorizing deductions from the officer's or employee's salary or wages of the amount of any premium specified in writing by the officer or employee, for contribution to any private pension plan, without loss of eligibility for membership in the state employees' retirement system, and may agree to remit that amount to the management of such private pension plan. However, no port district funds shall be contributed or paid to such private plan. When such authorized deductions are certified by the port commission to the port district's auditor, the auditor shall draw and issue a proper warrant or warrants, or check or checks if that method of payment is authorized by statute, directly to and in favor of the person, firm, corporation, or organization named in the authorization, for the total amount authorized to be deducted from the payroll, together with a list identifying the officers and employees for whom the payment is made.</p>
<p>Nothing in this section may be invoked to invalidate any private pension plan or any public or private contributions or payments thereto, or exclude members of any such private pension plan from membership in the state employees' retirement system, if such private plan was in operation on December 31, 2001.</p>

<p>A moorage facility operator may adopt all rules necessary for rental and use of moorage facilities and for the expeditious collection of port charges.

<ol>
<li>
<p>Procedures authorizing moorage facility personnel to take reasonable measures, including the use of chains, ropes, and locks, or removal from the water, to secure vessels within the moorage facility so that the vessels are in the possession and control of the moorage facility operator and cannot be removed from the moorage facility. These procedures may be used if an owner mooring or storing a vessel at the moorage facility fails, after being notified that charges are owing and of the owner's right to commence legal proceedings to contest that such charges are owing, to pay the port charges owed or to commence legal proceedings. Notification shall be by registered mail to the owner at his or her last known address. In the case of a transient vessel, or where no address was furnished by the owner, the moorage facility operator need not give such notice prior to securing the vessel. At the time of securing the vessel, an authorized moorage facility employee shall attach to the vessel a readily visible notice. The notice shall be of a reasonable size and shall contain the following information:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The date and time the notice was attached;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A statement that if the account is not paid in full within ninety days from the time the notice is attached, the vessel may be sold at public auction to satisfy the port charges; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The address and telephone number where additional information may be obtained concerning release of the vessel.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After a vessel is secured, the operator shall make a reasonable effort to notify the owner by registered mail in order to give the owner the information contained in the notice.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Procedures authorizing moorage facility personnel at their discretion to move moored vessels ashore for storage within properties under the operator's control or for storage with private persons under their control as bailees of the moorage facility, if the vessel is, in the opinion of port personnel a nuisance, if the vessel is in danger of sinking or creating other damage, or is owing port charges. Costs of any such procedure shall be paid by the vessel's owner. If the owner is not known, or unable to reimburse the moorage facility operator for the costs of these procedures, the mooring facility operators may seek reimbursement of ninety percent of all reasonable and auditable costs from the derelict vessel removal account established in RCW 79.100.100.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a vessel is secured under subsection (1) of this section or moved ashore under subsection (2) of this section, the owner who is obligated to the moorage facility operator for port charges may regain possession of the vessel by:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Making arrangements satisfactory with the moorage facility operator for the immediate removal of the vessel from the moorage facility or for authorized moorage; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making payment to the moorage facility operator of all port charges, or by posting with the moorage facility operator a sufficient cash bond or other acceptable security, to be held in trust by the moorage facility operator pending written agreement of the parties with respect to payment by the vessel owner of the amount owing, or pending resolution of the matter of the charges in a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction. After entry of judgment, including any appeals, in a court of competent jurisdiction, or after the parties reach agreement with respect to payment, the trust shall terminate and the moorage facility operator shall receive so much of the bond or other security as is agreed, or as is necessary to satisfy any judgment, costs, and interest as may be awarded to the moorage facility operator. The balance shall be refunded immediately to the owner at his or her last known address.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a vessel has been secured by the moorage facility operator under subsection (1) of this section and is not released to the owner under the bonding provisions of this section within ninety days after notifying or attempting to notify the owner under subsection (1) of this section, the vessel shall be conclusively presumed to have been abandoned by the owner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a vessel moored or stored at a moorage facility is abandoned, the moorage facility operator may, by resolution of its legislative authority, authorize the public sale of the vessel by authorized personnel to the highest and best bidder for cash as prescribed by this subsection (5). Either a minimum bid may be established or a letter of credit may be required, or both, to discourage the future reabandonment of the vessel.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Before the vessel is sold, the owner of the vessel shall be given at least twenty days' notice of the sale in the manner set forth in subsection (1) of this section if the name and address of the owner is known. The notice shall contain the time and place of the sale, a reasonable description of the vessel to be sold, and the amount of port charges owed with respect to the vessel. The notice of sale shall be published at least once, more than ten but not more than twenty days before the sale, in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the moorage facility is located. Such notice shall include the name of the vessel, if any, the last known owner and address, and a reasonable description of the vessel to be sold. The moorage facility operator may bid all or part of its port charges at the sale and may become a purchaser at the sale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before the vessel is sold, any person seeking to redeem an impounded vessel under this section may commence a lawsuit in the superior court for the county in which the vessel was impounded to contest the validity of the impoundment or the amount of the port charges owing. Such lawsuit must be commenced within ten days of the date the notification was provided pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, or the right to a hearing shall be deemed waived and the owner shall be liable for any port charges owing the moorage facility operator. In the event of litigation, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proceeds of a sale under this section shall first be applied to the payment of port charges. The balance, if any, shall be paid to the owner. If the owner cannot in the exercise of due diligence be located by the moorage facility operator within one year of the date of the sale, the excess funds from the sale shall revert to the derelict vessel removal account established in RCW 79.100.100. If the sale is for a sum less than the applicable port charges, the moorage facility operator is entitled to assert a claim for a deficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the event no one purchases the vessel at a sale, or a vessel is not removed from the premises or other arrangements are not made within ten days of sale, title to the vessel will revert to the moorage facility operator.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rules authorized under this section shall be enforceable only if the moorage facility has had its tariff containing such rules conspicuously posted at its moorage facility at all times.</p>
