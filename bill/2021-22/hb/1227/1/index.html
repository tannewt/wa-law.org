<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that children and families are better served when the state provides support to allow children to be cared for by their loved ones and in their communities. The legislature finds that decades of research show that Black and Indigenous children are still disproportionately removed from their families and communities despite reform efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For these reasons, it is the intent of the legislature to safely reduce the number of children in foster care and reduce racial bias in the system by applying a standard criteria for determining whether to remove a child from a parent when necessary to prevent imminent physical harm to the child due to child abuse or neglect.</p>

<p>The written notice of custody and rights required by this section shall be in substantially the following form:</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&quot;NOTICE</p>
<p>Your child has been placed in temporary custody under the supervision of Child Protective Services (or other person or agency). You have important legal rights and you must take steps to protect your interests.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A court hearing will be held before a judge within 72 hours of the time your child is taken into custody excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. You should call the court at <strong>. . . (insert appropriate phone number here)</strong> for specific information about the date, time, and location of the court hearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have the right to have a lawyer represent you at the hearing. Your right to representation continues after the shelter care hearing. You have the right to records the department intends to rely upon. A lawyer can look at the files in your case, talk to child protective services and other agencies, tell you about the law, help you understand your rights, and help you at hearings. If you cannot afford a lawyer, the court will appoint one to represent you. To get a court-appointed lawyer you must contact: <strong>. . . (explain local procedure)</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the hearing, you have the right to speak on your own behalf, to introduce evidence, to examine witnesses, and to receive a decision based solely on the evidence presented to the judge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your hearing occurs before a court commissioner, you have the right to have the decision of the court commissioner reviewed by a superior court judge. To obtain that review, you must, within ten days after the entry of the decision of the court commissioner, file with the court a motion for revision of the decision, as provided in RCW 2.24.050.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You should be present at any shelter care hearing. If you do not come, the judge will not hear what you have to say.</p>
<p>You may call the Child Protective Services' caseworker for more information about your child. The caseworker's name and telephone number are: <strong>. . . (insert name and telephone number)</strong>.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>You have a right to a case conference to develop a written service agreement following the shelter care hearing. The service agreement may not conflict with the court's order of shelter care. You may request that a multidisciplinary team, family group conference, or prognostic staffing be convened for your child's case. You may participate in these processes with your counsel present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your child is placed in the custody of the department of children, youth, and families or other  agency, immediately following the shelter care hearing, the court will enter an order granting the department or other  agency the right to inspect and copy all health, medical, mental health, and education records of the child, directing health care providers to release such information without your further consent, and granting the department or  agency or its designee the authority and responsibility, where applicable, to:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notify the child's school that the child is in out-of-home placement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enroll the child in school;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request the school transfer records;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request and authorize evaluation of special needs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attend parent or teacher conferences;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excuse absences;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grant permission for extracurricular activities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authorize medications which need to be administered during school hours and sign for medical needs that arise during school hours; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete or update school emergency records.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court decides to place your child in the custody of the department of children, youth, and families or other  agency, the department or agency will create a permanency plan for your child, including a primary placement goal and secondary placement goal. The department or agency also will recommend that the court order services for your child and for you, if needed. The department or agency is required to make reasonable efforts to provide you with services to address your parenting problems, and to provide you with visitation with your child according to court orders. Failure to promptly engage in services or to maintain contact with your child may lead to the filing of a petition to terminate your parental rights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Primary and secondary permanency plans are intended to run at the same time so that your child will have a permanent home as quickly as possible. Absent good cause, and when appropriate, the department or other  agency must follow the wishes of a natural parent regarding placement of a child. You should tell your lawyer and the court where you wish your child placed immediately, including whether you want your child placed with you, with a relative, or with another suitable person. You also should tell your lawyer and the court what services you feel are necessary and your wishes regarding visitation with your child. Even if you want another parent or person to be the primary placement choice for your child, you should tell your lawyer, the department or other  agency, and the court if you want to be a secondary placement option, and you should comply with court orders for services and participate in visitation with your child. Early and consistent involvement in your child's case plan is important for the well-being of your child.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A dependency petition begins a judicial process, which, if the court finds your child dependent, could result in substantial restrictions including, the entry or modification of a parenting plan or residential schedule, previously existing nonparental custody order or decree, guardianship order, or permanent loss of your parental rights.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Upon receipt of the written notice, the parent, guardian, or legal custodian shall acknowledge such notice by signing a receipt prepared by child protective services. If the parent, guardian, or legal custodian does not sign the receipt, the reason for lack of a signature shall be written on the receipt. The receipt shall be made a part of the court's file in the dependency action.</p>
<p>If after making reasonable efforts to provide notification, child protective services is unable to determine the whereabouts of the parents, guardian, or legal custodian, the notice shall be delivered or sent to the last known address of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>If child protective services is not required to give notice under this section, the juvenile court counselor assigned to the matter shall make all <strong>diligent</strong> efforts to advise the parents, guardian, or legal custodian of the time and place of any shelter care hearing, request that they be present, and inform them of their basic rights as provided in RCW 13.34.090.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diligent</strong> efforts to advise and to give notice, as required in this section, shall include, at a minimum, investigation of the whereabouts of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian. If such <strong>diligent</strong> efforts are not successful, or the parent, guardian, or legal custodian does not appear at the shelter care hearing, the petitioner shall testify at the hearing or state in a declaration:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The efforts made to investigate the whereabouts of, and to advise, the parent, guardian, or custodian; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether actual advice of rights was made, to whom it was made, and how it was made, including the substance of any oral communication or copies of written materials used.</p>

The person must be willing and available to care for the child and be able to meet any special needs of the child and the court must <strong>complete the inquiry required under RCW 13.34.065 to establish whether continued placement with the relative is appropriate</strong>. The person must be willing to facilitate the child's visitation with siblings, if such visitation is part of the <strong>department's</strong> plan or is ordered by the court. If a child is not initially placed with a relative or other suitable person requested by the parent pursuant to this section, the <strong>department</strong> shall make <strong>continuing efforts</strong> to place the child with a relative or other suitable person requested by the parent on the next business day after the child is taken into custody.

<p>The court shall release a child alleged to be dependent to the care, custody, and control of the child's parent, guardian, or legal custodian unless the court finds <strong>by a preponderance of the evidence</strong> that:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>After consideration of the specific services that have been provided, reasonable efforts have been made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from the child's home and to make it possible for the child to return home; and</li>

</li>
</ol>
<p>(B) (I) <strong>Removal of the child is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm due to child abuse or neglect</strong>, notwithstanding an order entered pursuant to RCW 26.44.063**. The evidence must show a causal relationship between the particular conditions in the home and imminent physical harm to the child. The existence of community or family poverty, isolation, single parenthood, age of the parent, crowded or inadequate housing, substance abuse, prenatal drug or alcohol exposure, mental illness, disability or special needs of the parent or child, or nonconforming social behavior does not by itself constitute imminent physical harm;**</p>
<p>(II) <strong>It is contrary to the welfare of the child to be returned home; and</strong></p>
<p>(III) <strong>After considering the particular circumstances of the child, any imminent physical harm to the child outweighs the harm the child will experience as a result of removal</strong>; or</p>
<p>(C) The parent, guardian, or custodian to whom the child could be released has been charged with violating RCW 9A.40.060 or 9A.40.070.</p>
<pre><code>b. **If the court finds that the elements of (a)(ii)(B) of this subsection require removal of the child, the court shall further consider:**

    i. **Whether participation by the parents, guardians, or legal custodians in any supportive services would prevent or eliminate the need for removal and, if so, shall inquire of the parent whether they are willing to participate in such services. If the parent agrees to participate in the supportive services identified by the court that would prevent or eliminate the need for removal, the court shall place the child with the parent. The court shall not order a parent to participate in supportive services over the objection of the parent, however, parents shall have the opportunity to consult with counsel prior to deciding whether to agree to proposed supportive services as a condition of having the child return to or remain in the care of the parent; and**

    ii. **Whether the issuance of a temporary order of protection directing the removal of a person or persons from the child's residence would prevent the need for removal of the child.**

c. [Empty]

    i. If the court does not release the child to his or her parent, guardian, or legal custodian, the court shall order placement with a relative or other suitable person as described in RCW 13.34.130(1)(b), unless **the petitioner establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that:**
</code></pre>
<p>(A) <strong>Placement in licensed foster care is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm to the child due to child abuse or neglect because no relative or other suitable person is capable of ensuring the basic safety of the child; or</strong></p>
<p>(B) <strong>The</strong> efforts to reunite the parent and child will be hindered.</p>
<pre><code>    ii. **In making the determination in (c)(i) of this subsection, the court shall:**
</code></pre>
<p>(A) <strong>Inquire of the petitioner and any other person present at the hearing for the child whether there are any relatives or other suitable persons who are willing to care for the child. This inquiry must include whether any relative or other suitable person:</strong></p>
<p>(I) <strong>Has expressed an interest in becoming a caregiver for the child;</strong></p>
<p>(II) <strong>Is able to meet any special needs of the child;</strong></p>
<p>(III) <strong>Is willing to facilitate the child's sibling and parent visitation if such visitation is ordered by the court; and</strong></p>
<p>(IV) <strong>Supports reunification of the parent and child once reunification can safely occur; and</strong></p>
<p>(B) <strong>Give great weight to the stated preference of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian, and the child.</strong></p>
<pre><code>    iii. **If a relative or other suitable person expressed an interest in caring for the child, can meet the child's special needs, can support parent-child reunification, and will facilitate court-ordered sibling or parent visitation, the following must not prevent the child's placement with such relative or other suitable person:**
</code></pre>
<p>(A) <strong>An incomplete department or fingerprint-based background check, if such relative or other suitable person appears otherwise suitable and competent to provide care and treatment, but the background checks must be completed as soon as possible after placement;</strong></p>
<p>(B) <strong>Uncertainty on the part of the relative or other suitable person regarding potential adoption of the child;</strong></p>
<p>(C) <strong>Disbelief on the part of the relative or other suitable person that the parent presents a danger to the child; or</strong></p>
<p>(D) <strong>The conditions of the relative or other suitable person's home are not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of a licensed foster home. The court may order the department to provide financial or other support to the relative or other suitable person necessary to ensure safe conditions in the home.</strong></p>
<pre><code>d. If the child was not initially placed with a relative or other suitable person, and the court does not release the child to his or her parent, guardian, or legal custodian, the department shall make reasonable efforts to locate a relative or other suitable person pursuant to RCW 13.34.060(1).

e. **If the court does not order placement with a relative or other suitable person, the court shall place the child in licensed foster care** and shall set forth its reasons for the order. If the court orders placement of the child with a person not related to the child and not licensed to provide foster care, the placement is subject to all terms and conditions of this section that apply to relative placements.

f. Any placement with a relative, or other suitable person approved by the court pursuant to this section, shall be contingent upon cooperation with the department's or agency's case plan and compliance with court orders related to the care and supervision of the child including, but not limited to, court orders regarding parent-child contacts, sibling contacts, and any other conditions imposed by the court. Noncompliance with the case plan or court order is grounds for removal of the child from the home of the relative or other suitable person, subject to review by the court.

g. If the child is placed in a qualified residential treatment program as defined in this chapter, the court shall, within sixty days of placement, hold a hearing to:

    i. Consider the assessment required under RCW 13.34.420 and submitted as part of the department's social study, and any related documentation;

    ii. Determine whether placement in foster care can meet the child's needs or if placement in another available placement setting best meets the child's needs in the least restrictive environment; and

    iii. Approve or disapprove the child's placement in the qualified residential treatment program.

h. Uncertainty by a parent, guardian, legal custodian, relative, or other suitable person that the alleged abuser has in fact abused the child shall not, alone, be the basis upon which a child is removed from the care of a parent, guardian, or legal custodian under (a) of this subsection, nor shall it be a basis, alone, to preclude placement with a relative or other suitable person under (c) of this subsection.

i. **If the court places with a relative or other suitable person, and that person has indicated a desire to become a licensed foster parent, the court shall order the department to commence an investigation of the home of such relative or other suitable person within 24 hours and thereafter expedite licensure of such relative or other suitable person, if qualified, as a foster parent. If licensed, the foster care subsidy shall be paid to the relative or other suitable person retroactive to the date of placement. If such home is found to be unqualified for licensure, the department shall report such fact to the court within one week of that determination. Such determination must be made prior to the entry of any dispositional orders in the case.**

j. **If the court places the child in licensed foster care:**

    i. **The petitioner shall report to the court, at the shelter care hearing, the location of the licensed foster placement the petitioner has identified for the child and the court shall inquire as to whether:**
</code></pre>
<p>(A) <strong>The identified placement is the least restrictive placement necessary to meet the needs of the child;</strong></p>
<p>(B) <strong>The child will be able to remain in the same school and whether any orders of the court are necessary to ensure educational stability for the child;</strong></p>
<p>(C) <strong>The child will be placed with a sibling or siblings, and whether court-ordered sibling contact would promote the well-being of the child;</strong></p>
<p>(D) <strong>The licensed foster placement is able to meet the special needs of the child;</strong></p>
<p>(E) <strong>The location of the proposed foster placement will impede visitation with the child's parent or parents;</strong></p>
<pre><code>    ii. **The court may order the department to:**
</code></pre>
<p>(A) <strong>Place the child in a less restrictive placement;</strong></p>
<p>(B) <strong>Place the child in a location in closer proximity to the child's parent, home, or school;</strong></p>
<p>(C) <strong>Place the child with the child's sibling or siblings;</strong></p>
<p>(D) <strong>Take any other necessary steps to ensure the child's health, safety, and well-being;</strong></p>
<pre><code>    iii. **The court shall advise the petitioner that:**
</code></pre>
<p>(A) <strong>Failure to comply with court orders shall result in a finding that reasonable efforts have not been made by the department to finalize the permanent plan during a hearing under RCW 13.34.110; and</strong></p>
<p>(B) <strong>Placement moves while a child is in shelter care will be considered when determining whether reasonable efforts have been made by the department to finalize the permanent plan during a fact-finding hearing under RCW 13.34.110.</strong></p>
