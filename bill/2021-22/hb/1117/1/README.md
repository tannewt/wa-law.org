# House Bill 1117

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/House%20Bills/1117.xml)
## Section 1
(1) The legislature finds that:
(a) Salmon and other anadromous fish have a special historical, economic, and cultural importance to Washington;
(b) As a consequence of their centrality to treaty-protected rights reserved to Indian tribes, and the efforts required to be undertaken in order to preserve those rights and recover threatened and endangered species, the preservation and recovery of salmonid populations is a uniquely important legislative priority;
(c) Nontribal commercial and recreational fishing and salmon viewing contribute significantly to the economic and social stability and well-being of Washington residents;
(d) By including salmon in front-end planning undertaken under the growth management act, local governments will avoid or reduce risks that litigation against them will arise related to violations of treaty rights and comanager relationships; and
(e) Ensuring that future development, redevelopment, and population growth are compatible with the long-term survival and recovery of anadromous fish species is essential to Washington's continued vibrancy and quality of life.
(2) Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to support the protection of salmon through:
(a) The adoption and state support of net ecological gain at the WRIA scale and incorporation of key components of the local salmon recovery plan through local government growth and shoreline planning efforts;
(b) Ensuring that proportional compensatory mitigation for impacts that are predicted to occur with a high degree of likelihood over the expected life of the project to wetlands, water, and fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas and other elements of the environment that affect salmon habitat achieves its desired outcomes; and
(c) Providing local governments the full resources needed in the form of funding and technical support to achieve the goals and requirements of this act.

    e. That reduce the inappropriate conversion of undeveloped land into sprawling, low-density development;

    f. That generally do not require the extension of urban governmental services; and

    g. That are consistent with the protection **and restoration** of natural surface water flows and groundwater and surface water recharge and discharge areas.

23. "Rural development" refers to development outside the urban growth area and outside agricultural, forest, and mineral resource lands designated pursuant to RCW 36.70A.170. Rural development can consist of a variety of uses and residential densities, including clustered residential development, at levels that are consistent with the preservation of rural character and the requirements of the rural element. Rural development does not refer to agriculture or forestry activities that may be conducted in rural areas.

24. "Rural governmental services" or "rural services" include those public services and public facilities historically and typically delivered at an intensity usually found in rural areas, and may include domestic water systems, fire and police protection services, transportation and public transit services, and other public utilities associated with rural development and normally not associated with urban areas. Rural services do not include storm or sanitary sewers, except as otherwise authorized by RCW 36.70A.110(4).

25. "Short line railroad" means those railroad lines designated class II or class III by the United States surface transportation board.

"Urban growth" refers to growth that makes intensive use of land for the location of buildings, structures, and impermeable surfaces to such a degree as to be incompatible with the primary use of land for the production of food, other agricultural products, or fiber, or the extraction of mineral resources, rural uses, rural development, and natural resource lands designated pursuant to RCW 36.70A.170. A pattern of more intensive rural development, as provided in RCW 36.70A.070(5)(d), is not urban growth. When allowed to spread over wide areas, urban growth typically requires urban governmental services. "Characterized by urban growth" refers to land having urban growth located on it, or to land located in relationship to an area with urban growth on it as to be appropriate for urban growth.

28. "Urban growth areas" means those areas designated by a county pursuant to RCW 36.70A.110.

29. "Very low-income household" means a single person, family, or unrelated persons living together whose adjusted income is at or below fifty percent of the median household income adjusted for household size, for the county where the household is located, as reported by the United States department of housing and urban development.

    a. Each county that is required or chooses to plan under RCW 36.70A.040, and each city within such county, shall adopt development regulations on or before September 1, 1991, to assure the conservation of agricultural, forest, and mineral resource lands designated under RCW 36.70A.170. Regulations adopted under this subsection may not prohibit uses legally existing on any parcel prior to their adoption and shall remain in effect until the county or city adopts development regulations pursuant to RCW 36.70A.040. Such regulations shall assure that the use of lands adjacent to agricultural, forest, or mineral resource lands shall not interfere with the continued use, in the accustomed manner and in accordance with best management practices, of these designated lands for the production of food, agricultural products, or timber, or for the extraction of minerals. Any county located to the west of the crest of the Cascade mountains that has both a population of at least four hundred thousand and a border that touches another state, and any city in such county, may adopt development regulations to assure that agriculture, forest, and mineral resource lands adjacent to short line railroads may be developed for freight rail dependent uses.

    b. Counties and cities shall require that all plats, short plats, development permits, and building permits issued for development activities on, or within five hundred feet of, lands designated as agricultural lands, forestlands, or mineral resource lands, contain a notice that the subject property is within or near designated agricultural lands, forestlands, or mineral resource lands on which a variety of commercial activities may occur that are not compatible with residential development for certain periods of limited duration. The notice for mineral resource lands shall also inform that an application might be made for mining-related activities, including mining, extraction, washing, crushing, stockpiling, blasting, transporting, and recycling of minerals.

    c. Each county that adopts a resolution of partial planning under RCW 36.70A.040(2)(b), and each city within such county, shall adopt development regulations within one year after the adoption of the resolution of partial planning to assure the conservation of agricultural, forest, and mineral resource lands designated under RCW 36.70A.170. Regulations adopted under this subsection (1)(c) must comply with the requirements governing regulations adopted under (a) of this subsection.

    d. [Empty]

        i. A county that adopts a resolution of partial planning under RCW 36.70A.040(2)(b) and that is not in compliance with the planning requirements of this section, RCW 36.70A.040(4), 36.70A.070(5), 36.70A.170, and 36.70A.172 at the time the resolution is adopted must, by January 30, 2017, apply for a determination of compliance from the department finding that the county's development regulations, including development regulations adopted to protect critical areas, and comprehensive plans are in compliance with the requirements of this section, RCW 36.70A.040(4), 36.70A.070(5), 36.70A.170, and 36.70A.172. The department must approve or deny the application for a determination of compliance within one hundred twenty days of its receipt or by June 30, 2017, whichever date is earlier.

        ii. If the department denies an application under (d)(i) of this subsection, the county and each city within is obligated to comply with all requirements of this chapter and the resolution for partial planning adopted under RCW 36.70A.040(2)(b) is no longer in effect.

        iii. A petition for review of a determination of compliance under (d)(i) of this subsection may only be appealed to the growth management hearings board within sixty days of the issuance of the decision by the department.

        iv. In the event of a filing of a petition in accordance with (d)(iii) of this subsection, the county and the department must equally share the costs incurred by the department for defending an approval of determination of compliance that is before the growth management hearings board.

    v. The department may implement this subsection (1)(d) by adopting rules related to determinations of compliance. The rules may address, but are not limited to: The requirements for applications for a determination of compliance; charging of costs under (d)(iv) of this subsection; procedures for processing applications; criteria for the evaluation of applications; issuance and notice of department decisions; and applicable timelines.

    e. Any county that borders both the Cascade mountains and another country and has a population of less than fifty thousand people, and any city in such county, may adopt development regulations to assure that agriculture, forest, and mineral resource lands adjacent to short line railroads may be developed for freight rail dependent uses.

2. Each county and city shall adopt development regulations that protect critical areas that are required to be designated under RCW 36.70A.170. For counties and cities that are required or choose to plan under RCW 36.70A.040, such development regulations shall be adopted on or before September 1, 1991. For the remainder of the counties and cities, such development regulations shall be adopted on or before March 1, 1992. **Regulations that protect critical areas must apply the mitigation hierarchy requirement by requiring that projects avoid impacts where avoidance is reasonably attainable, minimize impacts where avoidance is not reasonably attainable, and use compensatory mitigation where avoidance and minimization are not reasonably attainable. When using compensatory mitigation, regulations must ensure that measures to mitigate by compensating for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute resources or environments result in no net loss of ecological function under a range of compensatory mitigation implementation scenarios, including compensatory mitigation implementation scenarios in which:**

    a. **The ecological functions and services provided by impacted elements of the environment are superior to the ecological functions and services provided by the mitigation measures; and**

    b. **Mitigation measures do not function as successfully as designed, intended, or expected.**

3. Such counties and cities shall review these designations and development regulations when adopting their comprehensive plans under RCW 36.70A.040 and implementing development regulations under RCW 36.70A.120 and may alter such designations and development regulations to insure consistency.

4. Forestland and agricultural land located within urban growth areas shall not be designated by a county or city as forestland or agricultural land of long-term commercial significance under RCW 36.70A.170 unless the city or county has enacted a program authorizing transfer or purchase of development rights.


## Section 7
> This section modifies existing section [90.74.020](/rcw/90_water_rights—environment/90.74_aquatic_resources_mitigation.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/90_water_rights—environment/90.74_aquatic_resources_mitigation.md) for context.

1. Project proponents may use a mitigation plan to propose compensatory mitigation within a watershed. A mitigation plan shall:

    a. Contain provisions that guarantee the long-term viability of the created, restored, enhanced, or preserved habitat, including assurances for protecting any essential biological functions and values defined in the mitigation plan;

    b. Contain provisions for long-term monitoring of any created, restored, or enhanced mitigation site;

    c. Be consistent with the local comprehensive land use plan and any other applicable planning process in effect for the development area, such as an adopted subbasin or watershed plan**; and**

    d. **Apply the mitigation hierarchy requirement by requiring that projects avoid impacts where avoidance is reasonably attainable, minimize impacts where avoidance is not reasonably attainable, and use compensatory mitigation where avoidance and minimization are not reasonably attainable. When using compensatory mitigation, a mitigation plan must ensure that measures to mitigate by compensating for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute resources or environments result in no net loss of ecological function under a range of compensatory mitigation implementation scenarios, including compensatory mitigation implementation scenarios in which:**

        i. **The ecological functions and services provided by impacted elements of the environment are superior to the ecological functions and services provided by the mitigation measures; and**

        ii. **Mitigation measures do not function as successfully as designed, intended, or expected**.

2. [Empty]

    a. The departments of ecology and fish and wildlife may not limit the scope of options in a mitigation plan to areas on or near the project site, or to habitat types of the same type as contained on the project site. The departments of ecology and fish and wildlife shall fully review and give due consideration to compensatory mitigation proposals that improve the overall biological functions and values of the watershed or bay and accommodate the mitigation needs of the infrastructure development or noninfrastructure development, including proposals or portions of proposals that are explored or developed in RCW 90.74.040.

    b. The departments of ecology and fish and wildlife are not required to grant approval to a mitigation plan that the departments find does not provide equal or better biological functions and values within the watershed or bay.

3. When making a permit or other regulatory decision under the guidance of this chapter, the departments of ecology and fish and wildlife shall consider whether the mitigation plan provides equal or better biological functions and values, compared to the existing conditions, for the target resources or species identified in the mitigation plan. This consideration shall be based upon the following factors:

    a. The relative value of the mitigation for the target resources, in terms of the quality and quantity of biological functions and values provided;

    b. The compatibility of the proposal with the intent of broader resource management and habitat management objectives and plans, such as existing resource management plans, watershed plans, critical areas ordinances, the forestry riparian easement program, the riparian open space program, the family forest fish passage program, and shoreline master programs;

    c. The ability of the mitigation to address scarce functions or values within a watershed;

    d. The benefits of the proposal to broader watershed landscape, including the benefits of connecting various habitat units or providing population-limiting habitats or functions for target species;

    e. The benefits of early implementation of habitat mitigation for projects that provide compensatory mitigation in advance of the project's planned impacts; and

    f. The significance of any negative impacts to nontarget species or resources.

4. A mitigation plan may be approved through a memorandum of agreement between the project proponent and either the department of ecology or the department of fish and wildlife, or both.
