<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Salmon and other anadromous fish have a special historical, economic, and cultural importance to Washington;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a consequence of their centrality to treaty-protected rights reserved to Indian tribes, and the efforts required to be undertaken in order to preserve those rights and recover threatened and endangered species, the preservation and recovery of salmonid populations is a uniquely important legislative priority;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nontribal commercial and recreational fishing and salmon viewing contribute significantly to the economic and social stability and well-being of Washington residents; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring that future development, redevelopment, and population growth are compatible with the long-term survival and recovery of anadromous fish species is essential to Washington's continued vibrancy and quality of life.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to support the protection of salmon through:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The adoption and state support of net ecological gain at the WRIA scale and incorporation of applicable elements of the local salmon recovery plan through local government growth and shoreline planning efforts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring that proportional compensatory mitigation for direct and indirect impacts that are predicted to occur over the expected life of the project to wetlands, water, and fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas and other elements of the environment that affect salmon habitat achieves its desired outcomes; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing local governments the full resources needed in the form of funding and technical support to achieve the goals and requirements of this act.</p>

<li>
<p>The department of fish and wildlife, with recommendations from the Washington state academy of sciences, shall adopt rules that establish criteria for net ecological gain and consistency with the applicable regional salmon recovery plans that counties and cities planning under RCW 36.70A.040 must meet through adoption of their comprehensive plans in order to support salmon recovery. In adopting rules pursuant to this section, the department of fish and wildlife must consult on an early and continuous basis with each federally recognized Indian tribe with property, tribal reservation land, or usual and accustomed fishing areas in, adjacent to, or directly affected by the planning jurisdiction. The department must also communicate with governments planning under RCW 36.70A.040 during the process of adopting rules pursuant to this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rules adopted under this section must address the applicable components of salmon recovery plans that local governments have authority over, such as the habitat restoration and protection elements of the recovery plans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rules adopted under this section must ensure that, where appropriate, the interjurisdictional coordination process required by RCW 36.70A.100 addresses the issue of salmon recovery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rules adopted under this section must not require or assume that the proponents of individual private projects will be responsible for achieving net ecological gain. Rules adopted under this section must ensure that individual private projects achieve no net loss of ecological function. Rules adopted under this section must ensure that net ecological gain is advanced through the appropriate selection of publicly funded projects, and voluntary projects whose purpose is salmon recovery but which may receive funding from either public or private sources. Rules adopted under this section related to net ecological gain must account for the impact of the urban heat island effect on ecological function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of fish and wildlife shall monitor progress towards the goals set forth in the regional salmon recovery plans, including parameters that affect salmonid health, including, but not limited to, stream temperature, impervious surfaces, and tree canopy cover. As part of its monitoring, and as appropriate, the department of fish and wildlife shall obtain monitoring data from relevant and reliable sources, including, but not limited to, local governments, state agencies, federal agencies, and Indian tribes. In addition, the department of fish and wildlife shall also monitor and report the progress that each jurisdiction planning under RCW 36.70A.040 has made toward achieving no net loss of ecological function and net ecological gain. As part of this ongoing monitoring effort, the department of fish and wildlife, in early and continuous consultation with each federally recognized Indian tribe with property, tribal reservation land, or usual and accustomed fishing areas in, adjacent to, or directly affected by the planning jurisdiction, and in communication with the affected local governments, shall first establish the current environmental baseline conditions within each county and city planning under RCW 36.70A.040, identify any monitoring data gaps and make recommendations to fill those gaps, and monitor the degree to which each jurisdiction is successful at achieving net ecological gains, and no net losses through individual projects, over time, including, where appropriate, the efforts made by jurisdictions to address the effect of urban heat islands on salmonid health. The department of fish and wildlife is encouraged to work with or seek feedback from the local watershed groups in review of the current environmental baseline conditions and monitoring efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of fish and wildlife shall facilitate an ongoing and collaborative process for the purpose of identifying gaps and targets related to salmon habitat and funding, to be informed by its monitoring work pursuant to this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of fish and wildlife shall provide a report of its monitoring under this section to the governor, the appropriate committees of the legislature, and the local governments subject to this act, no later than October 15th of every even-numbered year, beginning in 2022.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The relative value of the mitigation for the target resources, in terms of the quality and quantity of biological functions and values provided;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The compatibility of the proposal with the intent of broader resource management and habitat management objectives and plans, such as existing resource management plans, watershed plans, critical areas ordinances, the forestry riparian easement program, the riparian open space program, the family forest fish passage program, and shoreline master programs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability of the mitigation to address scarce functions or values within a watershed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The benefits of the proposal to broader watershed landscape, including the benefits of connecting various habitat units or providing population-limiting habitats or functions for target species;</p>

<li>
<p>The benefits of early implementation of habitat mitigation for projects that provide compensatory mitigation in advance of the project's planned impacts; and</p>
