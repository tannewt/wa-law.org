<p>The legislature finds that youth benefit by engaging in outdoor activities, such as fishing and shellfishing. Participating in such activities can boost self-esteem and cultivate an appreciation for nature. The legislature further finds that expensive equipment and license fees can be a barrier to this activity for some youth. Therefore, the legislature intends to reduce financial barriers to fishing and shellfishing by establishing a grant program to enable local organizations to establish equipment rental programs and increase the age at which a fishing license is required.</p>
