</li>
<li>
<p>Shall adopt rules implementing the smoke opacity testing requirement for diesel vehicles that ensure that such test is objective and repeatable and that properly maintained engines that otherwise would meet the applicable federal emission standards, as measured by the new engine certification test, would not fail the smoke opacity test.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shall designate a geographic area as being a &quot;noncompliance area&quot; for motor vehicle emissions if (a) the department's analysis of emission and ambient air quality data, covering a period of no less than one year, indicates that the standard has or will probably be exceeded, and (b) the department determines that the primary source of the air contaminant is motor vehicle emissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shall reevaluate noncompliance areas if the United States environmental protection agency modifies the relevant air quality standards, and shall discontinue the program if compliance is indicated and if the department determines that the area would continue to be in compliance after the program is discontinued. The director shall notify persons residing in noncompliance areas of the reevaluation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shall analyze information regarding the motor vehicle traffic in a noncompliance area to determine the smallest land area within whose boundaries are present registered motor vehicles that contribute significantly to the violation of motor vehicle-related air quality standards in the noncompliance area. The director shall declare the area to be an &quot;emission contributing area.&quot; An emission contributing area established for a carbon monoxide or oxides of nitrogen noncompliance area must contain the noncompliance area within its boundaries. An emission contributing area established for an ozone noncompliance area located in this state need not contain the ozone noncompliance area within its boundaries if it can be proven that vehicles registered in the area contribute significantly to violations of the ozone air quality standard in the noncompliance area. An emission contributing area may be established in this state for violations of federal air quality standards for ozone in an adjacent state if (a) the United States environmental protection agency designates an area to be a &quot;nonattainment area for ozone&quot; under the provisions of the federal Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), and (b) it can be proven that vehicles registered in this state contribute significantly to the violation of the federal air quality standards for ozone in the adjacent state's nonattainment area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shall, after consultation with the appropriate local government entities, designate areas as being noncompliance areas or emission contributing areas, and shall establish the boundaries of such areas by rule. The director may also modify boundaries. In establishing the external boundaries of an emission contributing area, the director shall use the boundaries established for ZIP code service areas by the United States postal service.</p>

<p>The department shall establish a scientific advisory board to review plans to establish or expand the geographic area where an inspection and maintenance system for motor vehicle emissions is required. The board shall consist of three to five members. All members shall have at least a master's degree in physics, chemistry, or engineering, or a closely related field. No member may be a current employee of a local air pollution control authority, the department, the United States environmental protection agency, or a company that may benefit from a review by the board.</p>
<p>The board shall review an inspection and maintenance plan at the request of a local air pollution control authority, the department, or by a petition of at least fifty people living within the proposed boundaries of a vehicle emission inspection and maintenance system. The entity or entities requesting a scientific review may include specific issues for the board to consider in its review. The board shall limit its review to matters of science and shall not provide advice on penalties or issues that are strictly legal in nature.</p>
<p>The board shall provide a complete written review to the department. If the board members are not in agreement as to the scientific merit of any issue under review, the board may include a dissenting opinion in its report to the department. The department shall immediately make copies available to the local air pollution control authority and to the public.</p>
<p>The department shall conduct a public hearing, within the area affected by the proposed rule, if any significant aspect of the rule is in conflict with a majority opinion of the board. The department shall include in its responsiveness summary the rationale for including a rule that is not consistent with the review of the board, including a response to the issues raised at the public hearing.</p>

<p>By July 1, 2022, the department shall establish a baseline for emissions of greenhouse gases for vehicles used on online-enabled applications or platforms of commercial transportation services providers on a per-passenger-mile traveled basis. The baseline calculation must use data from calendar year 2018 and include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Miles driven with no passenger delivery in the vehicle when the operator of the vehicle is logged in to a provider's digital platform or software application; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Miles driven with one or more passengers in the vehicle as a prearranged ride.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commercial transportation services providers must provide information to the department covering individual calendar years, consistent with a reporting schedule and criteria to be adopted by rule by the department. The department may require commercial transportation services providers to provide data regarding the number of vehicles operating in Washington by city and by county. The department must use the provided information to determine average emissions of greenhouse gases per passenger-mile including, but not limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The total miles driven by vehicles operated to provide commercial transportation services in Washington state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The percent share of miles traveled by zero emission vehicles;</p>

<li>
<p>The miles-weighted average network-wide grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per mile, for purposes of producing an estimate of greenhouse gas emissions; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Total passenger-miles traveled using an average passengers-per-trip estimate to account for trips where exact passenger head count data was not captured.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may use reasonable methods to adjust and correct data and emission estimates including, but not limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Methods to apportion emissions between commercial transportation services providers to account for: (i) Circumstances in which multiple applications or platforms are simultaneously used by a vehicle provider; or (ii) periods when vehicle providers are driving primarily for purposes other than engaging with services provided by the commercial transportation service provider, even though the latter party may be recording data on the vehicle provider's movement; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Methods to account for passenger-miles provided via zero emissions transportation or public transit, other than a motor vehicle, offered in connection with a commercial transportation services provider's digital network.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may establish a baseline for a commercial transportation services provider that begins operating in Washington after calendar year 2018 with consideration of the baselines established under subsection (1) of this section and the information received by the department under subsection (2) of this section.</p>
