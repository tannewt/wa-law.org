<p>The legislature finds the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Washington is home to more than 1,000,000 immigrants who attend school, work, pay taxes, and contribute to our state's vibrant economy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individuals with health insurance coverage have better health outcomes than those who lack coverage. Uninsured individuals are more likely to be in poor health and more likely to delay or forego needed health care services, which ultimately drives up the cost of care. Federal law unjustly excludes certain categories of immigrants from receiving affordable health coverage. As a result, immigrants are disproportionately uninsured and at risk for poor health outcomes. An estimated 46 percent of undocumented Washingtonians are uninsured, compared to just seven percent in the general population;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington state has a long history of working toward equity in immigrant health coverage. The state's basic health program successfully covered low-income residents without regard to immigration status until it was dismantled in anticipation of affordable care act reforms which have proven to be insufficient. By contrast, the state's cover all kids law was retained and continues to be successful in reducing immigration-related inequity among Washington's children;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing inequities for immigrants, many of whom are performing jobs deemed essential, despite the risks to themselves and their families. COVID-19 infection rates in Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander and Latinx patients are five times higher than the rate in White counterparts, and twice as high in Black patients. Death rates for Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander patients are six times higher than the rate for White patients and four times as high in Latinx patients;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are opportunities for the state to seek federal flexibility to cover immigrants otherwise excluded from federal health programs; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a matter of equity, the legislature therefore intends to improve the health of all people in this state by extending health coverage at parity to all Washington residents, regardless of immigration status by creating state lookalike programs for: Medicaid, accessible for free to people who otherwise meet eligibility for federal medicaid but for immigration status; and, qualified health plans and qualified dental plans, subsidized in cost to the same extent qualified health and dental plans on the exchange are subsidized.</p>
</li>
</ol>
