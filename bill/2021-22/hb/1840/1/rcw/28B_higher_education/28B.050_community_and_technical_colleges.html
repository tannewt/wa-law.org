<p>The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the dramatically increasing number of students requiring high standards of education either as a part of the continuing higher education program or for occupational education and training, or for adult basic skills and literacy education, by creating a new, independent system of community and technical colleges which will:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Offer an open door to every citizen, regardless of his or her academic background or experience, at a cost normally within his or her economic means;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that each college district, in coordination with adjacent college districts, shall offer thoroughly comprehensive educational, training, and service programs to meet the needs of both the communities and students served by combining high standards of excellence in academic transfer courses; realistic and practical courses in occupational education, both graded and ungraded; community services of an educational, cultural, and recreational nature; and adult education, including basic skills and general, family, and workforce literacy programs and services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide for basic skills and literacy education, and occupational education and technical training in order to prepare students for careers in a competitive workforce;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide or coordinate related and supplemental instruction for apprentices at community and technical colleges;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide administration by state and local boards which will avoid unnecessary duplication of facilities, programs, student services, or administrative functions; and which will encourage efficiency in operation and creativity and imagination in education, training, and service to meet the needs of the community and students;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow for the growth, improvement, flexibility and modification of the community colleges and their education, training, and service programs as future needs occur; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish firmly that as provided under RCW 28B.50.810, community colleges are, for purposes of academic training, two year institutions, and are an independent, unique, and vital section of our state's higher education system, separate from both the common school system and other institutions of higher learning.</p>

Factors to be considered include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The economic feasibility and cost savings anticipated from the proposed changes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The extent to which the changes will contribute to student access to academic programs and services, including greater flexibility for students to transfer credits and obtain degrees and certificates from other colleges within the regional area; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The extent to which the changes contribute to the vision, goals, priorities, and statewide strategies in the comprehensive master plan and the statewide strategic master plan for higher education.</p>

<li>
<p>The state board for community and technical colleges shall develop and adopt a detailed plan for the implementation of any identified changes that would result in cost savings while maintaining or enhancing student access and achievement. If educational programs are identified that would provide cost savings if consolidated, the faculty and staff of those programs shall be convened to assist in the development of the part of the plan that will impact their programs and collective bargaining agreements. The plan must establish a time frame within which any proposed changes must be accomplished and must include any agreements, approved by the state board for community and technical colleges, between colleges within a regional area to provide complementary academic programs or coordinate administrative functions. The implementation plan shall take effect upon approval by the state board for community and technical colleges. The state board shall submit a preliminary report on the plan to the appropriate legislative committees and the governor December 1, 2010, and shall submit a final report December 1, 2011.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any cost savings realized as a result of the implementation of administrative efficiencies, complementary administrative functions, and complementary academic programming under the plan shall be retained by the respective districts to be used for enhancing student access and success, and the retention and recruitment of high quality faculty, including but not limited to, full-time faculty, faculty development, and academic programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The college board, using the criteria and processes established in this section and in consultation with the boards of trustees for the community and technical colleges, shall identify adjacent college districts that can feasibly be consolidated or whose boundaries can feasibly be modified to form a multiple campus district. The primary considerations shall be the extent to which the changes will: (a) Affect student access to academic programs and services, (b) affect the retention and recruitment of high quality faculty, and (c) result in financial efficiencies.</p>
</li>

<p>The legislature finds that a vocational institute in the central area of the city of Seattle provides civic, social, and economic benefits to the people of the state of Washington. Economic development is enhanced by increasing the number of skilled individuals who enter the labor market and social welfare costs are reduced by the training of individuals lacking marketable skills. The students at the institute are historically economically disadvantaged, and include racial and ethnic minorities, recent immigrants, single-parent heads of households, and persons who are dislocated workers or without specific occupational skills. The institute presents a unique opportunity for business, labor, and community-based organizations, and educators to work together to provide effective vocational-technical training to the economically disadvantaged of urban Seattle, and to serve as a national model of such cooperation. Moreover, a trained workforce is a major factor in attracting new employers, and with greater minority participation in the workforce, the institute is uniquely located to deliver training and education to the individuals employers must increasingly turn to for their future workers.</p>

<p>Although Everett Community College offers an associate degree nursing program that graduates approximately seventy to ninety students per year, the University Center does not offer a bachelor of science in nursing. Some graduates of the Everett Community College program are able to articulate to the bachelor of science in nursing program offered by the University of Washington-Bothell at its Bothell campus or in Mt. Vernon but current capacity is not sufficient for all of the graduates who are both interested and qualified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite recent growth in nursing education capacity, shortages still persist for registered nurses. According to a June 2007 study by the Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho center for health workforce studies, the average age of Washington's registered nurses was forty-eight years. More than a third were fifty-five years of age or older. Consequently, the high rate of registered nurses retiring from nursing practice over the next two decades will significantly reduce the supply. This reduction comes at the same time as the state's population grows and ages. The registered nurse education capacity in Washington has a large impact on the supply of registered nurses in the state. If the rate of graduation in registered nursing does not increase, projections show that supply in Washington will begin to decline by 2015. In contrast, if graduation rates increased by four hundred per year, the supply of registered nurses would meet estimated demand by the year 2021.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to specific funding to support up to fifty full-time equivalent students in a bachelor of nursing program, the University Center of North Puget Sound, in partnership with the University of Washington-Bothell, shall offer a bachelor of science in nursing program with capacity for up to fifty full-time students.</p>

<p>The legislature recognizes that student outcomes and success, especially for first generation, underserved students, may be significantly improved by increasing the number of full-time faculty at community and technical colleges.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The legislature's goal is that community and technical colleges increase the numbers of full-time tenured positions by adding 200 new full-time tenure-track positions in the 2021-2023 fiscal biennium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This goal is best accomplished through converting part-time faculty positions to full-time tenure-track positions and by hiring new full-time faculty through processes identified in each college's diversity, equity, and inclusion of all races strategic plan described in RCW 28B.50.920. If specific funding for the purpose of conversion assignments proposed in this section is not provided in the omnibus appropriations act, the conversion assignments proposed must be delayed until such time as specific funding is provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The college board must collect data and assess the impact of the 200 additional full-time tenure-track faculty on student completion rates. The college board must convene representatives of faculty, staff, and administration to report on outcomes as a result of increasing full-time tenure-track faculty. In consultation with representatives of faculty, staff, and administration, the college board must make recommendations about future steps to increase full-time tenure-track faculty that incorporate faculty diversity and historically underserved communities. The college board must report the results of its assessment, along with next step recommendations, to the legislature by December 15, 2023. The college board shall conspicuously post on its website and include in the report definitions for key terms including: Diversity, equity, inclusion, culturally competent, culturally appropriate, historically marginalized communities, communities of color, low-income communities, and community organizations.</p>

<p>The college board may declare a financial emergency under the following conditions: (1) Reduction of allotments by the governor pursuant to *RCW 43.88.110(2), or (2) reduction by the legislature from one biennium to the next or within a biennium of appropriated funds based on constant dollars using the implicit price deflator. When a district board of trustees determines that a reduction in force of tenured or probationary faculty members may be necessary due to financial emergency as declared by the state board, written notice of the reduction in force and separation from employment shall be given the faculty members so affected by the president or district president as the case may be. Said notice shall clearly indicate that separation is not due to the job performance of the employee and hence is without prejudice to such employee and need only state in addition the basis for the reduction in force as one or more of the reasons enumerated in subsections (1) and (2) of this section.</p>
<p>Said tenured or probationary faculty members will have a right to request a formal hearing when being dismissed pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of this section. The only issue to be determined shall be whether under the applicable policies, rules or collective bargaining agreement the particular faculty member or members advised of severance are the proper ones to be terminated. Said hearing shall be initiated by filing a written request therefor with the president or district president, as the case may be, within ten days after issuance of such notice. At such formal hearing the tenure review committee provided for in RCW 28B.50.863 may observe the formal hearing procedure and after the conclusion of such hearing offer its recommended decision for consideration by the hearing officer. Failure to timely request such a hearing shall cause separation from service of such faculty members so notified on the effective date as stated in the notice, regardless of the duration of any individual employment contract.</p>
<p>The hearing required by this section shall be an adjudicative proceeding pursuant to chapter 34.05 RCW, the Administrative Procedure Act, conducted by a hearing officer appointed by the board of trustees and shall be concluded by the hearing officer within sixty days after written notice of the reduction in force has been issued. Ten days written notice of the formal hearing will be given to faculty members who have requested such a hearing by the president or district president as the case may be. The hearing officer within ten days after conclusion of such formal hearing shall prepare findings, conclusions of law and a recommended decision which shall be forwarded to the board of trustees for its final action thereon. Any such determination by the hearing officer under this section shall not be subject to further tenure review committee action as otherwise provided in this chapter.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, at the time of a faculty member or members request for formal hearing said faculty member or members may ask for participation in the choosing of the hearing officer in the manner provided in RCW 28A.405.310(4), said employee therein being a faculty member for the purposes hereof and said board of directors therein being the board of trustees for the purposes hereof: PROVIDED, That where there is more than one faculty member affected by the board of trustees' reduction in force such faculty members requesting hearing must act collectively in making such request: PROVIDED FURTHER, That costs incurred for the services and expenses of such hearing officer shall be shared equally by the community or technical college and the faculty member or faculty members requesting hearing.</p>
<p>When more than one faculty member is notified of termination because of a reduction in force as provided in this section, hearings for all such faculty members requesting formal hearing shall be consolidated and only one such hearing for the affected faculty members shall be held, and such consolidated hearing shall be concluded within the time frame set forth herein.</p>
<p>Separation from service without prejudice after formal hearing under the provisions of this section shall become effective upon final action by the board of trustees.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature by enactment of this section and in accordance with RCW 28B.52.035, to modify any collective bargaining agreements in effect, or any conflicting board policies or rules, so that any reductions in force which take place after December 21, 1981, whether in progress or to be initiated, will comply solely with the provisions of this section: PROVIDED, That any applicable policies, rules, or provisions contained in a collective bargaining agreement related to lay-off units, seniority and reemployment rights shall not be affected by the provisions of this paragraph.</p>
