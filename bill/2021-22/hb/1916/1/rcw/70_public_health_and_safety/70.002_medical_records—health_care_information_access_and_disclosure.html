<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Health care information is personal and sensitive information that if improperly used or released may do significant harm to a patient's interests in privacy, health care, or other interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Patients need access to their own health care information as a matter of fairness to enable them to make informed decisions about their health care and correct inaccurate or incomplete information about themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to retain the full trust and confidence of patients, health care providers have an interest in assuring that health care information is not improperly disclosed and in having clear and certain rules for the disclosure of health care information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persons other than health care providers obtain, use, and disclose health record information in many different contexts and for many different purposes. It is the public policy of this state that a patient's interest in the proper use and disclosure of the patient's health care information survives even when the information is held by persons other than health care providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The movement of patients and their health care information across state lines, access to and exchange of health care information from automated data banks, and the emergence of multistate health care providers creates a compelling need for uniform law, rules, and procedures governing the use and disclosure of health care information.</p>

<p>When an adolescent voluntarily consents to his or her own mental health treatment under RCW 71.34.500 or 71.34.530, a mental health professional shall not proactively exercise his or her discretion under RCW 70.02.240 to release information or records related to solely mental health services received by the adolescent to a parent of the adolescent, beyond any notification required under RCW 71.34.510, unless the adolescent states a clear desire to do so which is documented by the mental health professional, except in situations concerning an imminent threat to the health and safety of the adolescent or others, or as otherwise may be required by law.</p>

<li>
<p>In the event a mental health professional discloses information or releases records, or both, that relate solely to mental health services of an adolescent, to a parent pursuant to RCW 70.02.240(3), the mental health professional must provide notice of this disclosure to the adolescent and the adolescent must have a reasonable opportunity to express any concerns about this disclosure to the mental health professional prior to the disclosure of the information or records related solely to mental health services. The mental health professional shall document any objections to disclosure in the adolescent's medical record if the mental health professional subsequently discloses information or records related solely to mental health services over the objection of the adolescent.</p>

<p>When an adolescent receives a mental health evaluation or treatment at the direction of a parent under RCW 71.34.600 through 71.34.670, the mental health professional is encouraged to exercise his or her discretion under RCW 70.02.240 to proactively release to the parent such information and records related to solely mental health services received by the adolescent, excluding psychotherapy notes, that are necessary to assist the parent in understanding the nature of the evaluation or treatment and in supporting their child.

<li>
<p>Information or records about an adolescent's substance use disorder evaluation or treatment may be provided to a parent without the written consent of the adolescent only if permitted by federal law. A mental health professional or chemical dependency professional providing substance use disorder evaluation or treatment to an adolescent may seek the written consent of the adolescent to provide substance use disorder treatment information or records to a parent when the mental health professional or chemical dependency professional determines that both seeking the written consent and sharing the substance use disorder treatment information or records of the adolescent would not be detrimental to the adolescent.</p>
