## Section 1
The legislature recognizes the timeless truth articulated by James Otis' great American axiom that taxation without representation is tyranny.

The legislature acknowledges that limiting some legislators' access to capitol buildings, facilities, and resources creates a constitutional inequality that impairs representation for millions of Washingtonians. And the people of Washington have expressed frustration with this impairment and, more generally, a lack of transparency surrounding many actions of their state government.

The legislature acknowledges that segregating the people's legislative representatives effectively segregates the people. And such segregation violates the spirit and letter of the United States supreme court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which stated clearly that separate is not equal.

Finally, the legislature acknowledges that all branches of Washington's state government must operate within the guarantee clause of the United States Constitution, Article IV, section 4, which promises all people in the United States a republican form of government and provides protection from, among other dangers, "domestic violence."

Applying these important truths, the legislature therefore recognizes the need to clarify and reform the methods and means by which the legislature establishes the rules by which it operates.
