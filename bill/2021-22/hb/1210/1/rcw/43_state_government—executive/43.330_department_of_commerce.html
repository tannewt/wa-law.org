<p>The legislature finds that the long-term economic health of the state and its citizens depends upon the strength and vitality of its communities and businesses. It is the intent of this chapter to create a department of commerce that fosters new partnerships for strong and sustainable communities. The mission of the department is to grow and improve jobs in Washington and facilitate innovation. To carry out its mission, the department will bring together focused efforts to: Streamline access to business assistance and economic development services by providing them through sector-based, cluster-based, and regional partners; provide focused and flexible responses to changing economic conditions; generate greater local capacity to respond to both economic growth and environmental challenges; increase accountability to the public, the executive branch, and the legislature; manage growth and achieve sustainable development; diversify the state's economy and export goods and services; provide greater access to economic opportunity; stimulate private sector investment and entrepreneurship; provide stable family-wage jobs and meet the diverse needs of families; provide affordable housing and housing services; and construct public infrastructure.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that as a result of the rapid pace of global social and economic change, the state and local communities will require coordinated and creative responses by every segment of the community. The state can play a role in assisting such local efforts by reorganizing state assistance efforts to promote such partnerships. The department has a primary responsibility to provide financial and technical assistance to the communities of the state, to assist in improving the delivery of federal, state, and local programs, and to provide communities with opportunities for productive and coordinated development beneficial to the well-being of communities and their residents. It is the intent of the legislature in creating the department to maximize the use of local expertise and resources in the delivery of community and economic development services.</p>

<li>
<p>The department must design and implement an innovation partnership zone program through which the state will encourage and support research institutions, workforce training organizations, and globally competitive companies to work cooperatively in close geographic proximity to create commercially viable products and jobs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director must designate innovation partnership zones on the basis of the following criteria:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Innovation partnership zones must have three types of institutions operating within their boundaries, or show evidence of planning and local partnerships that will lead to dense concentrations of these institutions:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Research capacity in the form of a university or community college fostering commercially valuable research, nonprofit institutions creating commercially applicable innovations, or a national laboratory;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An industry cluster as defined in RCW 43.330.090. The cluster must include a dense proximity of globally competitive firms in a research-based industry or industries or individual firms with innovation strategies linked to (a)(i) of this subsection. A globally competitive firm may be signified through international organization for standardization 9000 or 1400 certification, or evidence of sales in international markets; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training capacity either within the zone or readily accessible to the zone. The training capacity requirement may be met by the same institution as the research capacity requirement, to the extent both are associated with an educational institution in the proposed zone;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The support of a local jurisdiction, a research institution, an educational institution, an industry or cluster association, a workforce development council, and an associate development organization, port, or chamber of commerce;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identifiable boundaries for the zone within which the applicant will concentrate efforts to connect innovative researchers, entrepreneurs, investors, industry associations or clusters, and training providers. The geographic area defined should lend itself to a distinct identity and have the capacity to accommodate firm growth;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The innovation partnership zone administrator must be an economic development council, port, workforce development council, city, or county.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>With respect solely to the research capacity required in subsection (2)(a)(i) of this section, the director may waive the requirement that the research institution be located within the zone. To be considered for such a waiver, an applicant must provide a specific plan that demonstrates the research institution's unique qualifications and suitability for the zone, and the types of jointly executed activities that will be used to ensure ongoing, face-to-face interaction and research collaboration among the zone's partners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On October 1st of each odd-numbered year, the director must designate innovation partnership zones on the basis of applications that meet the legislative criteria, estimated economic impact of the zone, evidence of forward planning for the zone, and other criteria as developed by the department. Estimated economic impact must include evidence of anticipated private investment, job creation, innovation, and commercialization. The director must require evidence that zone applicants will promote commercialization, innovation, and collaboration among zone residents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Innovation partnership zones are eligible for funds and other resources as provided by the legislature or at the discretion of the governor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the innovation partnership zone meets the other requirements of the fund sources, then the zone is eligible for the following funds relating to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The local infrastructure financing tools program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sales and use tax for public facilities in rural counties;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Job skills;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local improvement districts; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community economic revitalization board projects under chapter 43.160 RCW.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An innovation partnership zone must be designated as a zone for a four-year period. At the end of the four-year period, the zone must reapply for the designation through the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the director finds that an applicant does not meet all of the statutory criteria or additional criteria recommended by the department to be designated as an innovation partnership zone, the department must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Identify the deficiencies in the proposal and recommended steps for the applicant to take to strengthen the proposal;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide the applicant with the opportunity to appeal the decision to the director; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow the applicant to reapply for innovation partnership designation on October 1st of the following calendar year or during any subsequent application cycle.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the director finds at any time after the initial year of designation that an innovation partnership zone is failing to meet the performance standards required in its contract with the department, the director may withdraw such designation and cease state funding of the zone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must convene annual information sharing events for innovation partnership zone administrators and other interested parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An innovation partnership zone must annually provide performance measures as required by the director, including but not limited to private investment measures, job creation measures, and measures of innovation such as licensing of ideas in research institutions, patents, or other recognized measures of innovation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must compile a biennial report on the innovation partnership zone program by December 1st of every even-numbered year. The report must provide information for each zone on its: Objectives; funding, tax incentives, and other support obtained from public sector sources; major activities; partnerships; performance measures; and outcomes achieved since the inception of the zone or since the previous biennial report. The department must submit the report to the governor and legislature beginning December 1, 2010.</p>

<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the creation and use of risk reduction mechanisms will promote greater involvement of local financial institutions and other financing mechanisms in funding energy efficiency improvements and will achieve greater leverage of state and federal dollars. Risk reduction mechanisms will allow financial institutions to lend to a broader pool of applicants on more attractive terms, such as potentially lower rates and longer loan terms. Placing a portion of funds in long-term risk reduction mechanisms will support a sustained level of energy efficiency investment by financial institutions while providing funding to projects quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to leverage new federal funding aimed at promoting energy efficiency projects, improving energy efficiency, and increasing family-wage jobs. To this end, the legislature intends to invest a portion of all federal funding, subject to federal requirements, for energy efficiency projects in financial mechanisms that will provide for maximum leverage of financing.</p>

<p>The design, implementation, and administration of the developmental disabilities endowment shall be governed by the following principles:</p>

<li>
<p>The design and operation of the endowment should reward families who set aside resources for their child's future care and provide incentives for continued caregiving by the family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The endowment should encourage financial planning and reward caregiving by a broad range of families, not just those who have substantial financial resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Families should not feel compelled to contribute to the endowment in order to meet the needs of continuing care for their child.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All families should have equal access to developmental disabilities services not funded through the endowment regardless of whether they contribute to the endowment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Services funded through the endowment should be stable, ongoing, of reasonable quality, and respectful of individual and family preferences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Endowment resources should be expended economically in order to benefit as many families as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Endowment resources should be managed prudently so that families can be confident that their agreement with the endowment on behalf of their child will be honored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The private financial contribution on behalf of each person receiving services from the endowment shall be at least equal to the state's contribution to the endowment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to be matched with funding from the state's contribution to the endowment, the private contribution on behalf of a beneficiary must be sufficient to support the beneficiary's approved service plan for a significant portion of the beneficiary's anticipated remaining lifetime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rate that state appropriations to the endowment are used to match private contributions shall be such that each legislative appropriation to the developmental disabilities endowment trust fund, including principal and investment income, is not depleted in a period of less than five years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Private contributions made on behalf of a particular individual, and the associated state match, shall only be used for services provided upon that person's behalf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State funds contributed to the developmental disabilities endowment trust fund are to support the individual trust accounts established by individual private contributions made by families or other interested persons for named individual beneficiaries.</p>

<p>The governing board shall explore methods to solicit private donations. The governing board shall explore mechanisms to support individuals with developmental disabilities who do not have individual private contributions made on their behalf.

<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that every night thousands of homeless youth in Washington go to sleep without the safety, stability, and support of a family or a home. This population is exposed to an increased level of violence, human trafficking, and exploitation resulting in a higher incidence of substance abuse, illness, and death. The prevention and reduction of youth and young adult homelessness and protection of homeless youth is of key concern to the state. Nothing in chapter 69, Laws of 2015 is meant to diminish the work accomplished by the implementation of Becca legislation but rather, the intent of the legislature is to further enhance the state's efforts in working with unaccompanied homeless youth and runaways to encourage family reconciliation or permanent housing and support through dependency when family reconciliation is not a viable alternative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Successfully addressing youth and young adult homelessness ensures that homeless youth and young adults in our state have the support they need to thrive and avoid involvement in the justice system, human trafficking, long-term, avoidable use of public benefits, and extended adult homelessness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing appropriate, relevant, and readily accessible services is critical for addressing one-time, episodic, or longer-term homelessness among youth and young adults, and keeping homeless youth and young adults safe, housed, and connected to family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The coordination of statewide programs to combat youth and young adult homelessness should include programs addressing both youth and young adults. In some instances, best practices mandate that youth programs and young adult programs be segregated in their implementation; however, in other instances, innovative approaches can ensure the health and safety of both populations while serving them together, allowing for alignment with federal programs and funding opportunities, application of adolescent neurodevelopment research, and maximization of capacity to serve more dispersed populations in rural areas. The legislature further finds that the differing needs of these populations should be considered when assessing which programs are relevant and appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To successfully reduce and prevent youth and young adult homelessness, it is the goal of the legislature to have the following key components available and accessible:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Stable housing: It is the goal of the legislature to provide a safe and healthy place for homeless youth to sleep each night until permanency can be reached. Every homeless young adult in our state deserves access to housing that gives them a safe, healthy, and supported launching pad to adulthood. Every family in crisis should have appropriate support as they work to keep their children housed and safe. It is the goal of the legislature that every homeless youth discharged from a public system of care in our state will not be discharged into homelessness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Family reconciliation: All homeless youth should have access to services that support reunification with immediate family. When reunification is not possible for homeless youth, youth should be placed in the custody of the department of children, youth, and families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Permanent connections: Every homeless young adult should have opportunities to establish positive, healthy relationships with adults, including family members, employers, landlords, teachers, and community members, with whom they can maintain connections and from whom they can receive ongoing, long-term support to help them develop the skills and experiences necessary to achieve a successful transition to adulthood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Education and employment: Every homeless young adult in our state deserves the opportunity and support they need to complete their high school education and pursue additional education and training. It is the goal of the legislature that every homeless young adult in our state will have the opportunity to engage in employment training and be able to access employment. With both education and employment support and opportunities, young adults will have the skills they need to become self-sufficient, self-reliant, and independent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social and emotional well-being: Every homeless youth and young adult in our state should have access to both behavioral health care and physical health care. Every state-funded program for homeless youth and young adults must endeavor to identify, encourage, and nurture each youth's strengths and abilities and demonstrate a commitment to youth-centered programming.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that there is a retirement savings access gap in Washington; that Americans reach the median salary four years later than they did in 1980 and therefore have four fewer years of savings opportunities; and that one in six Americans retire in poverty. Employees who are unable to effectively build their retirement savings risk living on low incomes in their elderly years and are more likely to become dependent on state services. Further, small businesses, which employ more than forty percent of private sector employees in Washington, often choose not to offer retirement plans to employees due to concerns about costs, administrative burdens, and potential liability that they believe such plans would place on their business. In response, the legislature recognizes the work of the federal government in addressing these issues by establishing the myRA program: A safe, affordable, and accessible retirement vehicle designed to remove barriers to retirement savings. In addition, the legislature recognizes that many private financial services firms in Washington currently offer high quality retirement options for small businesses and their employees.</p>
<p>The Washington small business retirement marketplace will remove barriers to entry into the retirement market for small businesses by educating small employers on plan availability and promoting, without mandated participation, qualified, low-cost, low-burden retirement savings vehicles and myRA. The marketplace furthers greater retirement plan access for the residents of Washington while ensuring that individuals participating in these retirement plans will have all the protections offered by the employee retirement income security act. Further, the Washington small business retirement marketplace will not pose any significant financial burden upon taxpayers. The Washington small business retirement marketplace will be the best way for Washington to close the retirement savings access gap, protect the fiscal stability of the state and its citizens well into the future, and further cement its place as a national leader in retirement and investor promotion and protection. The marketplace will educate and promote retirement saving among employees and in particular market to small employers with fifty or fewer employees.</p>
