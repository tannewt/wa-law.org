<p>There shall be a fund, known as the &quot;liquor revolving fund,&quot; which shall consist of all license fees, permit fees, penalties, forfeitures, and all other moneys, income, or revenue received by the board. The state treasurer shall be custodian of the fund. All moneys received by the board or any employee thereof, except for change funds and an amount of petty cash as fixed by the board within the authority of law shall be deposited each day in a depository approved by the state treasurer and transferred to the state treasurer to be credited to the liquor revolving fund. During the 2009-2011 fiscal biennium, the legislature may transfer funds from the liquor revolving account [fund] to the state general fund and may direct an additional amount of liquor profits to be distributed to local governments. Neither the transfer of funds nor the additional distribution of liquor profits to local governments during the 2009-2011 fiscal biennium may reduce the excess fund distributions that otherwise would occur under RCW 66.08.190. During the 2011-2013 fiscal biennium, the state treasurer shall transfer from the liquor revolving fund to the state general fund forty-two million five hundred thousand dollars for fiscal year 2012 and forty-two million five hundred thousand dollars for fiscal year 2013. The transfer during the 2011-2013 fiscal biennium may not reduce the excess fund distributions that otherwise would occur under RCW 66.08.190. Sales to licensees are exempt from any liquor price increases that may result from the transfer of funds from the liquor revolving fund to the state general fund during the 2011-2013 fiscal biennium. Disbursements from the revolving fund shall be on authorization of the board or a duly authorized representative thereof. During the 2017-2019 fiscal biennium, the legislature may also appropriate from the account for local government studies. In order to maintain an effective expenditure and revenue control the liquor revolving fund shall be subject in all respects to chapter 43.88 RCW but no appropriation shall be required to permit expenditures and payment of obligations from such fund. During the 2013-2015 and 2015-2017 fiscal biennia, the legislature may transfer from the liquor revolving fund to the state general fund such amounts as reflect the excess fund balance of the account.</p>

<p>With respect to the distribution of funds to the counties, the computations for distribution must be made by the state agency responsible for collecting the same as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The share coming to each eligible county must be determined by a division among the eligible counties according to the relation which the population of the unincorporated area of such eligible county, as last determined by the office of financial management, bears to the population of the total combined unincorporated areas of all eligible counties, as determined by the office of financial management. However, no county in which the sale of liquor is forbidden in the unincorporated area thereof as the result of an election is entitled to share in such distribution. &quot;Unincorporated area&quot; means all that portion of any county not included within the limits of incorporated cities and towns.</p>

<li>
<p>When a special county census has been conducted for the purpose of determining the population base of a county's unincorporated area for use in the distribution of liquor funds, the census figure becomes effective for the purpose of distributing funds as of the official census date once the census results have been certified by the office of financial management and officially submitted to the office of the secretary of state.</p>

<li>
<p>The licensing and enforcement system modernization project account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. All receipts from *RCW 66.08.2601 and 66.08.2602 must be deposited into the account. Expenditures from the account may be only used for the expenses of replacing and modernizing the board's licensing, enforcement, and imaging system. The expenditures may be expended for automation of licenses and permits, electronic payments, data warehousing, project management and system testing, consulting, contracting, and staff time, and any necessary data conversion, software, hardware, and related equipment costs. Before making expenditures from the account, the board must conduct a thorough business process examination to ensure the new system provides efficient and effective service delivery. As part of the examination, the board must evaluate and articulate how any new system procurement serves the current and future needs of the internal and external stakeholders, the customers, and the public. Only the director of the board or the director's designee may authorize expenditures from the account. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures.</p>
