The legislature intends for the legislative auditor to determine that the incentive has achieved its desired outcomes if the following objectives are achieved:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Installation of one hundred fifteen megawatts of solar photovoltaic capacity by participants in the incentive program between July 1, 2017, and June 30, 2021; and</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The purpose of a shared commercial solar project is to provide an entry point in solar utilization by large load customers in a manner that achieves economies of scale and maximizes system performance without limitations posed by on-site systems where sun exposure is not optimal or structural and other site deficiencies preclude solar development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning July 1, 2017, a utility may, at its discretion, organize and administer a shared commercial solar project as provided in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A shared commercial solar project must have a direct current nameplate capacity greater than one megawatt and no more than five megawatts and must have at least five participants. To receive incentive payments under RCW 82.16.165, each participant must be a customer of the utility providing service at the situs of the shared commercial solar project and must be located in the state of Washington.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The administrator of a shared commercial solar project must administer the project in a transparent manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The administrator of a shared commercial solar project may establish a reasonable fee to cover costs incurred in organizing and administering the shared commercial solar project. Project participants, prior to making the commitment to participate in the project, must be given clear and conspicuous notice of the fees charged by the administrator as authorized under this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The administrator of a shared commercial solar project must submit to the Washington State University extension energy program at the time it submits an application allowed under RCW 82.16.165(1) project design details, including project location, output capacity, equipment list, and interconnection information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The administrator of a shared commercial solar project must provide each project participant with a disclosure form containing all material terms and conditions of participation in the project, including but not limited to the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>All recurring and nonrecurring charges;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A description of the billing and payment procedures;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Production projections and a description of the methodology used to develop the projections;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An estimate of the project participant's share of any incentive payment over the life of the contract;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A description of contract terms that relate to project underperformance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contract provisions regulating the disposition or transfer of the project participant's interest in the project, including any potential costs associated with such a transfer;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contact information for questions and complaints; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any other terms and conditions of the services provided by the administrator.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a utility opts to contract with a nonutility administrator to offer a shared commercial solar program, the utility must publish, without disclosing proprietary information, the name of the nonutility administrator contracted by the utility as part of its shared commercial solar program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to meet the intent of chapter 36, Laws of 2017 3rd sp. sess. of promoting a sustainable, local renewable energy industry, the legislature prefers award of the majority of the installation of shared commercial solar projects be given to contractors based in Washington state. In the event the majority of the installation of a shared commercial solar project is awarded to out-of-state contractors, the administrator must submit to the Washington State University extension energy program the reasons for using out-of-state contractors, the percentage of installation work performed by out-of-state contractors, and a cost comparison of the installation services performed by out-of-state contractors against the same services performed by Washington-based contractors.</p>
