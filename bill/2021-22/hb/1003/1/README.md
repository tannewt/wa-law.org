## Section 1
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [29A.36](/rcw/29A_elections/29A.36_ballots_and_other_voting_forms.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/29A_elections/29A.36_ballots_and_other_voting_forms.md) for context.

1. The secretary of state shall design a watermark for inclusion on official ballots in any election subject to this title. The watermark must be sufficient to prove that the ballot is an official ballot and not a reproduction.

2. Each ballot printed by a county auditor must include the watermark designed under this section.

3. This section does not preclude a county auditor from printing a replacement ballot when requested by a voter under this title. Replacement ballots must be identical in form to all original official ballots, including a watermark.
