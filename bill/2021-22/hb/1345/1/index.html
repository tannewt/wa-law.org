<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature makes the following findings:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Nicotine is a highly addictive substance, particularly for children and youth under 21 years of age, whose brains are still developing. Currently, there is no limit in the United States on nicotine levels of vapor products. While other nations limit the nicotine content of vapor products to not more than two percent nicotine, vapor products commonly sold in this state and accessed by youth contain five percent nicotine. Vapor products that deliver high levels of nicotine are fueling youth addiction to nicotine and have created an epidemic. The 2019 national youth tobacco survey found that about 27 percent of high school students reported current use of electronic cigarettes and, among electronic cigarette users, about one-third reported using electronic cigarettes on 20 or more of the preceding 30 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research consistently shows that flavors and associated advertising contribute to the appeal, initiation, and use of tobacco products, including vapor products, particularly among adolescents and young adults. Evidence also suggests that the 2009 flavored cigarette ban did achieve its objective of reducing adolescent tobacco use, but effects were likely diminished by the continued availability of menthol cigarettes and other flavored tobacco products. Preliminary data from the national youth tobacco survey show that more than one-quarter of high school students were current electronic cigarette users in 2019 and the overwhelming majority of youth electronic cigarette users cited the use of popular fruit and menthol or mint flavors. A health impact review performed by the state board of health in 2019 concluded that eliminating flavored vapor products would likely decrease initiation and use of vapor products and other tobacco products among youth and young adults, thereby improving health outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Early research from Stanford University school of medicine indicates that teenagers and young adults that vape are five to seven times more likely to be infected with COVID-19 compared to those who do not use vapor products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the long-term health effects of vapor products are unknown, current data suggests they are harmful to human health. Vapor products have been shown to impair lung function in several ways, such as by inhibiting ciliary beating, impairing immune function, and causing toxicity to epithelial cells.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to ban the sale of flavored vapor products and enact additional regulatory protections to protect the health of youth and young adults in Washington state.</p>

<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/70_public_health_and_safety/70.345_vapor_products.html">70.345.020</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/70_public_health_and_safety/70.345_vapor_products.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The licenses issuable by the board under this chapter are as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A vapor product retailer's license;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A vapor product distributor's license;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A vapor product manufacturer's license; and</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A vapor product delivery sale license.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application for the licenses must be made through the business licensing system under chapter 19.02 RCW. The board may adopt rules regarding the regulation of the licenses <strong>and licensees</strong>. The board may refuse to issue any license under this chapter if the board has reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has willfully withheld information requested for the purpose of determining the eligibility of the applicant to receive a license, or if the board has reasonable cause to believe that information submitted in the application is false or misleading or is not made in good faith. In addition, for the purpose of reviewing an application for a <strong>manufacturer's license,</strong> distributor's license, retailer's license, or delivery seller's license, and for considering the denial, suspension, or revocation of any such license, the board may consider criminal conduct of the applicant, including an administrative violation history record with the board and a criminal history record information check within the previous five years, in any state, tribal, or federal jurisdiction in the United States, its territories, or possessions, and the provisions of RCW 9.95.240 and chapter 9.96A RCW do not apply to such cases. The board may, in its discretion, issue or refuse to issue <strong>a manufacturer's license,</strong> retailer's license, distributor's license, <strong>or</strong> delivery sale license subject to the provisions of RCW 70.155.100.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application processes for the retailer license and the distributor license, and any forms used for such processes, must allow the applicant to simultaneously apply for a delivery sale license without requiring the applicant to undergo a separate licensing application process in order to be licensed to conduct delivery sales. However, a delivery sale license obtained in conjunction with a retailer or distributor license under this subsection remains a separate license subject to the delivery sale licensing fee established under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No person may qualify for a <strong>manufacturer's license,</strong> retailer's license, distributor's license, or delivery sale license under this section without first undergoing a criminal background check. The background check must be performed by the board and must disclose any criminal conduct within the previous five years in any state, tribal, or federal jurisdiction in the United States, its territories, or possessions. If the applicant or licensee also has a license issued under chapter 66.24, 69.50, 82.24, or 82.26 RCW, the background check done under the authority of chapter 66.24, 69.50, 82.24, or 82.26 RCW satisfies the requirements of this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each license issued under this chapter expires on the business license expiration date. The license must be continued annually if the licensee has paid the required fee and complied with all the provisions of this chapter and the rules of the board adopted pursuant to this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each license and any other evidence of the license required under this chapter must be exhibited in each place of business for which it is issued and in the manner required for the display of a business license.</p>
