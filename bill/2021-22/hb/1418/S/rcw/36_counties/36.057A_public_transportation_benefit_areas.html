<p>The county legislative authority of every county with a population of forty thousand or more shall, and the legislative authority of every other county may, within ninety days of July 1, 1975, and as often thereafter as it deems necessary, and upon thirty days prior written notice addressed to the legislative body of each city within the county and with thirty days public notice, convene a public transportation improvement conference to be attended by an elected representative selected by the legislative body of each city, within such county, and by the county legislative authority. Such conference shall be for the purpose of evaluating the need for and the desirability of the creation of a public transportation benefit area within certain incorporated and unincorporated portions of the county to provide public transportation services within such area. In those counties where county officials believe the need for public transportation service extends across county boundaries so as to provide public transportation service in a metropolitan area, the county legislative bodies of two or more neighboring counties may elect to convene a multi-county conference. In addition, countywide conferences may be convened by resolution of the legislative bodies of two or more cities within the county, not to exceed one in any twelve-month period, or a petition signed by at least ten percent of the registered voters in the last general election of the city, county or city/county areas of a proposed benefit area. The chair of the conference shall be elected from the members at large.</p>

<p>Any conference which finds it desirable to establish a public transportation benefit area or change the boundaries of any existing public transportation benefit area shall fix a date for a public hearing thereon, or the legislative bodies of any two or more component cities or the county legislative body by resolution may require the public transportation improvement conference to fix a date for a public hearing thereon. Prior to the convening of the public hearing, the county governing body shall delineate the area of the county proposed to be included within the transportation benefit area, and shall furnish a copy of such delineation to each incorporated city within such area. Each city shall advise the county governing body, on a preliminary basis, of its desire to be included or excluded from the transportation benefit area by means of an ordinance adopted by the legislative body of that city. The county governing body shall cause the delineations to be revised to reflect the wishes of such incorporated cities. This delineation shall be considered by the conference at the public hearing for inclusion in the public transportation benefit area.</p>
<p>Notice of such hearing shall be published once a week for at least four consecutive weeks in one or more newspapers of general circulation within the area. The notice shall contain a description and map of the boundaries of the proposed public transportation benefit area and shall state the time and place of the hearing and the fact that any changes in the boundaries of the public transportation benefit area will be considered at such time and place. At such hearing or any continuation thereof, any interested person may appear and be heard on all matters relating to the effect of the formation of the proposed public transportation benefit area.</p>
<p>The conference may make such changes in the boundaries of the public transportation benefit area as they shall deem reasonable and proper, but may not delete any portion of the proposed area which will create an island of included or excluded lands, and may not delete a portion of any city. If the conference shall determine that any additional territory should be included in the public transportation benefit area, a second hearing shall be held and notice given in the same manner as for the original hearing. The conference may adjourn the hearing on the formation of a public transportation benefit area from time to time not exceeding thirty days in all.</p>
<p>Following the conclusion of such hearing the conference shall adopt a resolution fixing the boundaries of the proposed public transportation benefit area, declaring that the formation of the proposed public transportation benefit area will be conducive to the welfare and benefit of the persons and property therein.</p>
<p>Within thirty days of the adoption of such conference resolution, the county legislative authority of each county wherein a conference has established proposed boundaries of a public transportation benefit area, may by resolution, upon making a legislative finding that the proposed benefit area includes portions of the county which could not be reasonably expected to benefit from such benefit area or excludes portions of the county which could be reasonably expected to benefit from its creation, disapprove and terminate the establishment of such public transportation benefit area within such county.</p>

<p>At the time of its formation no public transportation benefit area may include only a part of any city, and every city shall be either wholly included or wholly excluded from the boundaries of such area. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if subsequent to the formation of a public transportation benefit area additional area became or will become a part of a component city by annexation, merger, or otherwise, the additional area shall be included within the boundaries of the transportation benefit area and be subject to all taxes and other liabilities and obligations of the public transportation benefit area. The component city shall be required to notify the public transportation benefit area at the time the city has added the additional area. Furthermore, notwithstanding any other provisions of law except as specifically provided in this section, if a city that is not a component city of the public transportation benefit area adds area to its boundaries that is within the boundaries of the public transportation benefit area, the area so added shall be deemed to be excluded from the public transportation benefit area: PROVIDED, That the public transportation benefit area shall be given notice of the city's intention to add such area. If a city extends its boundaries through annexation across a county boundary line and such extended boundaries include areas within the public transportation benefit area, then the entire area of the city within the county that is within the public transportation benefit area shall be included within the public transportation benefit area boundaries. Such area of the city in the public transportation benefit area shall be considered a component city of the public transportation benefit area corporation.</p>
<p>The boundaries of any public transportation benefit area shall follow school district lines or election precinct lines, as far as practicable. Only such areas shall be included which the conference determines could reasonably benefit from the provision of public transportation services. Except as provided in RCW 36.57A.140(2), only one public transportation benefit area may be created in any county.</p>

<p>Within sixty days of the establishment of the boundaries of the public transportation benefit area the members of the county legislative authority and the elected representative of each city within the area shall provide for the selection of the governing body of such area, the public transportation benefit area authority, which shall consist of elected officials selected by and serving at the pleasure of the governing bodies of component cities within the area and the county legislative authority of each county within the area. The members of the governing body of the public transportation benefit area, if the population of the county in which the public transportation benefit area is located is more than four hundred thousand and the county does not also contain a city with a population of seventy-five thousand or more operating a transit system pursuant to chapter 35.95 RCW, must be selected to assure proportional representation, based on population, of each of the component cities located within the public transportation benefit area and the unincorporated areas of the county located within the public transportation benefit area, to the extent possible within the restrictions placed on the size of the governing body of a public transportation benefit area. If necessary to assure such proportional representation, multiple cities may be represented by a single elected official from one of the cities. A majority of the governing board may not be selected to represent a single component city. If at the time a public transportation benefit area authority assumes the public transportation functions previously provided under the interlocal cooperation act (chapter 39.34 RCW) there are citizen positions on the governing board of the transit system, those positions may be retained as positions on the governing board of the public transportation benefit area authority.</p>
<p>Within such sixty-day period, any city may by resolution of its legislative body withdraw from participation in the public transportation benefit area. The county legislative authority and each city remaining in the public transportation benefit area may disapprove and prevent the establishment of any governing body of a public transportation benefit area if the composition thereof does not meet its approval.</p>
<p>In no case shall the governing body of a single county public transportation benefit area be greater than nine voting members and in the case of a multicounty area, fifteen voting members. Those cities within the public transportation benefit area and excluded from direct membership on the authority are hereby authorized to designate a member of the authority who shall be entitled to represent the interests of such city which is excluded from direct membership on the authority. The legislative body of such city shall notify the authority as to the determination of its authorized representative on the authority.</p>
<p>There is one nonvoting member of the public transportation benefit area authority. The nonvoting member is recommended by the labor organization representing the public transportation employees within the local public transportation system. If the public transportation employees are represented by more than one labor organization, all such labor organizations shall select the nonvoting member by majority vote. The nonvoting member shall comply with all governing bylaws and policies of the authority. The chair or cochairs of the authority shall exclude the nonvoting member from attending any executive session held for the purpose of discussing negotiations with labor organizations. The chair or cochairs may exclude the nonvoting member from attending any other executive session. The requirement that a nonvoting member be appointed to the governing body of a public transportation benefit area authority does not apply to an authority that has no employees represented by a labor union.</p>
<p>Each member of the authority is eligible to be reimbursed for travel expenses in accordance with RCW 43.03.050 and 43.03.060 and to receive compensation, as set by the authority, in an amount not to exceed forty-four dollars for each day during which the member attends official meetings of the authority or performs prescribed duties approved by the chair of the authority. Except that the authority may, by resolution, increase the payment of per diem compensation to each member from forty-four dollars up to ninety dollars per day or portion of a day for actual attendance at board meetings or for performance of other official services or duties on behalf of the authority. In no event may a member be compensated in any year for more than seventy-five days, except the chair who may be paid compensation for not more than one hundred days: PROVIDED, That compensation shall not be paid to an elected official or employee of federal, state, or local government who is receiving regular full-time compensation from such government for attending meetings and performing prescribed duties of the authority.</p>
<p>The dollar thresholds established in this section must be adjusted for inflation by the office of financial management every five years, beginning January 1, 2024, based upon changes in the consumer price index during that time period. &quot;Consumer price index&quot; means, for any calendar year, that year's annual average consumer price index, for Washington state, for wage earners and clerical workers, all items, compiled by the bureau of labor and statistics, United States department of labor. If the bureau of labor and statistics develops more than one consumer price index for areas within the state, the index covering the greatest number of people, covering areas exclusively within the boundaries of the state, and including all items shall be used for the adjustments for inflation in this section. The office of financial management must calculate the new dollar threshold and transmit it to the office of the code reviser for publication in the Washington State Register at least one month before the new dollar threshold is to take effect.</p>

<p>To acquire by purchase, condemnation, gift, or grant and to lease, construct, add to, improve, replace, repair, maintain, operate, and regulate the use of transportation facilities and properties within or without the public transportation benefit area or the state, including systems of surface, underground, or overhead railways, tramways, buses, or any other means of local transportation except taxis, and including escalators, moving sidewalks, or other people-moving systems, passenger terminal and parking facilities and properties, and such other facilities and properties as may be necessary for passenger and vehicular access to and from such people-moving systems, terminal and parking facilities and properties, together with all lands, rights-of-way, property, equipment, and accessories necessary for such systems and facilities. Public transportation facilities and properties which are owned by any city may be acquired or used by the public transportation benefit area authority only with the consent of the city council of the city owning such facilities. Cities are hereby authorized to convey or lease such facilities to a public transportation benefit area authority or to contract for their joint use on such terms as may be fixed by agreement between the city council of such city and the public transportation benefit area authority, without submitting the matter to the voters of such city.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To fix rates, tolls, fares, and charges for the use of such facilities and to establish various routes and classes of service.
