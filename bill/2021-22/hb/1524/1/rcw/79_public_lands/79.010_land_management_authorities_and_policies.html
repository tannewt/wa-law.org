<p>In the management of public lands lying within the limits of any watershed over and through which is derived the water supply of any city or town, the department may alter its land management practices to provide water with qualities exceeding standards established for intrastate and interstate waters by the department of ecology. However, if such alterations of management by the department reduce revenues from, increase costs of management of, or reduce the market value of public lands the city or town requesting such alterations shall fully compensate the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall initiate a pilot project for the municipal watershed delineated by the Lake Whatcom hydrographic boundaries to determine what factors need to be considered to achieve water quality standards beyond those required under chapter 90.48 RCW and what additional management actions can be taken on state trust lands that can contribute to such higher water quality standards. The department shall establish an advisory committee consisting of a representative each of the city of Bellingham, Whatcom county, the Whatcom county water district 10, the department of ecology, the department of fish and wildlife, and the department of health, and three general citizen members to assist in this pilot project. In the event of differences of opinion among the members of the advisory committee, the committee shall attempt to resolve these differences through various means, including the retention of facilitation or mediation services.</p>

<li>
<p>The pilot project in subsection (2) of this section shall be completed by June 30, 2000. The department shall defer all timber sales in the Lake Whatcom hydrographic boundaries until the pilot project is complete.</p>

<li>
<p>The exclusive manner, notwithstanding any provisions of the law to the contrary, for any city or town to acquire by condemnation ownership or rights in public lands for watershed purposes within the limits of any watershed over or through which is derived the water supply of any city or town shall be to petition the legislature for such authority. Nothing in RCW 79.44.003 and this chapter shall be construed to affect any existing rights held by third parties in the lands applied for.</p>

<p>At no time shall the amount due the state for timber actually cut and removed exceed the amount of the deposit as set forth in this section.

<p>The recreational trail policy developed by the department under this section must provide that recreational trails be developed and managed in a manner that ensures the following principles are satisfied:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Causing the least impact to the land;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing environmental and water quality protection; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintaining the lowest construction and maintenance costs that are reasonable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department should use trail standards developed by the United States forest service as primary guidelines for trail construction and maintenance. However, the department must develop its own construction standards and best management practices when the primary guidelines are deemed insufficient or inapplicable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trails developed or maintained consistent with a recreational trail policy developed under this section must comply with <strong>this title</strong> and all applicable state laws and rules, including those administered by the department of ecology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After developing the recreational trail policy required in this section, and when developing or assessing recreational trail systems, the department should evaluate existing nondesignated trails for compliance with trail standards and incorporate those trails, when compliant and consistent with the standards, into comprehensive recreational management plans.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>When appropriate, the department should incorporate public input on new and existing trail systems, and if deemed appropriate, the department should support formal or informal public forums to allow members of the local community to share concerns and ideas or organize themselves for volunteer trail maintenance.</p>

<p>A recreational trail policy developed by the department under this section must provide for the department to enter into a hold harmless agreement with all volunteers coordinating with the department under the policy or enter into other agreements that limit the department's liability from the actions of volunteers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever volunteers or volunteer organizations are authorized to perform activities or carry out projects under this subsection, the volunteers or members of the organizations may not be considered employees or agents of the department and the department is not subject to any liability whatsoever arising out of volunteer activities or projects. The liability of the department to volunteers and members of the volunteer organizations is limited in the same manner as provided for in RCW 4.24.210.</p>

<p>Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, consistent with the prioritization policy developed pursuant to RCW 79.10.520, and to the extent feasible given all applicable trust responsibilities, the department must identify areas of state lands and state forestlands that would benefit from forest health treatments at the landscape level for the next twenty years, and ones that would benefit the most during the following six years, and prioritize and list specific lands for treatment during the subsequent biennium. The department shall update this list by November 15th of each even-numbered year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To expedite initial treatments under chapter 248, Laws of 2017, for the 2017-2019 biennium the department may prioritize and, if funds are appropriated for this purpose, address lands for treatment that are currently identified by the department as pilot treatment projects.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to develop a prioritized list that evaluates forest health treatments at a landscape scale, the department should consult with and take into account the land management plans and activities of nearby landowners, if available, including federal agencies, other state agencies, local governments, tribes, and private property owners, in addition to any statewide assessments done by the department. The department may include federally, locally, or privately managed lands on the list. The department may fund treatment on these lands provided that the treatments are funded with nontrust funds, and provided that the treatments produce a net benefit to the health of state lands and state forestlands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By December 1st of each even-numbered year, the department must submit a report to the legislature consistent with the requirements of RCW 43.01.036, to the office of financial management, and to the board of natural resources. The report must include:</p>

<p>A brief summary of the department's progress towards treating the state lands and state forestlands included on the preceding biennium's prioritization list;</p>

<li>
<p>Recommended funding amounts required to carry out the treatment activities for the next biennium, including a summary of potential nontimber revenue sources that could finance specific forest health treatments pursuant to RCW 79.10.520, including but not limited to ecosystem services such as water and carbon sequestration as well as insurance and fire mitigation; and</p>
