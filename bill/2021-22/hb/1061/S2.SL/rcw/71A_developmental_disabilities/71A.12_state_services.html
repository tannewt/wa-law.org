<p>It is declared to be the policy of the state to authorize the secretary to develop and coordinate state services for persons with developmental disabilities; to encourage research and staff training for state and local personnel working with persons with developmental disabilities; and to cooperate with communities to encourage the establishment and development of services to persons with developmental disabilities through locally administered and locally controlled programs.</p>
<p>The complexities of developmental disabilities require the services of many state departments as well as those of the community. Services should be planned and provided as a part of a continuum. A pattern of facilities and services should be established, within appropriations designated for this purpose, which is sufficiently complete to meet the needs of each person with a developmental disability regardless of age or degree of disability, and at each stage of the person's development.</p>

<li>
<p>To the extent that state, federal, or other funds designated for services to persons with developmental disabilities are available, the secretary shall provide every eligible person with habilitative services suited to the person's needs, regardless of age or degree of developmental disability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The secretary shall provide persons who receive services with the opportunity for integration with persons without disabilities and persons with less acute disabilities to the greatest extent possible.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that among those persons who endanger the safety of others by committing crimes are a small number of persons with developmental disabilities. While their conduct is not typical of the vast majority of persons with developmental disabilities who are responsible citizens, for their own welfare and for the safety of others the state may need to exercise control over those few dangerous individuals who are developmentally disabled, have been charged with crimes that involve a threat to public safety or security, and have been found either incompetent to stand trial or not guilty by reason of insanity.</p>
<p>The legislature finds, however, that the use of civil commitment procedures under chapter 71.05 RCW to effect state control over dangerous developmentally disabled persons has resulted in their commitment to institutions for the mentally ill. The legislature finds that existing programs in mental institutions may be inappropriate for persons who are developmentally disabled because the services provided in mental institutions are oriented to persons with mental illness, a condition not necessarily associated with developmental disabilities.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature believes that, where appropriate, and subject to available funds, persons with developmental disabilities who have been charged with crimes that involve a threat to public safety or security and have been found incompetent to stand trial or not guilty by reason of insanity should receive state services addressing their needs, that such services must be provided in conformance with an individual habilitation plan, and that their initial treatment should be separate and discrete from treatment for persons involved in any other treatment or habilitation program in a manner consistent with the needs of public safety.</p>

<p>The enforcement standards in this section apply to all certified residential services and support providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department is authorized to take one or more of the enforcement actions listed in subsection (3) of this section when the department finds that a provider of residential services and support with whom the department entered into an agreement under this chapter has:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Failed or refused to comply with the health and safety related requirements of this chapter, chapter 74.34 RCW, or the rules adopted under these chapters;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failed or refused to cooperate with the certification process;</p>

<li>
<p>Failed to comply with any applicable requirements regarding vulnerable adults under chapter 74.34 RCW; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowingly, or with reason to know, made a false statement of material fact related to certification or contracting with the department, or in any matter under investigation by the department.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Refuse to certify the provider;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decertify or refuse to renew the certification of a provider;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impose reasonable conditions on a provider's certification status such as correction within a time specified in the statement of deficiency, training, and limits on the type of client the provider may serve;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suspend department referrals to the provider;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suspend the provider from accepting clients with specified needs by imposing a limited stop placement; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Require a provider to implement a plan of correction approved by the department and to cooperate with subsequent monitoring of the provider's progress.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the event a provider fails to implement the plan or plans of correction or fails to make a correction imposed under subsection (3)(c) of this section or fails to cooperate with subsequent monitoring, the department may impose civil penalties of up to one hundred dollars per day per violation and up to three thousand dollars per violation from the compliance date identified in the approved plan of correction or the statement of deficiencies. If a provider fails to submit a plan of correction for approval by the department, the department may impose civil penalties as described in this subsection starting ten days after the provider received the statement of deficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When determining the appropriate enforcement action or actions under subsection (3) of this section, the department must select actions commensurate with the seriousness of the harm or threat of harm to the persons being served by the provider. Further, the department may take enforcement actions that are more severe for violations that are uncorrected, repeated, pervasive, or which present a serious threat of harm to the health, safety, or welfare of persons served by the provider. By January 1, 2016, the department shall by rule develop criteria for the selection and implementation of enforcement actions authorized in subsection (3) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the department orders a stop placement, the provider may not accept any new clients until the stop placement order is terminated. If the department orders a limited stop placement, the provider may not accept clients with specific needs or at a specific site until the limited stop placement order is terminated. The department shall terminate the stop placement or limited stop placement when:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The violations necessitating the stop placement or limited stop placement have been corrected; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provider exhibits the capacity to maintain correction of the violations previously found. However, if upon revisiting the provider, the department finds new violations that the department reasonably believes will result in a new stop placement or new limited stop placement, the previous stop placement or limited stop placement remains in effect until the new stop placement or new limited stop placement is imposed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a department finding of a violation for which a stop placement or limited stop placement has been imposed, the department shall make an on-site revisit of the provider within fifteen working days from the date the provider notifies the department of the correction to ensure correction of the violation. For violations that are serious, recurring, or uncorrected following a previous citation and that create actual or threatened harm to one or more clients' well-being, including violations of clients' rights, the department shall make an on-site revisit as soon as appropriate to ensure correction of the violation. Verification of correction of all other violations may be made by either a department on-site revisit or by written or photographic documentation found by the department to be credible. This subsection does not prevent the department from enforcing certification suspensions or revocations. Nothing in this subsection interferes with or diminishes the department's authority and duty to ensure that a provider adequately cares for clients, including making departmental on-site revisits as needed to ensure that the provider protects clients and enforcing compliance with this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provisions of chapter 34.05 RCW apply to enforcement actions under this section. The certified provider or its designee has the right to an informal dispute resolution process to dispute any violation found or enforcement remedy imposed by the department during a certification inspection or complaint investigation. The purpose of the informal dispute resolution process is to provide an opportunity for an exchange of information that may lead to the modification, deletion, or removal of a violation, parts of a violation, or an enforcement remedy imposed by the department. Except for the imposition of civil penalties, the effective date of enforcement actions may not be delayed or suspended pending any hearing or informal dispute resolution process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The enforcement actions and penalties authorized in this section are not exclusive or exhaustive and nothing in this section prohibits the department from taking any other action authorized in statute, rule, or under the terms of a contract with the provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A separate residential services and support account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. All receipts from civil penalties imposed under this section must be deposited into the account. Only the director or the director's designee may authorize expenditures from the account. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures. The department shall use the special account only for promoting the quality of life and care of clients receiving care and services from the certified providers.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The developmental disabilities administration must develop a process to determine which of its clients who receive an annual developmental disabilities assessment are at highest risk of abuse or neglect. The administration may consider factors such as:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Whether the client lives with the client's caregiver and receives no other developmental disabilities administration services, or whether the client is largely or entirely dependent on a sole caregiver for assistance, and the caregiver is largely or entirely dependent on the client for his or her income;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the client has limited ability to supervise the caregiver, to express himself or herself verbally, has few community contacts, or no independent person outside the home is identified to assist the client;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the client has experienced a destabilizing event such as hospitalization, arrest, or victimization;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the client has been the subject of an adult protective services or child protective services referral in the past year; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the client lives in an environment that jeopardizes personal safety.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The developmental disabilities administration must visit those clients identified as having the highest risk of abuse or neglect at least once every four months, including unannounced visits as needed. This unannounced visit may replace a scheduled visit; however if the case manager is unable to meet with the client, a follow-up visit must be scheduled. A client may refuse to allow an unannounced visit to take place, but this fact must be noted.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that the residential services and supports program administered by the department of social and health services under RCW 71A.12.040 and chapter 388-101 WAC has experienced significant growth and that additional funds are needed to enable the department to aggressively investigate and resolve complaints of abuse, neglect, abandonment, and financial exploitation of the vulnerable populations served by the program. The legislature intends to address current funding levels that limit the department of social and health services' ability to promote vulnerable adult protections in the program. The legislature further intends that the cost of complaint investigation should be supported by an appropriate certification fee paid by the regulated businesses.</p>
