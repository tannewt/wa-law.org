# House Bill 1465

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/House%20Bills/1465.xml)
## Section 1
(1) The legislature finds that the COVID-19 recession has threatened the housing security of Washingtonians across our state. The legislature intends to provide foreclosure prevention and homelessness prevention assistance to Washington residents throughout the state with increased funding for the foreclosure fairness account and the funding of a new equity in housing account to enable foreclosure prevention, rental assistance, and housing services.
(2) The legislature finds that the racial wealth gap negatively affects Black and African-American families across the United States at an astonishing rate. According to a 2016 brookings institute report, the median net worth of white households was nearly 10 times that of Black families. The legislature finds that Black families and families of color throughout Washington experience deep wealth and income disparities.
(3) The legislature further finds that homeownership is critical to the accumulation of wealth, and Black family homeownership rates are half of those of white families. Affordable homeownership can be a powerful way to strengthen housing and economic stability for future generations. In 2018, 31.8 percent of Black homeowners, 31.4 percent of Asian homeowners, 34 percent of Latino homeowners, and 39.1 percent of indigenous homeowners experienced a cost burden or paid more than 30 percent of total income on their home.
(4) The legislature further finds that many Washingtonians, mainly Black and indigenous individuals and families, face systemic barriers to affordable homeownership and to building generational wealth. Nationally, Black family homeownership dropped five percent compared to one percent for white families between 2001 and 2016. Within the same years, homeownership among single Black men and Black women declined at nearly the same rate, according to the urban institute. The legislature finds that this significantly impacts Black and indigenous families and their ability to pass a home or home equity on to the next generation, ultimately contributing to intergenerational poverty. Black and indigenous families experience reduced access to this wealth-building tool, ultimately perpetuating lower rates of intergenerational mobility. The legislature finds that while nine and eight-tenths percent of Washingtonians live under the federal poverty threshold, 16.9 percent are Black, 15.7 percent are Latino, and 18.6 percent are native.
(5) The legislature finds that the historical impacts of systemic housing discrimination like redlining continue to maintain the racial wealth gap between white families and families of color, racial disparities in poverty, incarceration rates, and access to health care, which perpetuates racial disparities in homelessness. The legislature also finds that Black people are overrepresented by three-fold among those experiencing homelessness largely due to historical and structural racism that has led to deep poverty through many generations. According to a 2020 report by the national alliance to end homelessness, Black individuals represent 13 percent of the total United States population, but account for 40 percent of people experiencing homelessness and over 50 percent of families with children experiencing homelessness. The legislature finds that incarceration rates among Black individuals tripled between 1968 and 2016, ultimately preventing many from passing background checks for housing and employment. Moreover, the legislature finds that people of color are more likely to be without health insurance than white individuals and are less likely to seek treatment when needed due to the historical mistrust of the medical community.
(6) Further, the legislature finds that the COVID-19 pandemic has further disproportionately affected both the physical and financial health of Black families and families of color, inhibiting progress in upward mobility. Black, Latino, and other families of color have been the hardest hit by efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 due to occupational segregation, overrepresentation in low-wage jobs, and jobs that cannot be worked remotely. In April, the Black unemployment rate reached 16.7 percent while the Latino unemployment rate reached 18.9 percent. Further, Black and Latino individuals are more likely to experience an increase in housing instability related to COVID-19 layoffs due to higher rates of financial insecurity and less relative wealth.
(7) Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to restructure the estate tax which taxes the benefits of accumulated wealth and direct some of the proceeds to programs that directly address foreclosure prevention and services and homelessness prevention and services, with priority for agencies, programs, and services that address current and historical racial inequities.

    b. If any property in the decedent's estate is located outside of Washington, the amount of tax is the amount determined in (a) of this subsection multiplied by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the value of the property located in Washington. The denominator of the fraction is the value of the decedent's gross estate. Property qualifying for a deduction under RCW 83.100.046 must be excluded from the numerator and denominator of the fraction.

3. The tax imposed under this section is a stand-alone estate tax that incorporates only those provisions of the internal revenue code as amended or renumbered as of January 1, 2005, that do not conflict with the provisions of this chapter. The tax imposed under this chapter is independent of any federal estate tax obligation and is not affected by termination of the federal estate tax.


## Section 4
> This section modifies existing section [83.100.047](/rcw/83_estate_taxation/83.100_estate_and_transfer_tax_act.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/83_estate_taxation/83.100_estate_and_transfer_tax_act.md) for context.

1. [Empty]

    a. If the federal taxable estate on the federal return is determined by making an election under section 2056 or 2056A of the internal revenue code, or if no federal return is required to be filed, the department may provide by rule for a separate election on the Washington return, consistent with section 2056 or 2056A of the internal revenue code and (b) of this subsection, for the purpose of determining the amount of tax due under this chapter. The election is binding on the estate and the beneficiaries, consistent with the internal revenue code and (b) of this subsection. All other elections or valuations on the Washington return must be made in a manner consistent with the federal return, if a federal return is required, and such rules as the department may provide.

    b. The department must provide by rule that a state registered domestic partner is deemed to be a surviving spouse and entitled to a deduction from the Washington taxable estate for any interest passing from the decedent to his or her domestic partner, consistent with section 2056 or 2056A of the internal revenue code but regardless of whether such interest would be deductible from the federal gross estate under section 2056 or 2056A of the internal revenue code.

2. [Empty]

    a. Amounts deducted for federal income tax purposes under section 642(g) of the internal revenue code of 1986 are not allowed as deductions in computing the amount of tax due under this chapter.

        ii. **Seventy-five percent of any amount in excess of $100,000,000 deducted under section 2055 of the internal revenue code.**

3. Notwithstanding any department rule, if a taxpayer makes an election consistent with section 2056 of the internal revenue code as permitted under this section, the taxpayer's Washington taxable estate, and the surviving spouse's Washington taxable estate, must be adjusted as follows:

    a. For the taxpayer that made the election, any amount deducted by reason of section 2056(b)(7) of the internal revenue code is added to, and the value of property for which a Washington election under this section was made is deducted from, the Washington taxable estate.

    b. For the estate of the surviving spouse, the amount included in the estate's gross estate pursuant to section 2044 (a) and (b)(1)(A) of the internal revenue code is deducted from, and the value of any property for which an election under this section was previously made is added to, the Washington taxable estate.

    i. For purposes of this subsection, a qualified heir may not be treated as disposing of an interest described in section 2057(e)(1)(A) of the internal revenue code by reason of ceasing to be engaged in a trade or business so long as the property to which such interest relates is used in a trade or business by any member of the qualified heir's family.

4. [Empty]
