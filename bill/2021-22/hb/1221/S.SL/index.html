When considering whether a clear and present danger exists, evidence of a parent's substance abuse as a contributing factor to negligent treatment or maltreatment shall be given great weight.

<p>At the commencement of the hearing, the court shall notify the parent, guardian, or custodian of the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The parent, guardian, or custodian has the right to a shelter care hearing;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nature of the shelter care hearing, the rights of the parents, and the proceedings that will follow; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the parent, guardian, or custodian is not represented by counsel, the right to be represented. If the parent, guardian, or custodian is indigent, the court shall appoint counsel as provided in RCW 13.34.090; and</p>

<p>If a parent, guardian, or legal custodian desires to waive the shelter care hearing, the court shall determine, on the record and with the parties present, whether such waiver is knowing and voluntary. A parent may not waive his or her right to the shelter care hearing unless he or she appears in court and the court determines that the waiver is knowing and voluntary. Regardless of whether the court accepts the parental waiver of the shelter care hearing, the court must provide notice to the parents of their rights required under (a) of this subsection and make the finding required under subsection (4) of this section.</p>

<li>
<p>At the shelter care hearing the court shall examine the need for shelter care and inquire into the status of the case. The paramount consideration for the court shall be the health, welfare, and safety of the child. At a minimum, the court shall inquire into the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Whether the notice required under RCW 13.34.062 was given to all known parents, guardians, or legal custodians of the child. The court shall make an express finding as to whether the notice required under RCW 13.34.062 was given to the parent, guardian, or legal custodian. If actual notice was not given to the parent, guardian, or legal custodian and the whereabouts of such person is known or can be ascertained, the court shall order the department to make reasonable efforts to advise the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of the status of the case, including the date and time of any subsequent hearings, and their rights under RCW 13.34.090;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the child can be safely returned home while the adjudication of the dependency is pending;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What efforts have been made to place the child with a relative. The court shall ask the parents whether the department discussed with them the placement of the child with a relative or other suitable person described in RCW 13.34.130(1)(b) and shall determine what efforts have been made toward such a placement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What services were provided to the family to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from the child's home. If the dependency petition or other information before the court alleges that <strong>experiencing</strong> homelessness or the lack of suitable housing was a significant factor contributing to the removal of the child, the court shall inquire as to whether housing assistance was provided to the family to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child or children;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the placement proposed by the department the least disruptive and most family-like setting that meets the needs of the child;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether it is in the best interest of the child to remain enrolled in the school, developmental program, or child care the child was in prior to placement and what efforts have been made to maintain the child in the school, program, or child care if it would be in the best interest of the child to remain in the same school, program, or child care;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appointment of a guardian ad litem or attorney;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the child is or may be an Indian child as defined in RCW 13.38.040, whether the provisions of the federal Indian child welfare act or chapter 13.38 RCW apply, and whether there is compliance with the federal Indian child welfare act and chapter 13.38 RCW, including notice to the child's tribe;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether, as provided in RCW 26.44.063, restraining orders, or orders expelling an allegedly abusive household member from the home of a nonabusive parent, guardian, or legal custodian, will allow the child to safely remain in the home;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether any orders for examinations, evaluations, or immediate services are needed. The court may not order a parent to undergo examinations, evaluation, or services at the shelter care hearing unless the parent agrees to the examination, evaluation, or service;</p>

<li>
<p>The court shall release a child alleged to be dependent to the care, custody, and control of the child's parent, guardian, or legal custodian unless the court finds there is reasonable cause to believe that:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>After consideration of the specific services that have been provided, reasonable efforts have been made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from the child's home and to make it possible for the child to return home; and</li>
</ol>
<p>ii.(A) The child has no parent, guardian, or legal custodian to provide supervision and care for such child; or</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(B) The release of such child would present a serious threat of substantial harm to such child, notwithstanding an order entered pursuant to RCW 26.44.063; or</p>
<p>(C) The parent, guardian, or custodian to whom the child could be released has been charged with violating RCW 9A.40.060 or 9A.40.070.</p>
<pre><code>b. If the court does not release the child to his or her parent, guardian, or legal custodian, the court shall order placement with a relative or other suitable person as described in RCW 13.34.130(1)(b), unless there is reasonable cause to believe the health, safety, or welfare of the child would be jeopardized or that the efforts to reunite the parent and child will be hindered. If such relative or other suitable person appears otherwise suitable and competent to provide care and treatment, the fingerprint-based background check need not be completed before placement, but as soon as possible after placement. The court must also determine whether placement with the relative or other suitable person is in the child's best interests. The relative or other suitable person must be willing and available to:

    i. Care for the child and be able to meet any special needs of the child;

    ii. Facilitate the child's visitation with siblings, if such visitation is part of the department's plan or is ordered by the court; and

    iii. Cooperate with the department in providing necessary background checks and home studies.

c. If the child was not initially placed with a relative or other suitable person, and the court does not release the child to his or her parent, guardian, or legal custodian, the department shall make reasonable efforts to locate a relative or other suitable person pursuant to RCW 13.34.060(1). In determining placement, the court shall weigh the child's length of stay and attachment to the current provider in determining what is in the best interest of the child.

d. If a relative or other suitable person is not available, the court shall order continued shelter care and shall set forth its reasons for the order. If the court orders placement of the child with a person not related to the child and not licensed to provide foster care, the placement is subject to all terms and conditions of this section that apply to relative placements.

e. Any placement with a relative, or other suitable person approved by the court pursuant to this section, shall be contingent upon cooperation with the department's or agency's case plan and compliance with court orders related to the care and supervision of the child including, but not limited to, court orders regarding parent-child contacts, sibling contacts, and any other conditions imposed by the court. Noncompliance with the case plan or court order is grounds for removal of the child from the home of the relative or other suitable person, subject to review by the court.

f. If the child is placed in a qualified residential treatment program as defined in this chapter, the court shall, within sixty days of placement, hold a hearing to:

    i. Consider the assessment required under RCW 13.34.420 and submitted as part of the department's social study, and any related documentation;

    ii. Determine whether placement in foster care can meet the child's needs or if placement in another available placement setting best meets the child's needs in the least restrictive environment; and

    iii. Approve or disapprove the child's placement in the qualified residential treatment program.

g. Uncertainty by a parent, guardian, legal custodian, relative, or other suitable person that the alleged abuser has in fact abused the child shall not, alone, be the basis upon which a child is removed from the care of a parent, guardian, or legal custodian under (a) of this subsection, nor shall it be a basis, alone, to preclude placement with a relative or other suitable person under (b) of this subsection.

<p>The status of all children found to be dependent shall be reviewed by the court at least every six months from the beginning date of the placement episode or the date dependency is established, whichever is first.

<p>A child shall not be returned home at the review hearing unless the court finds that a reason for removal as set forth in RCW 13.34.130 no longer exists. The parents, guardian, or legal custodian shall report to the court the efforts they have made to correct the conditions which led to removal. If a child is returned, casework supervision by the department shall continue for a period of six months, at which time there shall be a hearing on the need for continued intervention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to the child returning home, the department must complete the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Identify all adults residing in the home and conduct background checks on those persons;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify any persons who may act as a caregiver for the child in addition to the parent with whom the child is being placed and determine whether such persons are in need of any services in order to ensure the safety of the child, regardless of whether such persons are a party to the dependency. The department may recommend to the court and the court may order that placement of the child in the parent's home be contingent on or delayed based on the need for such persons to engage in or complete services to ensure the safety of the child prior to placement. If services are recommended for the caregiver, and the caregiver fails to engage in or follow through with the recommended services, the department must promptly notify the court; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notify the parent with whom the child is being placed that he or she has an ongoing duty to notify the department of all persons who reside in the home or who may act as a caregiver for the child both prior to the placement of the child in the home and subsequent to the placement of the child in the home as long as the court retains jurisdiction of the dependency proceeding or the department is providing or monitoring either remedial services to the parent or services to ensure the safety of the child to any caregivers.</p>

<p>Caregivers may be required to engage in services under this subsection solely for the purpose of ensuring the present and future safety of a child who is a ward of the court. This subsection does not grant party status to any individual not already a party to the dependency proceeding, create an entitlement to services or a duty on the part of the department to provide services, or create judicial authority to order the provision of services to any person other than for the express purposes of this section or RCW 13.34.025 or if the services are unavailable or unsuitable or the person is not eligible for such services.</p>
<pre><code>c. If the child is not returned home, the court shall establish in writing:

    i. Whether the department is making reasonable efforts to provide services to the family and eliminate the need for placement of the child. If additional services, including housing assistance, are needed to facilitate the return of the child to the child's parents, the court shall order that reasonable services be offered specifying such services;

    ii. Whether there has been compliance with the case plan by the child, the child's parents, and the agency supervising the placement;

    iii. Whether progress has been made toward correcting the problems that necessitated the child's placement in out-of-home care;

    iv. Whether the services set forth in the case plan and the responsibilities of the parties need to be clarified or modified due to the availability of additional information or changed circumstances;

v. Whether there is a continuing need for placement;

vi. Within sixty days of the placement of a child in a qualified residential treatment program as defined in this chapter, and at each review hearing thereafter if the child remains in such a program, the following:
</code></pre>
<p>(A) Whether ongoing assessment of the child's strengths and needs continues to support the determination that the child's needs cannot be met through placement in a foster family home;</p>
<p>(B) Whether the child's placement provides the most effective and appropriate level of care in the least restrictive environment;</p>
<p>(C) Whether the placement is consistent with the child's permanency plan;</p>
<p>(D) What specific treatment or service needs will be met in the placement, and how long the child is expected to need the treatment or services; and</p>
<p>(E) What efforts the department has made to prepare the child to return home or be placed with a fit and willing relative as defined in RCW 13.34.030, a Title 13 RCW legal guardian, an adoptive parent, or in a foster family home.</p>
<pre><code>vii. Whether a parent's **experiencing** homelessness or lack of suitable housing is a significant factor delaying permanency for the child by preventing the return of the child to the home of the child's parent and whether housing assistance should be provided by the department;

viii. Whether the child is in an appropriate placement which adequately meets all physical, emotional, and educational needs;

    ix. Whether preference has been given to placement with the child's relatives if such placement is in the child's best interests;

x. Whether both in-state and, where appropriate, out-of-state placements have been considered;

xi. Whether the parents have visited the child and any reasons why visitation has not occurred or has been infrequent;

xii. Whether terms of visitation need to be modified;

xiii. Whether the court-approved long-term permanent plan for the child remains the best plan for the child;

xiv. Whether any additional court orders need to be made to move the case toward permanency; and

xv. The projected date by which the child will be returned home or other permanent plan of care will be implemented.

d. The court at the review hearing may order that a petition seeking termination of the parent and child relationship be filed.
