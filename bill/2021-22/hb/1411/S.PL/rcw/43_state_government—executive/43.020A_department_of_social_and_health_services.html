<p>The department of social and health services is designed to integrate and coordinate all those activities involving provision of care for individuals who, as a result of their economic, social or health condition, require financial assistance, institutional care, rehabilitation or other social and health services.

The department will concern itself with changing social needs, and will expedite the development and implementation of programs designed to achieve its goals. In furtherance of this policy, it is the legislative intent to set forth only the broad outline of the structure of the department, leaving specific details of its internal organization and management to those charged with its administration.</p>

The department, a contracted provider, or a licensee, when conducting a character, competence, and suitability review for the purpose of hiring, licensing, certifying, contracting with, permitting, or continuing to permit a person to be employed in any position caring for or having unsupervised access to vulnerable adults or children, has a rebuttable presumption that its exercise of discretion under this section or the refusal to exercise such discretion was appropriate.

<p>Any program that provides domestic violence treatment to perpetrators of domestic violence must be certified by the department of social and health services and meet minimum standards for domestic violence treatment purposes. The department of social and health services shall adopt rules for standards of approval of domestic violence perpetrator programs. The treatment must meet the following minimum qualifications:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>All treatment must be based upon a full, complete clinical intake including but not limited to: Current and past violence history; a lethality risk assessment; history of treatment from past domestic violence perpetrator treatment programs; a complete diagnostic evaluation; a substance abuse assessment; criminal history; assessment of cultural issues, learning disabilities, literacy, and special language needs; and a treatment plan that adequately and appropriately addresses the treatment needs of the individual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To facilitate communication necessary for periodic safety checks and case monitoring, the program must require the perpetrator to sign the following releases:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A release for the program to inform the victim and victim's community and legal advocates that the perpetrator is in treatment with the program, and to provide information, for safety purposes, to the victim and victim's community and legal advocates;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A release to prior and current treatment agencies to provide information on the perpetrator to the program; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A release for the program to provide information on the perpetrator to relevant legal entities including: Lawyers, courts, parole, probation, child protective services, and child welfare services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treatment must be for a minimum treatment period defined by the secretary of the department of social and health services by rule. The weekly treatment sessions must be in a group unless there is a documented, clinical reason for another modality. Any other therapies, such as individual, marital, or family therapy, substance abuse evaluations or therapy, medication reviews, or psychiatric interviews, may be concomitant with the weekly group treatment sessions described in this section but not a substitute for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The treatment must focus primarily on ending the violence, holding the perpetrator accountable for his or her violence, and changing his or her behavior. The treatment must be based on nonvictim-blaming strategies and philosophies and shall include education about the individual, family, and cultural dynamics of domestic violence. If the perpetrator or the victim has a minor child, treatment must specifically include education regarding the effects of domestic violence on children, such as the emotional impacts of domestic violence on children and the long-term consequences that exposure to incidents of domestic violence may have on children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Satisfactory completion of treatment must be contingent upon the perpetrator meeting specific criteria, defined by rule by the secretary of the department of social and health services, and not just upon the end of a certain period of time or a certain number of sessions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The program must have policies and procedures for dealing with reoffenses and noncompliance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All evaluation and treatment services must be provided by, or under the supervision of, qualified personnel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The secretary of the department of social and health services may adopt rules and establish fees as necessary to implement this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of social and health services may conduct on-site monitoring visits as part of its plan for certifying domestic violence perpetrator programs and monitoring implementation of the rules adopted by the secretary of the department of social and health services to determine compliance with the minimum qualifications for domestic violence perpetrator programs. The applicant or certified domestic violence perpetrator program shall cooperate fully with the department of social and health services in the monitoring visit and provide all program and management records requested by the department of social and health services to determine the program's compliance with the minimum certification qualifications and rules adopted by the department of social and health services.</p>

<p>Where the department is required to screen a long-term care worker, contracted provider, or licensee through a background check to determine whether the person has a history that would disqualify the person from having unsupervised access to, working with, or providing supervision, care, or treatment to vulnerable adults or children, the department may not automatically disqualify a person on the basis of a criminal record that includes a conviction of any of the following crimes once the specified amount of time has passed for the particular crime:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Selling marijuana to a person under RCW 69.50.401 after three years or more have passed between the most recent conviction and the date the background check is processed;</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Robbery in the second degree under RCW 9A.56.210 after five years or more have passed between the most recent conviction and the date the background check is processed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extortion in the second degree under RCW 9A.56.130 after five years or more have passed between the most recent conviction and the date the background check is processed;</p>

<p>The provisions of subsection (1) of this section do not apply where the department is performing background checks for the department of children, youth, and families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provisions of subsection (1) of this section do not apply to department employees or applicants for department positions except for positions in the state-operated community residential program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a long-term care worker, contracted provider, or licensee may not provide, or be paid to provide, care to children or vulnerable adults under the medicare or medicaid programs if the worker is excluded from participating in those programs by federal law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department, a contracted provider, or a licensee, when conducting a character, competence, and suitability review for the purpose of hiring, licensing, certifying, contracting with, permitting, or continuing to permit a person to be employed in any position caring for or having unsupervised access to vulnerable adults or children, may, in its sole discretion, determine whether to consider any of the convictions identified in subsection (1) of this section. If the department or a consumer directed employer as defined in RCW 74.39A.009 determines that an individual with any of the convictions identified in subsection (1) of this section is qualified to provide services to a department client as an individual provider as defined in RCW 74.39A.240, the department or the consumer directed employer must provide the client, and their guardian if any, with the results of the state background check for their determination of character, suitability, and competence of the individual before the individual begins providing services. The department, a contracted provider, or a licensee, when conducting a character, competence, and suitability review for the purpose of hiring, licensing, certifying, contracting with, permitting, or continuing to permit a person to be employed in any position caring for or having unsupervised access to vulnerable adults or children, has a rebuttable presumption that its exercise of discretion under this section or the refusal to exercise such discretion was appropriate. This subsection does not create a duty for the department to conduct a character, competence, and suitability review.</p>
