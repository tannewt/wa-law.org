<li>Trees and other woody vegetation are a necessary and important part of community  environments. <strong>Urban and community</strong> forests have many values and uses including conserving energy, reducing air and water pollution and soil erosion, contributing to property values, attracting business, reducing glare and noise, providing aesthetic and historical values, providing wood products, and affording comfort and protection for humans and wildlife.</li>
</ol>
<p>2.</p>
<p><strong>As urban and community areas in Washington state grow, the need to plan for, promote, and manage urban and community forests increases. Cities and communities benefit from assistance in developing and maintaining urban and community forestry programs that also address future growth.</strong></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p><strong>Assistance and encouragement in the establishment, retention, and enhancement of these forests and trees by local governments, residents, organizations, and professionals are in the interest of the state based on the contributions these forests make in preserving and enhancing the quality of life of Washington's cities, counties, and tribal lands while providing opportunities for economic development.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Well-maintained urban forests deliver local air and water quality benefits that can have positive impacts on human health.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Increased tree canopy in urban areas can positively impact salmon populations through stormwater management and reduction of stream temperatures, thereby improving critical salmon habitat</strong>.</p>

<p>The department must ensure a minimum of 50 percent of the resources used in delivering the policies, programs, and activities of this chapter are benefiting vulnerable populations and are delivered in or within one-quarter mile of highly impacted communities as identified by the tools described in subsection (2)(b) of this section, and scale these resources so the most resources are allocated to the highest impacted communities within these areas. This includes resources for establishing and maintaining new trees as well as maintenance of existing tree canopy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall conduct a statewide inventory of urban and community forests using urban forest inventory and assessment protocols established by the United States forest service to produce statistically relevant estimates of the quantity, health, composition, and benefits of urban trees and forests. Inventory data must be maintained and periodically updated.</p>
