## **76.15.005 - Finding.**
1. Trees and other woody vegetation are a necessary and important part of community  environments. **Urban and community** forests have many values and uses including conserving energy, reducing air and water pollution and soil erosion, contributing to property values, attracting business, reducing glare and noise, providing aesthetic and historical values, providing wood products, and affording comfort and protection for humans and wildlife.

2.

**As urban and community areas in Washington state grow, the need to plan for, promote, and manage urban and community forests increases. Cities and communities benefit from assistance in developing and maintaining urban and community forestry programs that also address future growth.**

3. **Assistance and encouragement in the establishment, retention, and enhancement of these forests and trees by local governments, residents, organizations, and professionals are in the interest of the state based on the contributions these forests make in preserving and enhancing the quality of life of Washington's cities, counties, and tribal lands while providing opportunities for economic development.**

4. **Well-maintained urban forests deliver local air and water quality benefits that can have positive impacts on human health.**

5. **Increased tree canopy in urban areas can positively impact salmon populations through stormwater management and reduction of stream temperatures, thereby improving critical salmon habitat**.

## **76.15.007 - Purpose.**
The purpose of this chapter is to:

1. Encourage

**planning for, planting, maintaining, and managing of trees in the state's cities, counties, and tribal lands and maximize the potential of tree and vegetative cover in improving the quality of the environment;**
