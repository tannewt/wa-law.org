# House Bill 1315 - Session Law Chapter 043 Year 2021

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1315.SL.xml)
## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that domestic violence causes physical and psychological harm, broken families, economic loss, and other societal ills. According to the center for disease control's national intimate partner and sexual violence survey, about one in three women and one in three men reported experiencing intimate partner violence in their lifetime. In Washington in 2017, over 54,000 domestic violence offenses were reported to law enforcement and 49 domestic violence homicides were committed.

2. The legislature finds that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the severity of the domestic violence crisis and the urgency of addressing the crisis. Economic independence is highly correlated with preventing intimate partner violence, and the pandemic has decreased opportunities for economic independence across many groups. The increased gaps in childcare and social services under the pandemic, along with increased isolation with abusers, have exacerbated existing issues. Further, mandated closures and lockdowns have decreased opportunities for community reporting of signs of domestic abuse, such as by teachers or medical professionals, and increased the bureaucratic difficulties in reporting processes.

3. The legislature finds that the workplace may be the only location in which an individual experiencing domestic violence may be free from a perpetrator and feel safe. In either a physical or remote environment, individuals experiencing domestic violence may also find the workplace a place of shared confidences. Therefore, the legislature intends to create a task force to explore ways in which the employer and employee community may help curb domestic violence.

4. This section expires June 30, 2023.
