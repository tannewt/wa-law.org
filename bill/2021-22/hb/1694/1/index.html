<p>For purposes of the regulatory process established in this chapter, the department may consider any product identified in the department's final PFAS chemical action plan dated November 2021 as a source of or use of PFAS chemicals to be a priority consumer product under this chapter. No additional action, including publication in the Washington State Register, is required for the department to designate such a product as a priority consumer product for purposes of this chapter. The department may, under the process established in RCW 70A.350.040, determine regulatory actions and adopt rules to implement those regulatory determinations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Firefighting personal protective equipment, as defined in RCW 70A.400.005, is established as a priority consumer product for PFAS chemicals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the products identified in this section, the department is directed to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Determine an initial set of regulatory actions under this chapter by June 1, 2024; and</p>
</li>
