[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/House%20Bills/1694.xml)
## Section 1
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [70A.350](/rcw/70A_environmental_health_and_safety/70A.350_toxic_pollution.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/70A_environmental_health_and_safety/70A.350_toxic_pollution.md) for context.

1. For purposes of the regulatory process established in this chapter, the department may consider any product identified in the department's final PFAS chemical action plan dated November 2021 as a source of or use of PFAS chemicals to be a priority consumer product under this chapter. No additional action, including publication in the Washington State Register, is required for the department to designate such a product as a priority consumer product for purposes of this chapter. The department may, under the process established in RCW 70A.350.040, determine regulatory actions and adopt rules to implement those regulatory determinations.

2. Firefighting personal protective equipment, as defined in RCW 70A.400.005, is established as a priority consumer product for PFAS chemicals.

3. For the products identified in this section, the department is directed to:

    a. Determine an initial set of regulatory actions under this chapter by June 1, 2024; and

    b. Adopt rules to implement the initial set of determinations of regulatory actions under (a) of this subsection by December 1, 2025.

    d. The potential for priority chemicals to be found in the outdoor environment, with priority given to surface water, groundwater, marine waters, sediments, and other ecologically sensitive areas, when the consumer product is used, disposed of, or has decomposed;

    e. If another state or nation has identified or taken regulatory action to restrict or otherwise regulate the priority chemical in the consumer product;

    f. The availability and feasibility of safer alternatives; and

    g. Whether the department has already identified the consumer product in a chemical action plan completed under chapter 70A.300 RCW as a source of a priority chemical or other reports or information gathered under chapter 70A.430, 70A.405, 70A.222, 70A.335, 70A.340, 70A.230, or 70A.400 RCW.

    b. [Empty]

        i. The restriction will reduce a significant source of or use of a priority chemical; or

        ii. The restriction is necessary to protect the health of sensitive populations or sensitive species.

4. When determining regulatory actions under this section, the department may consider, in addition to the criteria pertaining to the selection of priority chemicals and priority consumer products that are specified in RCW 70A.350.020 and 70A.350.030, whether:

    a. The priority chemical or members of a class of priority chemicals are functionally necessary in the priority consumer product; and

    b. A restriction would be consistent with regulatory actions taken by another state or nation on a priority chemical or members of a class of priority chemicals in a product.

5. A restriction or prohibition on a priority chemical in a consumer product may include exemptions or exceptions, including exemptions to address existing stock of a product in commerce at the time that a restriction takes effect.
