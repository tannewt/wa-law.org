<blockquote>
<p>This section adds a new section to an existing chapter <a href="/rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.04_business_and_occupation_tax.html">82.04</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.04_business_and_occupation_tax.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Subject to the limitations in this section, a credit is allowed against the tax imposed under this chapter for contributions made by a person to the equitable access to credit program created in chapter 43.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 7 of this act).</p>
</li>
<li>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The person must make the contribution before claiming a credit authorized under this section. The credit may be used against any tax due under this chapter. The amount of the credit claimed for a reporting period may not exceed the tax otherwise due under this chapter for that reporting period. No person may claim more than $1,000,000 of credit in any calendar year, including credit carried over from a previous calendar year. No refunds may be granted for any unused credits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any amount of tax credit otherwise allowable under this section not claimed by the person in any calendar year may be carried forward and claimed against a person's tax liability for the next succeeding calendar year; and any credit not used in that next succeeding calendar year may be carried forward and claimed against the person's tax liability for the second succeeding calendar year, but may not be carried over for any calendar year thereafter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Credits are available on a first-in-time basis. The department must disallow any credits, or portions thereof, that would cause the total amount of credits claimed under this section for any calendar year to exceed $8,000,000. If this limitation is reached, the department must notify the department of commerce that the annual statewide limit has been met. In addition, the department must provide written notice to any person who has claimed tax credits in excess of the limitation in this subsection. The notice must indicate the amount of tax due and provide the tax be paid within 30 days from the date of the notice. The department may not assess penalties and interest as provided in chapter 82.32 RCW on the amount due in the initial notice if the amount due is paid by the due date specified in the notice, or any extension thereof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To claim a credit under this section, a person must electronically file with the department all returns, forms, and any other information required by the department, in an electronic format as provided or approved by the department. Any return, form, or information required to be filed in an electronic format under this section is not filed until received by the department in electronic format. As used in this subsection, &quot;returns&quot; has the same meaning as &quot;return&quot; in RCW 82.32.050.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No application is necessary for the tax credit. The person must keep records necessary for the department to verify eligibility under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The equitable access to credit program must provide to the department, upon request, such information as may be needed to verify eligibility for credit under this section, including information regarding contributions received by the program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maximum credit that may be earned for each calendar year under this section for a person is limited to the lesser of $1,000,000 or an amount equal to 100 percent of the contributions made by the person to the equitable access to credit program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No credit may be earned for contributions made on or after June 30, 2031. Credits may be claimed as provided in subsections (2) through (4) of this section.</p>
</li>

<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;equitable access to credit program&quot; means a program established within the department of commerce pursuant to section 3 of this act.</p>

<p>The equitable access to credit program account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. All receipts from contributions to the equitable access to credit program created by this chapter must be deposited in the account. Expenditures from the account may be used only for the award of grants to qualified lending institutions from the equitable access to credit program. Only the director of the department of commerce or the director's designee may authorize expenditures from the account.
