<p>The Washington state health insurance pool account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. All receipts from moneys specifically appropriated to the account must be deposited in the account. Expenditures from this account shall be used to cover deficits incurred by the Washington state health insurance pool under this chapter in excess of the threshold established in this section. To the extent funds are available in the account, funds shall be expended from the account to offset that portion of the deficit that would otherwise have to be recovered by imposing an assessment on members in excess of a threshold of seventy cents per insured person per month. The commissioner shall authorize expenditures from the account, to the extent that funds are available in the account, upon certification by the pool board that assessments will exceed the threshold level established in this section. The account is subject to the allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures.</p>
<p>Whether the assessment has reached the threshold of seventy cents per insured person per month shall be determined by dividing the total aggregate amount of assessment by the proportion of total assessed members. Thus, stop loss members shall be counted as one-tenth of a whole member in the denominator given that is the amount they are assessed proportionately relative to a fully insured medical member.</p>

<p>There is created a nonprofit entity to be known as the Washington state health insurance pool. All members in this state on or after May 18, 1987, shall be members of the pool. When authorized by federal law, all self-insured employers shall also be members of the pool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pursuant to chapter 34.05 RCW the commissioner shall, within ninety days after May 18, 1987, give notice to all members of the time and place for the initial organizational meetings of the pool. A board of directors shall be established, which shall be comprised of ten members. The governor shall select one member of the board from each list of three nominees submitted by statewide organizations representing each of the following: (a) Health care providers; (b) health insurance agents; (c) small employers; and (d) large employers. The governor shall select two members of the board from a list of nominees submitted by statewide organizations representing health care consumers. In making these selections, the governor may request additional names from the statewide organizations representing each of the persons to be selected if the governor chooses not to select a member from the list submitted. The remaining four members of the board shall be selected by election from among the members of the pool. The elected members shall, to the extent possible, include at least one representative of health care service contractors, one representative of health maintenance organizations, and one representative of commercial insurers which provides disability insurance. The members of the board shall elect a chair from the voting members of the board. The insurance commissioner shall be a nonvoting, ex officio member. When self-insured organizations other than the Washington state health care authority become eligible for participation in the pool, the membership of the board shall be increased to eleven and at least one member of the board shall represent the self-insurers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The original members of the board of directors shall be appointed for intervals of one to three years. Thereafter, all board members shall serve a term of three years. Board members shall receive no compensation, but shall be reimbursed for all travel expenses as provided in RCW 43.03.050 and 43.03.060.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board shall submit to the commissioner a plan of operation for the pool and any amendments thereto necessary or suitable to assure the fair, reasonable, and equitable administration of the pool. The commissioner shall, after notice and hearing pursuant to chapter 34.05 RCW, approve the plan of operation if it is determined to assure the fair, reasonable, and equitable administration of the pool and provides for the sharing of pool losses on an equitable, proportionate basis among the members of the pool. The plan of operation shall become effective upon approval in writing by the commissioner consistent with the date on which the coverage under this chapter must be made available. If the board fails to submit a plan of operation within one hundred eighty days after the appointment of the board or any time thereafter fails to submit acceptable amendments to the plan, the commissioner shall, within ninety days after notice and hearing pursuant to chapters 34.05 and 48.04 RCW, adopt such rules as are necessary or advisable to effectuate this chapter. The rules shall continue in force until modified by the commissioner or superseded by a plan submitted by the board and approved by the commissioner.</p>

<p>Each member's proportion of participation in the pool shall be determined annually by the board based on annual statements and other reports deemed necessary by the board and filed by the member with the commissioner; and shall be determined by multiplying the total cost of pool operation by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction equals that member's total number of resident insured persons, including spouse and dependents, covered under all health plans in the state by that member during the preceding calendar year. The denominator of the fraction equals the total number of resident insured persons, including spouses and dependents, covered under all health plans in the state by all pool members during the preceding calendar year.</p>

<li>
<p>The board may abate or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of a member if, in the opinion of the board, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the member to fulfill its contractual obligations. If an assessment against a member is abated or deferred in whole or in part, the amount by which such assessment is abated or deferred may be assessed against the other members in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in subsection (2) of this section. The member receiving such abatement or deferment shall remain liable to the pool for the deficiency.</p>

<li>
<p>Subject to the limitation imposed in subsection (2)(c) of this section, the pool administrator shall transfer the assessments for pool contributions for the operation of the health benefit exchange to the treasurer for deposit into the health benefit exchange account with the quarterly assessments for 2014 as specified in the state omnibus appropriations act. If assessments exceed actual losses and administrative expenses of the pool and pool contributions for deposit into the health benefit exchange account, the excess shall be held at interest and used by the board to offset future losses or to reduce pool premiums. As used in this subsection, &quot;future losses&quot; includes reserves for incurred but not reported claims.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The board shall review populations that may need ongoing access to coverage through the pool, with specific attention to those persons who may be excluded from or may receive inadequate coverage beginning January 1, 2014, such as persons with end-stage renal disease or HIV/AIDS, or persons not eligible for coverage in the exchange.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the review under subsection (1) of this section indicates a continued need for coverage through the pool after December 31, 2013, the board shall submit recommendations regarding any modifications to pool eligibility requirements for new and ongoing enrollment after December 31, 2013. The recommendations must address any needed modifications to the standard health questionnaire or other eligibility screening tool that could be used in a manner consistent with federal law to determine eligibility for enrollment in the pool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board shall complete an analysis of current pool assessment requirements in relation to assessments that will fund the reinsurance program and recommend changes to pool assessments or any credits against assessments that may be considered for the reinsurance program. The analysis shall recommend whether the categories of members paying assessments should be adjusted to make the assessment fair and equitable among all payers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board shall report its recommendations to the governor and the legislature by December 1, 2012.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board shall revisit the study of eligibility completed in 2012 with another review of the populations that may need ongoing access to coverage through the pool, to be submitted to the governor and legislature by November 1, 2015. The eligibility study shall include the nonmedicare populations scheduled to lose coverage and medicare populations, and consider whether the enrollees have access to comprehensive coverage alternatives that include appropriate pharmacy coverage. The study shall include recommendations to address any barriers in eligibility that remain in accessing other coverage such as medicare supplemental coverage or comprehensive pharmacy coverage, as well as suggestions for financing changes and recommendations on a future expiration of the pool.</p>
