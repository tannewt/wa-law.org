<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that ranchers, farmers, rural property owners, and others who live and work in the rural areas of our state that are most susceptible to the threat of wildfire are uniquely situated, by virtue of their knowledge of the land and proximity to wildfires, to provide critical initial attack firefighting capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rangeland fire protection associations have the potential to offer a coordinated approach to wildland fire suppression by taking advantage of the quick initial attack capabilities of those already out on the land, addressing the desire of those living and working in wildland areas to be active participants in protecting the places where they live and work, ensuring that all those engaged in the wildland firefighting effort have the necessary training, equipment, and communications capabilities, and supporting the state's efforts to provide a complete, coordinated approach to wildland fire prevention, detection, and suppression.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accordingly, it is the intent of the legislature that the department of natural resources implement a five-year pilot project in three locations in eastern Washington in order to assess the effectiveness of rangeland fire protection associations in Washington.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2-2264">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-2264">¶</a></h2>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A rangeland fire protection association operating as part of the pilot project authorized by this act may enter into agreements with fire protection service agencies for the detection, prevention, or suppression of fires. Subject to the approval of the department, the fire protection service agency may negotiate the form and content of the agreement, and may determine the safety, administrative, and training requirements that must be met in order for the rangeland fire protection association to enter into an agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall conduct the rangeland fire protection association pilot project in three separate areas east of the crest of the Cascade mountains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall submit a report on the pilot project to the appropriate committees of the legislature at the conclusion of the pilot project. The report is due by November 15, 2026. The report must address, at a minimum, the following elements:</p>
