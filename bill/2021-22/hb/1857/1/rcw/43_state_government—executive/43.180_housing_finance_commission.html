<p>It is declared to be the public policy of the state and a recognized governmental function to assist in making affordable and decent housing available throughout the state and by so doing to contribute to the general welfare. Decent housing for the people of our state is a most important public concern. Interest rates and construction costs have made it impossible for many Washington citizens to purchase their own homes. Older people, disabled persons, and low and moderate-income families often cannot afford to rent decent housing. There exists throughout the state a serious shortage of safe, sanitary and energy efficient housing available at prices within the financial means of our citizens. General economic development within the state is also impeded by a lack of affordable housing. The state's economy, which is dependent on the timber, wood products, and construction industries, has been damaged by inadequate investment in housing construction and rehabilitation. The result has been high unemployment and economic hardship affecting the prosperity of all the people of the state, particularly those in the wood products industry.</p>
<p>It is the purpose of this chapter to establish a state housing finance commission to act as a financial conduit which, without using public funds or lending the credit of the state or local government, can issue nonrecourse revenue bonds and participate in federal, state, and local housing programs and thereby make additional funds available at affordable rates to help provide housing throughout the state. It is also a primary purpose of this chapter to encourage the use of Washington state forest products in residential construction. This chapter is enacted to accomplish these and related purposes and shall be liberally construed to carry out its purposes and objectives.</p>

<li>
<p>The commission shall adopt written policies to provide for the selection of bond counsel. The policies shall provide for the creation and maintenance of a roster of attorneys whom the commission believes possess the requisite special expertise and professional standing to provide bond counsel opinions which would be accepted by the underwriters, bondholders, and other members of the financial community, and which would be in furtherance of the public interest in obtaining the lowest possible interest rates on the bonds issued by the commission. Any attorney may apply to have his or her name placed on the roster, but may not be placed on the roster unless the attorney demonstrates to the commission's satisfaction that the attorney would issue the kind of opinions required by this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to selecting an attorney or attorneys to provide bond counsel services, the commission shall provide all attorneys on the roster with a notice of its intentions to select bond counsel and shall invite each of them to submit to the commission his or her fee schedule for providing bond counsel services. The commission shall have wide discretion in selecting the attorney or attorneys it considers to be most appropriate to provide the services, but in the exercise of this discretion the commission shall consider all submitted fee schedules and the public interest in achieving both savings in bond counsel fees and issuance of bonds on terms most favorable to the commission. At least once every two calendar years, the commission shall select anew an attorney or attorneys to serve as bond counsel. However, the commission may retain an attorney for longer than two years when necessary to complete work on a particular bond issue. An attorney previously retained may be selected again but only after the commission has provided other attorneys on the roster with an opportunity to be selected and has made the fee schedule review required under this subsection. In addition to or as an alternative to retaining counsel for a period of time, the commission may appoint an attorney to serve as counsel in respect to only a particular bond issue.</p>

Any underwriter may apply to have its name placed on the roster, but may not be placed on the roster unless it demonstrates to the commission's satisfaction that it meets the requirements of this section.</p>

<p>Whenever the commission decides that it needs the services of an underwriter, it shall provide all underwriters on the roster with a notice of its intentions and shall invite each of them to submit to the commission an itemization of its fees and other charges for providing underwriting services on the issue. The itemization shall be by categories designed by the commission. The commission shall have wide discretion in selecting the underwriter it considers to be most appropriate to provide the services, but in the exercise of this discretion the commission shall consider the underwriter's fees and other charges and the public interest in achieving both savings in the total costs of underwriting services and issuance of bonds on terms most favorable to the commission.</p>

<p>The Washington works housing program is created to increase opportunities for nonprofit organizations and public agencies to purchase, acquire, build, and own real property to be used for affordable housing for low and moderate-income households. The Washington works housing program is intended to provide access to new funding mechanisms and build long-term community equity by increasing the stock of permanently affordable housing owned by nonprofit organizations and public agencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Washington works housing program is intended to provide these opportunities for public agencies and nonprofit organizations, including those materially participating as a managing member or general partner of a partnership, limited liability company, or equivalent organization, through the issuance of tax exempt or taxable revenue bonds issued by the commission in conjunction with a subsidy necessary to make bond issues to finance affordable housing properties financially feasible. The program is intended to provide financing for affordable housing that will meet the following income and rent restrictions during the period of initial bond indebtedness and thereafter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the period of initial bond indebtedness under the program, the owner of the property must meet one of the following requirements: A minimum of twenty percent of the units will be occupied by households earning less than fifty percent of area median income and an additional thirty-one percent of the units will be occupied by persons earning less than eighty percent of area median income; or forty percent of the units will be occupied by households earning less than sixty percent of area median income and an additional eleven percent of the units will be occupied by households earning less than eighty percent of area median income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the initial bond indebtedness is retired, the rents charged for units in the project will be adjusted to be sufficient to pay reasonable operation and maintenance expenses, including necessary capital needs, and to make reasonable deposits into a reserve account with the intent of providing affordable housing to very low or low-income households for the remaining useful life of the property. The reasonableness of the rent levels must be periodically approved by the commission based on information provided by the owner of the property about income, expenses, and necessary reserve levels. The determination of the commission regarding the reasonableness of the rent levels will be final.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission will enter into a recorded regulatory agreement with the borrower at the time of the issuance of bonds under the program for the purpose of ensuring that the property will meet the income and rent restrictions established in this section. The commission may charge such compliance fees as necessary to ensure enforcement of the income and rent restrictions during the useful life of the property.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>One billion dollars of the outstanding indebtedness of the commission is for the primary purpose of implementing the Washington works housing program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If no subsidies are available to make the program in subsection (2) of this section feasible, then the commission may pass a resolution stating these facts and authorize the use of a portion of the one billion dollars of indebtedness intended for the program to support its other bond programs until such time as the one billion dollars is exhausted or subsidies are available to make the program feasible.</p>
