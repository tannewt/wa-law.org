<p>The legislature finds that a balanced multimodal transportation system is required to maintain the state's commitment to the growing mobility needs of its citizens and commerce. The state's freight rail system, including branch lines, mainlines, rail corridors, terminals, yards, and equipment, is an important element of this multimodal system. Washington's economy relies heavily upon the freight rail system to ensure movement of the state's agricultural, chemical, and natural resources and manufactured products to local, national, and international markets and thereby contributes to the economic vitality of the state.</p>
<p>Since 1970, Washington has lost over one-third of its rail miles to abandonment and bankruptcies. The combination of rail abandonments and rail system capacity constraints may alter the delivery to market of many commodities. In addition, the resultant motor vehicle freight traffic increases the burden on state highways and county roads. In many cases, the cost of maintaining and upgrading the state highways and county roads exceeds the cost of maintaining rail freight service. Thus, the economy of the state will be best served by a policy of maintaining and encouraging a healthy rail freight system by creating mechanisms that keep rail freight lines operating if the benefits of the service outweigh the cost.</p>
<p>Recognizing the implications of this trend for freight mobility and the state's economic future, the legislature finds that better freight rail planning, better cooperation to preserve rail lines, and increased financial assistance from the state are necessary to maintain and improve the freight rail system within the state.</p>

<p>The Washington state department of transportation shall implement a state freight rail program that supports the freight rail service objectives identified in the state's multimodal transportation plan required under chapter 47.06 RCW. The support may be in the form of projects and strategies that support branch lines and light-density lines, provide access to ports, maintain adequate mainline capacity, and preserve or restore rail corridors and infrastructure.</p>

<p>The department of transportation shall prepare and periodically update a state rail plan, the objective of which is to identify, evaluate, and encourage essential rail services. The plan shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Identify and evaluate mainline capacity issues;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify and evaluate port-to-rail access and congestion issues;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Quantify the costs and benefits of maintaining rail service on those lines that are likely to be abandoned;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish priorities for determining which rail lines should receive state support. The priorities should include the anticipated benefits to the state and local economy, the anticipated cost of road and highway improvements necessitated by the abandonment or capacity constraints of the rail line, the likelihood the rail line receiving funding can meet operating costs from freight charges, surcharges on rail traffic, and other funds authorized to be raised by a county or port district, and the impact of abandonment or capacity constraints on changes in energy utilization and air pollution;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify and describe the state's rail system;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare a state freight rail system map;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Identify lines and corridors that have been rail banked or preserved; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify and evaluate other issues affecting the state's rail traffic.</p>

<p>The state, counties, local communities, ports, railroads, labor, and shippers all benefit from continuation of rail service and should participate in its preservation. Lines that provide benefits to the state and local jurisdictions, such as avoided roadway costs, reduced traffic congestion, economic development potential, environmental protection, and safety, should be assisted through the joint efforts of the state, local jurisdictions, and the private sector.</p>
<p>State funding for rail service, rail preservation, and corridor preservation projects must benefit the state's interests. The state's interest is served by reducing public roadway maintenance and repair costs, increasing economic development opportunities, increasing domestic and international trade, preserving jobs, and enhancing safety. State funding for projects is contingent upon appropriate local jurisdiction and private sector participation and cooperation. Before spending state moneys on projects, the department shall seek federal, local, and private funding and participation to the greatest extent possible.</p>

<li>
<p>The department of transportation shall continue to monitor the status of the state's mainline and branchline common carrier railroads and preserved rail corridors through the state rail plan and various analyses, and shall seek alternatives to abandonment prior to interstate commerce commission proceedings, where feasible.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that an actively coordinated and cooperatively facilitated railcar pool for transportation of perishable agricultural commodities is necessary for the continued viability and competitiveness of Washington's agricultural industry. The legislature also finds that the rail transportation model established by the Washington Grain Train program has been successful in serving the shipping needs of the wheat industry.</p>
<p>It is, therefore, the intent of the legislature to authorize and direct the Washington department of transportation to develop a railcar program for Washington's perishable commodity industries to be known as the Washington Produce Railcar Pool. This railcar program should be modeled from the Washington Grain Train program, but be made flexible enough to work with entities outside state government in order to fulfill its mission, including, but not limited to, the federal and local governments, commodity commissions, and private entities.</p>
