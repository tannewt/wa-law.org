<p>RCW 1.08.025 directs the code reviser, with the approval of the statute law committee, to prepare legislation for submission to the legislature &quot;concerning deficiencies, conflicts, or obsolete provisions&quot; in statutes. This act makes technical, nonsubstantive amendments as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Part 1 of this act merges multiple amendments created when sections were amended without reference to other amendments made in the same session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Part 2 of this act updates references in the code to the &quot;department of community, trade, and economic development&quot; with the &quot;department of commerce,&quot; in accordance with the renaming of that department by chapter 565, Laws of 2009.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Section 3001 of this act adds an expiration date to amendments to RCW 51.32.099. The underlying section expired June 30, 2016, but expiration dates for three amendatory sections were apparently omitted in error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Section 3002 of this act repeals an expiration date for 2011 amendments to RCW 74.60.020 and 74.60.090. The repealed expiration date conflicts with the expiration date provided in RCW 74.60.901.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Section 3003 of this act decodifies groups that are no longer active.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sections 3004 through 3007 of this act correct terminology relating to behavioral health disorders in certain sex offense statutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Section 3008 of this act updates a reference to a federal law which was reclassified and renumbered in 2017.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Section 3009 of this act changes the term &quot;apartment&quot; to &quot;lot&quot; in a section of chapter 64.38 RCW, relating to homeowners' associations.</p>

The ventilation shall be exhausted to the outside of the structure. The ventilation standards shall further provide for the capacity to supply outside air to each bedroom and the main living area through dedicated supply air inlet locations in walls, or in an equivalent manner.

<p>The interim requirements for all newly constructed residential buildings shall include standards for indoor air quality pollutant source control, including the following requirements: All structural panel components of the residence shall comply with appropriate standards for the emission of formaldehyde; the back-drafting of combustion by-products from combustion appliances shall be minimized through the use of dampers, vents, outside combustion air sources, or other appropriate technologies; and, in areas of the state where monitored data indicate action is necessary to inhibit indoor radon gas concentrations from exceeding appropriate health standards, entry of radon gas into homes shall be minimized through appropriate foundation construction measures.</p>

<p>No later than January 1, 1993, the state building code council, in consultation with the department of <strong>commerce</strong>, shall establish final requirements for the maintenance of indoor air quality in newly constructed residences to be in effect beginning July 1, 1993. For new electrically space heated residential buildings, these requirements shall maintain indoor air quality equivalent to that provided by the mechanical ventilation and indoor air pollutant source control requirements included in the February 7, 1989, Bonneville power administration record of decision for the environmental impact statement on new energy efficient homes programs (DOE/EIS-0127F) built with electric space heating. In residential units other than single-family, zero lot line, duplexes, and attached housing units in planned unit developments, ventilation requirements may be satisfied by the installation of two exhaust fans with a combined effective installed ventilation capacity of two hundred cubic feet per minute.

The public members shall be residents of the state appointed by the governor on the basis of their interest or expertise in trade, agriculture or business finance or jobs creation and development.

The governor shall designate the appointees who will serve the two-year and three-year terms.</p>
<p>In the event of a vacancy on the authority due to death, resignation or removal of one of the public members, or upon the expiration of the term of one of the public members, the governor shall appoint a successor for the remainder of the unexpired term. If either of the state offices is abolished, the resulting vacancy on the authority shall be filled by the state officer who shall succeed substantially to the power and duties of the abolished office.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The economic health and well-being of the state, particularly in areas of high unemployment, economic stagnation, and poverty, is of substantial public concern.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The consequences of minimal economic activity and persistent unemployment and underemployment are serious threats to the safety, health, and welfare of residents of these areas, decreasing the value of private investments and jeopardizing the sources of public revenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The economic and social interdependence of communities and the vitality of industrial and economic activity necessitates, and is in part dependent on preventing substantial dislocation of residents and rebuilding the diversification of the areas' economy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to remedy problems in stagnant areas of the state is beyond the power and control of the regulatory process and influence of the state, and the ordinary operations of private enterprise without additional governmental assistance are insufficient to adequately remedy the problems of poverty and unemployment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The revitalization of depressed communities requires the stimulation of private investment, the development of new business ventures, the provision of capital to ventures sponsored by local organizations and capable of growth in the business markets, and assistance to viable, but under-financed, small businesses in order to create and preserve jobs that are sustainable in the local economy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, the legislature declares there to be a substantial public purpose in providing capital to promote economic development and job creation in areas of economic stagnation, unemployment, and poverty. To accomplish this purpose, the legislature hereby creates the rural Washington loan fund and vests in the department of <strong>commerce</strong> the authority to spend federal funds to stimulate the economy of distressed areas.</p>

<p>Establish the following benchmarks using a statewide baseline of seventy-five billion vehicle miles traveled less the vehicle miles traveled attributable to vehicles licensed under RCW 46.16A.455 and weighing ten thousand pounds or more, which are exempt from this section:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>

</li>
</ol>
<ol type="i" start="6">

Utilities may continue to disconnect service for those practices authorized by law other than for nonpayment as provided for in this section. Customers who qualify for payment plans under this section who default on their payment plans and are disconnected can be reconnected and maintain the protections afforded under this chapter by paying reconnection charges, if any, and by paying all amounts that would have been due and owing under the terms of the applicable payment plan, absent default, on the date on which service is reconnected; and</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Notice in a tangible medium shall be provided as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>The consent of any lot owner is revoked if the association is unable to electronically transmit two consecutive notices and this inability becomes known to the secretary of the association of <strong>lot</strong> owners or any other person responsible for giving the notice. The inadvertent failure by the association of <strong>lot</strong> owners to treat this inability as a revocation does not invalidate any meeting or other action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notice to lot owners who have consented to receipt of electronically transmitted notices may be provided by posting the notice on an electronic network and delivering to the owner separate notice of the posting, together with comprehensible instructions regarding how to obtain access to the posting on the electronic network.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>This chapter modifies, limits, and supersedes the federal electronic signatures in global and national commerce act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 7001 et seq., but does not modify, limit, or supersede 15 U.S.C. Sec. 7001(c) or authorize electronic delivery of any of the notices described in 15 U.S.C. Sec. 7003(b).</p>
