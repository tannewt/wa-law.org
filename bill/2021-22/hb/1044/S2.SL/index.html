<p>Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the Washington state institute for public policy shall study enrollment, completion, and recidivism rates of incarcerated individuals in the postsecondary education system postrelease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The goal of the study is to understand whether participation in postsecondary education while incarcerated contributes to greater enrollment and completion of postsecondary education and reduced recidivism postrelease. The scope of the study shall focus on postrelease enrollment and completion trends in the community and technical college sector for formerly incarcerated individuals of all ages. The timeline of the study may include data from 2015 to the present, to the extent possible. The study's findings shall be divided into a preliminary and final report. The reports shall complement similar studies conducted at the University of Washington or elsewhere. To the extent that it is not duplicative of other studies, the Washington state institute for public policy shall study the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>For the preliminary report, which is due October 1, 2024:</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) Patterns and any effects on postrelease enrollment and participation in the community and technical college system by individuals who, while incarcerated, participated in postsecondary education programs, including those individuals that completed some coursework but did not earn a degree or certificate; and</p>
<p>(B) Differential outcomes for individuals participating in different types of postsecondary education courses, certificate programs, and degree programs.</p>
<pre><code>    ii. For the final report, which is due October 1, 2027, a continuation of the preliminary report in addition to:
</code></pre>
<p>(A) Changes in enrollment and completion of postsecondary education courses, certificate programs, and degree programs due to the changes and expansion of educational programming in this act, to the extent possible; and</p>
<p>(B) Recidivism outcomes beyond incarceration for those incarcerated individuals that participated in postsecondary certificate and degree programs while incarcerated, including arrests, charges, and convictions.</p>
<pre><code>    iii. The preliminary and final reports shall be submitted to the appropriate committees of the legislature and in accordance with RCW 43.01.036.

    iv. The department of corrections, the student achievement council, the state board for community and technical colleges, and the education research and data center shall provide data necessary to conduct the study.

<p>Recognizing that there is a positive correlation between education opportunities and reduced recidivism, it is the intent of the legislature to offer appropriate <strong>postsecondary</strong> degree <strong>or certificate</strong> opportunities to <strong>incarcerated individuals</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends that all <strong>incarcerated individuals</strong> be required to participate in department-approved education programs, work programs, or both, unless exempted as specifically provided in this section. Eligible <strong>incarcerated individuals</strong> who refuse to participate in available education or work programs available at no charge to the <strong>incarcerated individuals</strong> shall lose privileges according to the system established under RCW 72.09.130.

<p>Achievement of vocational skills necessary for purposes of work programs and for an <strong>incarcerated individual</strong> to qualify for work upon release;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional work and education programs necessary for compliance with an <strong>incarcerated individual's</strong> individual reentry plan under RCW 72.09.270**, including special education services and postsecondary degree or certificate education programs**; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other appropriate vocational, work, or education programs that are not necessary for compliance with an <strong>incarcerated individual's</strong> individual reentry plan under RCW 72.09.270 including <strong>postsecondary</strong> degree <strong>or certificate</strong> education programs.</p>

<p>If programming is provided pursuant to (a)(iv) of this subsection, <strong>incarcerated individuals</strong> shall be required to pay all or a portion of the costs, including books, fees, and tuition, for participation in any vocational, work, or education program as provided in department policies. Department policies shall include a formula for determining how much an <strong>incarcerated individual</strong> shall be required to pay. The formula shall include steps which correlate to an <strong>incarcerated individual's</strong> average monthly income or average available balance in a personal  savings account and which are correlated to a prorated portion or percent of the per credit fee for tuition, books, or other ancillary <strong>educational</strong> costs. The formula shall be reviewed every two years. A third party**, including but not limited to nonprofit entities or community-based postsecondary education programs,** may pay directly to the department all or a portion of costs and tuition for any programming provided pursuant to (a)(iv) of this subsection on behalf of an <strong>incarcerated individual</strong>.

<p>The department shall provide access to a program of education to all <strong>incarcerated individuals</strong> who are under the age of eighteen and who have not met high school graduation requirements or requirements to earn a high school equivalency certificate as provided in RCW 28B.50.536 in accordance with chapter 28A.193 RCW. The program of education established by the department and education provider under RCW 28A.193.020 for <strong>incarcerated individuals</strong> under the age of eighteen must provide each <strong>incarcerated individual</strong> a choice of curriculum that will assist the <strong>incarcerated individual</strong> in achieving a high school diploma or high school equivalency certificate. The program of education may include but not be limited to basic education, prevocational training, work ethic skills, conflict resolution counseling, substance abuse intervention, and anger management counseling.

<p>In addition to the policies set forth in this section, the department shall consider the following factors in establishing criteria for assessing the inclusion of education and work programs in an <strong>incarcerated individual's</strong> individual reentry plan and in placing <strong>incarcerated individuals</strong> in education and work programs:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>An <strong>incarcerated individual's</strong> release date and custody level. An <strong>incarcerated individual</strong> shall not be precluded from participating in an education or work program solely on the basis of his or her release date, except that <strong>incarcerated individuals</strong> with a release date of more than one hundred twenty months in the future shall not comprise more than ten percent of <strong>incarcerated individuals</strong> participating in a new class I correctional industry not in existence on June 10, 2004;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An <strong>incarcerated individual's</strong> education history and basic academic skills;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An <strong>incarcerated individual's</strong> work history and vocational or work skills;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An <strong>incarcerated individual's</strong> economic circumstances, including but not limited to an <strong>incarcerated individual's</strong> family support obligations; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where applicable, an <strong>incarcerated individual's</strong> prior performance in department-approved education or work programs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall establish, and periodically review, <strong>incarcerated individual</strong> behavior standards and program <strong>outcomes</strong> for all education and work programs. <strong>Incarcerated individuals</strong> shall be notified of applicable behavior standards and program goals prior to placement in an education or work program and shall be removed from the education or work program if they consistently fail to meet the standards or <strong>outcomes</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eligible <strong>incarcerated individuals</strong> who refuse to participate in available education or work programs available at no charge to the <strong>incarcerated individuals</strong> shall lose privileges according to the system established under RCW 72.09.130. Eligible <strong>incarcerated individuals</strong> who are required to contribute financially to an education or work program and refuse to contribute shall be placed in another work program. Refusal to contribute shall not result in a loss of privileges.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>The department shall establish, by rule, a process for identifying and assessing incarcerated individuals with learning disabilities, traumatic brain injuries, and other cognitive impairments to determine whether the person requires accommodations in order to effectively participate in educational programming, including general educational development tests and postsecondary education. The department shall establish a process to provide such accommodations to eligible incarcerated individuals.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The department shall establish, and periodically review, goals for expanding access to postsecondary degree and certificate education programs and program completion for all incarcerated individuals, including persons of color. The department may contract and partner with any accredited educational program sponsored by a nonprofit entity, community-based postsecondary education program, or institution with historical evidence of providing education programs to people of color.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall establish, by rule, objective medical standards to determine when an <strong>incarcerated individual</strong> is physically or mentally unable to participate in available education or work programs. When the department determines an <strong>incarcerated individual</strong> is permanently unable to participate in any available education or work program due to a health condition, the <strong>incarcerated individual</strong> is exempt from the requirement under subsection (2) of this section. When the department determines an <strong>incarcerated individual</strong> is temporarily unable to participate in an education or work program due to a medical condition, the <strong>incarcerated individual</strong> is exempt from the requirement of subsection (2) of this section for the period of time he or she is temporarily disabled. The department shall periodically review the medical condition of all <strong>incarcerated individuals</strong> with temporary disabilities to ensure the earliest possible entry or reentry by <strong>incarcerated individuals</strong> into available programming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall establish policies requiring an <strong>incarcerated individual</strong> to pay all or a portion of the costs and tuition for any vocational training or postsecondary education program if the <strong>incarcerated individual</strong> previously abandoned coursework related to <strong>postsecondary</strong> degree <strong>or certificate</strong> education or vocational training without excuse as defined in rule by the department. Department policies shall include a formula for determining how much an <strong>incarcerated individual</strong> shall be required to pay. The formula shall include steps which correlate to an <strong>incarcerated individual's</strong> average monthly income or average available balance in a personal  savings account and which are correlated to a prorated portion or percent of the per credit fee for tuition, books, or other ancillary costs. The formula shall be reviewed every two years. A third party may pay directly to the department all or a portion of costs and tuition for any program on behalf of an <strong>incarcerated individual</strong> under this subsection. Such payments shall not be subject to any of the deductions as provided in this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, an <strong>incarcerated individual</strong> sentenced to death under chapter 10.95 RCW or subject to the provisions of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1227:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>May not participate in <strong>a postsecondary</strong> degree education program offered by the department or its contracted providers**, unless the incarcerated individual's participation in the program is paid for by a third party or by the individual**;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May participate in prevocational or vocational training that may be necessary to participate in a work program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shall be subject to the applicable provisions of this chapter relating to <strong>incarcerated individual</strong> financial responsibility for programming.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p><strong>If an incarcerated individual has participated in postsecondary education programs, the department shall provide the incarcerated individual with a copy of the incarcerated individual's unofficial transcripts, at no cost to the individual, upon the incarcerated individual's release or transfer to a different facility. Upon the incarcerated individual's completion of a postsecondary education program, the department shall provide to the incarcerated individual, at no cost to the individual, a copy of the incarcerated individual's unofficial transcripts. This requirement applies regardless of whether the incarcerated individual became ineligible to participate in or abandoned a postsecondary education program.</strong></p>
