# House Bill 1264

## Section 1
The legislature finds that the health, safety, and productivity of all Washington communities, including historically marginalized communities, is of the utmost importance. All Washingtonians are harmed by unintended disparities created by legislation. Therefore, the legislature intends to create a tool to provide legislators with aggregated and disaggregated demographical data and other information to help legislators proactively identify possible disparate impacts on historically marginalized communities, and thus make better informed and intentional decisions on legislative proposals. The legislature also intends for the office of equity to provide agency training on completing an equity impact statement, in order to support the important work that the office of financial management is tasked with under this act, and to provide legislators with an effective tool to aid in their decision making.
The legislature finds that health impact reviews provide valuable information that helps legislators make informed decisions. However, given the nature of health impact reviews, the time required to complete a health impact review can be lengthy. As a result, it is a challenge to complete health impact reviews on all proposed legislation where objective, nonpartisan, data-driven information about the equity impacts of the proposed legislation would be useful in the legislative decision-making process. It is not the intent of the legislature to replace health impact reviews, but rather it is the intent of the legislature to establish a tool that can be applied to a greater number of legislative proposals, thereby enabling legislators to assess the equity impacts for a large number of measures. If further information about the equity impacts of proposed legislation is warranted, requesting a health impact review would be one possible path forward.
