<li>
<p>Any city or county planning under RCW 36.70A.040 must enact affordable housing programs providing for the development of low and moderate-income housing units, as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>All residential zoning within:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>One-quarter mile of light rail or a major transit hub must require a minimum base height of nine stories;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One-half mile of light rail or a major transit hub must require a minimum base height of six stories; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One mile of light rail or a major transit hub must require an average minimum base height of five stories.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>No density limits may be imposed within one mile of a light rail or major transit hub, but bulk and height regulations shall be permitted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All zoning within one-quarter mile of light rail or a major transit hub may allow for zero parking minimums and may not exceed parking maximums as calculated by the King county right size parking calculator.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buildings within a development project that commits to a minimum of 20 percent affordable units for low and moderate-income households shall be permitted one additional floor beyond the zoning code regulation for that area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this act, &quot;major transit hub&quot; means:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A stop on a high capacity transportation system funded or expanded under the provisions of chapter 81.104 RCW;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commuter rail stops;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stops on rail or fixed guideway systems, including transitways;</p>

<p>Any city or county planning under RCW 36.70A.040 must enact sustainable housing programs providing for the development for new, certified sustainable housing as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For areas within one mile of light rail or a major transit hub, cities shall complete a one-time, planned designation which may be updated every five years at the individual city's option to ensure that transportation planning aligns with increased density.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standards set by local design review boards must allow for buildings constructed with passive house, LEED, or living building challenge certifications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cities must create a preferred permit path program. Development projects may apply to the program if 20 percent or more of the housing units produced will be affordable for low or very low-income households, as defined under this chapter, or if they are passive house or living building challenge certified. Development projects accepted to the preferred permit path program must receive an expedited permit processing timeline that may not exceed 120 days. The jurisdiction may establish their own accountability system for determining whether a project will offer affordable housing.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>All new development requirements added to city zoning codes and any change of interpretation of those codes and other requirements shall be analyzed by the jurisdiction for their impact on the cost of housing construction. Each analysis shall include options for cost reductions, cost mitigation, and the minimum increase of costs.</p>

<p>Nothing in this section limits jurisdictions from implementing new rules that increase the cost of new sustainable, equitable, and affordable housing, but rather clarifies what those estimated costs and options to reduce the impact of those increased costs will be.</p>
