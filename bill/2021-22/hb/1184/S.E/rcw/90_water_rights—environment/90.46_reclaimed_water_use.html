<p>The legislature finds that by encouraging the use of reclaimed water while assuring the health and safety of all Washington citizens and the protection of its environment, the state of Washington will continue to use water in the best interests of present and future generations.</p>
<p>To facilitate the immediate use of reclaimed water for uses approved by the departments of ecology and health, the state shall expand both direct financial support and financial incentives for capital investments in water reuse and reclaimed water to effectuate the goals of this chapter. The legislature further directs the department of health and the department of ecology to coordinate efforts towards developing an efficient and streamlined process for creating and implementing processes for the use of reclaimed water.</p>
<p>It is hereby declared that the people of the state of Washington have a primary interest in the development of facilities to provide reclaimed water to replace potable water in nonpotable applications, to supplement existing surface and ground water supplies, and to assist in meeting the future water requirements of the state.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds and declares that the utilization of reclaimed water by local communities for domestic, agricultural, industrial, recreational, and fish and wildlife habitat creation and enhancement purposes, including wetland enhancement, will contribute to the peace, health, safety, and welfare of the people of the state of Washington. To the extent reclaimed water is appropriate for beneficial uses, it should be so used to preserve potable water for drinking purposes, contribute to the restoration and protection of instream flows that are crucial to preservation of the state's salmonid fishery resources, contribute to the restoration of Puget Sound by reducing wastewater discharge, provide a drought resistant source of water supply for nonpotable needs, or be a source of supply integrated into state, regional, and local strategies to respond to population growth and global warming. Use of reclaimed water constitutes the development of new basic water supplies needed for future generations and local and regional water management planning should consider coordination of infrastructure, development, storage, water reclamation and reuse, and source exchange as strategies to meet water demands associated with population growth and impacts of global warming.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds and declares that the use of reclaimed water is not inconsistent with the policy of antidegradation of state waters announced in other state statutes, including the water pollution control act, chapter 90.48 RCW and the water resources act, chapter 90.54 RCW.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that other states, including California, Florida, and Arizona, have successfully used reclaimed water to supplement existing water supplies without threatening existing resources or public health.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that the department of ecology and the department of health undertake the necessary steps to encourage the development of water reclamation facilities so that reclaimed water may be made available to help meet the growing water requirements of the state.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds and declares that reclaimed water facilities are water pollution control facilities as defined in chapter 70A.135 RCW and are eligible for financial assistance as provided in chapter 70A.135 RCW. The legislature finds that funding demonstration projects will ensure the future use of reclaimed water. The demonstration projects in RCW 90.46.110 are varied in nature and will provide the experience necessary to test different facets of the standards and refine a variety of technologies so that water purveyors can begin to use reclaimed water technology in a more cost-effective manner. This is especially critical in smaller cities and communities where the feasibility for such projects is great, but there are scarce resources to develop the necessary facilities.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that the agricultural processing industry can play a critical and beneficial role in promoting the efficient use of water by having the opportunity to develop and reuse agricultural industrial process water from food processing.</p>

<li>
<p>Unless the department of ecology adopts rules pursuant to RCW 90.46.015 that relate to the industrial and commercial use of reclaimed water specifying otherwise, the department of health may issue a reclaimed water permit for industrial and commercial uses of reclaimed water to the generator of reclaimed water who may then distribute the water, subject to provisions in the permit governing the location, rate, water quality, and purposes of use. Permits issued after the adoption of rules under RCW 90.46.015 must be consistent with the adopted rules.</p>

<p>The department of health in consultation with the advisory committee established in RCW 90.46.050, shall develop recommendations for a fee structure for permits issued under subsection (2) of this section. Fees shall be established in amounts to fully recover, and not exceed, expenses incurred by the department of health in processing permit applications and modifications, monitoring and evaluating compliance with permits, and conducting inspections and supporting the reasonable overhead expenses that are directly related to these activities. Permit fees may not be used for research or enforcement activities. The department of health shall not issue permits under this section until a fee structure has been established.</p>
