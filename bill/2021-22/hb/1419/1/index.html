<p>The legislature intends to prioritize serving students through a more just and racially equitable education system that prioritizes the whole child. Key to this effort is attracting, recruiting, preparing, and retaining a diverse, skilled, responsive, and reflective educator workforce. Washington state and school districts will strive to hire an educator workforce that reflects the diversity of the students they teach and will establish systems to retain their educator workforce as critical teaching skills and practices are cultivated and developed over time. A fair and equitable salary allocation to districts is foundational to this work.</p>
<p>This act develops a salary allocation model that more closely matches the salaries of the teachers who are hired by school districts. To accomplish this, each district will continue to annually report the experience and education of their teaching staff. State funding will be allocated accordingly to keep up with the increasing costs of a stable teaching force as they gain experience or attain additional education or degrees across their career and avoid creating disincentives that prevent districts from hiring the best teacher, while simultaneously meeting state expectations for class size.</p>

<p>Beginning with the 2023 regular legislative session, and every four years thereafter, the legislature shall review and rebase state basic education compensation allocations compared to school district compensation data, regionalization factors, what inflationary measure is the most representative of actual market experience for school districts, and other economic information. The legislature shall revise the minimum allocations, regionalization factors, and inflationary measure if necessary to ensure that state basic education allocations continue to provide market-rate salaries and that regionalization adjustments reflect actual economic differences between school districts.</p>
