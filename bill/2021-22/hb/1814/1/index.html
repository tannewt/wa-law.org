<p>The legislature finds and declares that stimulating local investment in community solar projects continues to be an important part of a state energy strategy by helping to increase energy independence from fossil fuels, promote economic development, hedge against the effects of climate change, and attain environmental benefits. The legislature finds that although previous community solar programs were successful in stimulating these benefits, the programs failed to provide an adequate framework for low-income participation and long-term market certainty. The legislature finds that the vast majority of Washingtonians still do not have access to the benefits of solar energy. The legislature intends to stimulate the deployment of community solar projects for the benefit of all Washingtonians by funding the renewable energy production incentive program for community solar projects and by creating opportunities for broader participation, especially by low-income households and low-income service providers. As of December 2021, the state is 10.3 megawatts short of the 115 megawatts of solar photovoltaic capacity established as a goal under RCW 82.16.155. The legislature therefore intends to provide an incentive sufficient to promote installation of community solar projects through June 30, 2033, at which point the legislature expects to review the effectiveness of enhancing access to community solar projects.</p>

<li>
<p>Beginning July 1, 2022, through June 30, 2033, an administrator of a community solar project meeting the eligibility requirements described in this section and RCW 82.16.170(3) may submit an application to the Washington State University extension energy program to receive a precertification for a community solar project. Projects with precertification applications approved by the Washington State University extension energy program have two years to complete their projects and apply for certification. Projects that have not completed certification within two years may apply to the Washington State University extension energy program for an extension of their precertification status for an additional 180 days if they can demonstrate significant progress during the time they were in precertification status. By certifying qualified projects pursuant to the requirements of this section and RCW 82.16.170(3), the Washington State University extension energy program authorizes the utility serving the site of a community solar project in the state of Washington to remit a one-time low-income community solar incentive payment to the community solar project administrator, who accepts the payment on behalf of, and for the purpose of providing direct benefits to, the project's qualifying subscribers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A one-time low-income community solar incentive payment remitted to a community solar project administrator for a project certified under this section equals the sum of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>An amount, not to exceed $20,000 per community solar project, equal to the community solar project's administrative costs related to the administrative start-up of the project for qualifying subscribers; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An amount that does not exceed 100 percent of the proportional cost of the installed cost of the share of the community solar project that provides direct benefits to qualifying subscribers, taking into account any federal tax credits or other federal or nonfederal grants or incentives that the program is benefiting from.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>No new certification may be issued under this section for a community solar project that was certified under RCW 82.16.120 or 82.16.165, or for a community solar project served by a utility that has elected not to participate in the incentive program provided in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community solar projects that are under precertification status under RCW 82.16.165 as of June 30, 2020, may not apply for precertification of that same project for the one-time low-income community solar incentive payment provided in this section.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>In addition to the one-time low-income community solar incentive payment under subsection (2) of this section, a participating utility must also provide the following compensation for the generation of electricity from the certified project:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>For a community solar project that has an alternating current nameplate capacity greater than 12 kilowatts but no greater than 100 kilowatts, and that is connected behind the electric service meter, compensation must be determined in accordance with RCW 80.60.020 and provided to the metered customer receiving service at the situs of the meter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For all other community solar projects, compensation must be determined at a value set by the participating utility and paid to the administrator or subscribers according to the agreement between the project and the utility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An administrator may deduct ongoing administrative costs from compensation provided from power generation, provided those costs are identified in the subscription agreement or justified to the Washington State University extension energy program. The Washington State University extension energy program shall review any such administrative costs justifications for reasonableness and approve, reject, or negotiate changes to the proposal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the utility provides compensation for the generation of electricity to the administrator, the administrator of a community solar project must provide that compensation to the project subscribers. For 10 years after certification, and by March 1st of each year following certification, the provider of compensation for the generation of electricity to the subscriber, whether the utility or the administrator, but not both, must provide the Washington State University extension energy program with signed statements of the following for the preceding year:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The energy production for the period for which compensation is to be provided;</p>

<li>
<p>The purpose of community solar programs is to facilitate broad, equitable community investment in and access to solar power. Beginning July 1, 2017, a community solar administrator may organize and administer a community solar project as provided in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In order to receive certification for the incentive payment provided under RCW 82.16.165(1) by June 30, 2022, a</strong> community solar project must have a direct current nameplate capacity that is no more than one thousand kilowatts and must have at least ten participants or <strong>at least</strong> one participant for every ten kilowatts of direct current nameplate capacity, whichever is greater. A community solar project that has a direct current nameplate capacity greater than five hundred kilowatts must be subject to a standard interconnection agreement with the utility serving the situs of the community solar project. Except for community solar projects authorized under subsection (10) of this section, each participant must be a customer of the utility providing service at the situs of the community solar project.</p>
</li>
<li>

<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.16_public_utility_tax.html">82.16.155</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.16_public_utility_tax.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preference and incentives created under  section<strong>s 4 and</strong> 6, chapter 36, Laws of 2017 3rd sp. sess. This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference and incentives. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature categorizes the tax preference created under <strong>section 4, chapter 36, Laws of 2017 3rd sp. sess.</strong> and incentive payments authorized in section 6, chapter 36, Laws of 2017 3rd sp. sess. as intended to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Induce participating utilities to make incentive payments to utility customers who invest in renewable energy systems; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By inducing utilities, nonprofit organizations, and utility customers to acquire and install renewable energy systems, retain jobs in the clean energy sector and create additional jobs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature's public policy objectives are to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Increase energy independence from fossil fuels; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote economic development through increasing and improving investment in, development of, and use of clean energy technology in Washington; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase the number of jobs in and enhance the sustainability of the clean energy technology industry in Washington.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the legislature's intent to provide the incentives in section<strong>s 4 and</strong> 6, chapter 36, Laws of 2017 3rd sp. sess.  in order to ensure the sustainable job growth and vitality of the state's renewable energy sector. The purpose of the incentive is to reduce the costs associated with installing and operating solar energy systems by persons or entities receiving the incentive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As part of its <strong>2023</strong> tax preference reviews, the joint legislative audit and review committee must review the tax preferences and incentives in section<strong>s 4 and</strong> 6, chapter 36, Laws of 2017 3rd sp. sess.  The legislature intends for the legislative auditor to determine that the incentive has achieved its desired outcomes if the following objectives are achieved:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Installation of one hundred fifteen megawatts of solar photovoltaic capacity by participants in the incentive program between July 1, 2017, and June 30, 2021; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Growth of solar-related employment from 2015 levels, as evidenced by:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>An increased per capita rate of solar energy-related jobs in Washington, which may be determined by consulting a relevant trade association in the state; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Achievement of an improved national ranking for solar energy‑related employment and per capita solar energy-related employment, as reported in a nationally recognized report.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review, the joint legislative audit and review committee may refer to data collected by the Washington State University extension energy program and may obtain employment data from the employment security department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Washington State University extension energy program must collect, through the application process, data from persons claiming the tax credit under <strong>section 4, chapter 36, Laws of 2017 3rd sp. sess.</strong> and persons receiving the incentive payments created in <strong>section 6, chapter 36, Laws of 2017 3rd sp. sess.</strong>, as necessary, and may collect data from other interested persons as necessary to report on the performance of chapter 36, Laws of 2017 3rd sp. sess.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All recipients of tax credits or incentive payments awarded under this chapter must provide data necessary to evaluate the tax preference performance objectives in this section as requested by the Washington State University extension energy program or the joint legislative audit and review committee. Failure to comply may result in the loss of a tax credit award or incentive payment in the following year.</p>
