</li>
<li>
<p>A licensed insurance producer who is unable to comply with license renewal procedures due to military service or some other extenuating circumstance such as a long-term medical disability, may request a waiver of those procedures.

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An individual, as part of the request for licensure, must furnish information concerning the individual's identity for submission to the Washington state patrol, the federal bureau of investigation, and any governmental agency or entity authorized to receive this information for a state and national criminal history background check. If, in the process of verifying business records or other information, the commissioner's office incurs fees or charges from another governmental agency or from a business firm, the amount of the fees or charges must be paid to the commissioner's office by the applicant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A nonresident business entity acting as a title insurance agent is required to obtain a title insurance agent license. Application must be made to the commissioner on the uniform business entity application, and the individual submitting the application must declare under penalty of refusal, suspension, or revocation of the license that the statements made in the application are true, correct, and complete to the best of the individual's knowledge and belief. Before approving the application, the commissioner must find that the business entity:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Has paid the fees set forth in RCW 48.14.010;</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>A nonresident insurance producer's satisfaction of the nonresident insurance producer's home state's continuing education requirements for licensed insurance producers constitutes satisfaction of this state's continuing education requirements if the nonresident producer's home state recognizes the satisfaction of its continuing education requirements imposed upon producers from this state on the same basis.</p>

<li>
<p>The commissioner may verify the nonresident insurance producer's licensing status through the producer database maintained by the NAIC, its affiliates, or subsidiaries.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Each licensed nonresident insurance producer or title insurance agent, by application for and issuance of a license, is deemed to have appointed the commissioner as the insurance producer's or title insurance agent's attorney to receive service of legal process issued against the insurance producer or title insurance agent in this state upon causes of action arising within this state. Service upon the commissioner as attorney constitutes effective legal service upon the insurance producer or title insurance agent.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The appointment of the commissioner as attorney is irrevocable, binds any successor in interest or to the assets or liabilities of the insurance producer or title insurance agent, and remains in effect for as long as there could be any cause of action against the insurance producer or title insurance agent arising out of the insurance producer's or title insurance agent's insurance transactions in this state.</p>
