<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the COVID-19 pandemic is causing sustained economic downturn throughout Washington state with unprecedented numbers of layoffs and reduced work hours forcing many residents to suffer economic hardship while being ordered to remain in their residences for extended periods of time. The inability to pay basic household expenses, including rent is restricting housing providers' ability to maintain the costs of operating residences and damaging property owners' ability to secure financing, threatening the future viability of rental housing opportunities across Washington state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that it is the long-standing practice of the state to make rental assistance available in many such urgent situations, and it is the intent of the legislature to create programs to address rental housing debt and provide payments for tenants to make rental payments to housing providers so that residents are able to remain as rental units to allow tenants to remain in their homes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington state has underproduced housing by approximately 225,600 units, from 2000 to 2015, which is approximately 7.5 percent of the total 2015 housing stock, with populous regions creating only one new unit of housing for every three new jobs created. Due to the devastating effects of a lack of rental payments available to housing providers, the legislature resolves that it is imperative the state preserve rental housing units as a critical component of the affordable housing portfolio of the state.</p>

<p>My income is less than 130 percent of the area median income for the county where I reside.

<p>If evicted I would likely become homeless, need to move into a homeless shelter, or need to move into a new residence shared by other people who live in close quarters because I have no other available housing options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I understand that I must still pay rent or make a housing payment, and comply with other obligations that I may have under my tenancy, lease agreement, or similar contract. I further understand that fees, penalties, or interest for not paying rent or making a housing payment on time as required by my tenancy, lease agreement, or similar contract may still be charged or collected on rent due after June 30, 2021.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I further understand that failure to provide this notice to my housing provider may require payment in full for all payments not made from February 29, 2020, to present and may make me subject to eviction pursuant to state and local laws.</p>
