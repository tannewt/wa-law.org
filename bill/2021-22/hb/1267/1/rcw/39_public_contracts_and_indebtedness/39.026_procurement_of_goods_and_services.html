<p>It is the intent of this chapter to promote open competition and transparency for all contracts for goods and services entered into by state agencies, unless specifically exempted under this chapter. It is further the intent of this chapter to centralize within one agency the authority and responsibility for the development and oversight of policies related to state procurement and contracting. To ensure the highest ethical standards, proper accounting for contract expenditures, and for ease of public review, it is further the intent to centralize the location of information about state procurements and contracts. It is also the intent of the legislature to provide state agency contract data to the public in a searchable manner.</p>
<p>In addition, the legislature intends that the state develop procurement policies, procedures, and materials that encourage and facilitate state agency purchase of goods and services from Washington small businesses.</p>

<p>The director shall adopt and apply rules designed to provide for some reciprocity in bidding between Washington and those states having statutes or regulations on the list under RCW 39.26.270. The director shall have broad discretionary power in developing these rules and the rules shall provide for reciprocity only to the extent and in those instances where the director considers it appropriate. For the purpose of determining the lowest responsible bidder pursuant to RCW 39.26.160, such rules shall (1) require the director to impose a reciprocity increase on bids when appropriate under the rules and (2) establish methods for determining the amount of the increase. In no instance shall such increase, if any, be paid to a vendor whose bid is accepted.</p>

<p>No later than September 1, 2020, the department of social and health services, the department of children, youth, and families, the health care authority, and the department of labor and industries must purchase in-person spoken language interpreter services directly from language access providers as defined in RCW 74.04.025, or through limited contracts with scheduling and coordinating delivery organizations, or both. Each state agency must have at least one contract with an entity that provides interpreter services through telephonic and video remote technologies. Nothing in this section precludes the department of labor and industries from purchasing in-person spoken language interpreter services directly from language access providers or from directly reimbursing language access providers.</p>

<p>Upon the expiration of any contract in effect on June 7, 2018, but no later than September 1, 2020, the department must develop and implement a model that all state agencies must use to procure spoken language interpreter services by purchasing directly from language access providers or through contracts with scheduling and coordinating entities, or both. The department must have at least one contract with an entity that provides interpreter services through telephonic and video remote technologies. If the department determines it is more cost-effective or efficient, it may jointly purchase these services with the department of social and health services, the department of children, youth, and families, the health care authority, and the department of labor and industries as provided in subsection (3) of this section. The department of social and health services, the department of children, youth, and families, the health care authority, and the department of labor and industries have the authority to procure interpreters through the department if the demand for spoken language interpreters cannot be met through their respective contracts.</p>

<li>
<p>All interpreter services procured under this section must be provided by language access providers who are certified or authorized by the state, or nationally certified by the certification commission for health care interpreters or the national board for certification of medical interpreters.
