<p>This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preference contained in section 1, chapter . . ., Laws of 2022 (section 1 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature categorizes this tax preference as one intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers, as indicated by RCW 82.32.808(2)(a).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to discourage the use of gas-powered outdoor power equipment and instead encourage the use of zero emission outdoor power equipment. It is the legislature's intent to support, through tax policy, reductions in greenhouse gas and conventional air pollutant emissions associated with outdoor power equipment usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To measure the effectiveness of this tax preference in achieving the specific public policy objective described in subsection (2) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee must, at minimum, review:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The number of taxpayers that receive the preference established in section 1 of this act;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The total sales tax exempted as a result of the preference established in section 1 of this act;</p>
</li>

<p>The total tax paid as a result of the air quality improvement tax established in RCW 82.08.020(6);</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The average per taxpayer exemption, calculated by dividing (b)(i) by (a)(i) of this subsection;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The average per taxpayer air quality improvement tax paid, calculated by dividing (b)(ii) by (a)(ii) of this subsection;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The net effect on state revenues as a result of the preference established in section 1 of this act together with the air quality improvement tax established in RCW 82.08.020(6), calculated by subtracting (b)(i) from (b)(ii) of this subsection; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the extent practicable and that such data is available:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The amount of benefit to taxpayers in each county of the state as a result of the tax preference established in section 1 of this act;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cost to taxpayers in each county of the state as a result of the air quality improvement tax established in RCW 82.08.020(6);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amount of tax preference applied to each type or category of zero emission outdoor power equipment; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amount of air quality improvement tax paid associated with each type or category of outdoor power equipment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The joint legislative audit and review committee must, to the greatest extent practicable, consider this preference in conjunction with the effects of the air quality improvement tax established in RCW 82.08.020(6).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The joint legislative audit and review committee may use any other data it deems necessary in performing the evaluation under this section.</p>
