<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that social media influencers can make significant amounts of money from the digital content they produce. Some influencers use their minor children as subjects of that content. Those children are generating interest in and revenue for the content, but receive no financial compensation for their participation. Unlike in child acting, these children are not playing a part, and lack legal protections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that social media influencers who market video content of their families, or &quot;vloggers&quot; can profit from the personal property rights of their children without restriction. Some children are filmed, with highly personal details of their lives shared on the internet for compensation, from birth. In addition to a severe loss of privacy, these children receive no consideration for the use and exchange of their personal property rights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to allow minors to receive proportional compensation for the use of specified personal property rights where their parents have reached a specified profit threshold from that use. The legislature also intends to provide for minors to exercise control over specified personal property rights upon reaching the age of majority.</p>
