# Substitute House Bill 1127 as Recommended by Health Care & Wellness

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/House%20Bills/1127-S.xml)
## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that the public health system must use all available and effective tools to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 and save lives in Washington. Public health case investigation, testing, and contact tracing are traditional, trusted public health tools used to control the spread of communicable diseases and are subject to laws and policies protecting health information privacy. As the economy reopens, the staggering number of COVID-19 cases continue to test capacity of the public health system's ability to control COVID-19. In an effort to increase the system's capacity, academic institutions and technology companies have recently developed digital tools, including web and mobile applications, to assist local and state public health agencies with contact tracing efforts.

2. The legislature finds that it is imperative to strike a balance between supporting innovative tools that increase the public health system's capacity while also providing equitable protections for the privacy and security of individual's COVID-19 health data and assuring individuals that collected data will not be used for law enforcement or immigration purposes. Achieving this balance is critical to reassure every Washingtonian, that any data collected by digital tools will be used in a private, secure, and legitimate manner and to support the use of all available tools to reduce the spread of COVID-19, particularly among vulnerable populations, and save lives in Washington.

3. Therefore, the legislature intends to establish privacy and security standards for these digital tools to provide protections for all Washingtonian's COVID-19 health data.
