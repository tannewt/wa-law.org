<p>The legislature finds that the state of Washington has been selling the personal data of its citizens to third-party vendors. This practice violates the state's obligation to respect and protect its citizens' personal property and it must come to an end. The legislature therefore intends to prohibit state agencies from selling personal data to third parties.</p>
