<p>The legislature finds that while voting by mail in Washington has increased turnout in elections, this increase in turnout has come at the expense of ballot security. No longer do voters have the privacy of a voting booth or the security of a polling place, but instead they are subject to potential intimidation, electioneering, and fraud while filling out and casting a ballot.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that trust in the electoral system across the United States has declined due to credible allegations of voter fraud, ballot tampering, and foreign interference in elections. As a result, it is important to institute an electoral process that not only secures the vote from fraud, tampering, and interference, but also restores trust that the outcomes are legitimate and that the election was free and fair.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the legislature intends to ensure ballot security and restore trust in electoral outcomes by reimplementing in-person voting in Washington, while continuing to provide ballot access to those who most need it by allowing for limited absentee voting.</p>
