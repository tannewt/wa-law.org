<p>The legislature finds that the traditional process of awarding public works contracts in lump sum to the lowest responsible bidder is a fair and objective method of selecting a contractor. However, under certain circumstances, alternative public works contracting procedures may best serve the public interest if such procedures are implemented in an open and fair process based on objective and equitable criteria. The purpose of this chapter is to authorize the use of certain supplemental alternative public works contracting procedures, to prescribe appropriate requirements to ensure that such contracting procedures serve the public interest, and to establish a process for evaluation of such contracting procedures. It is the intent of the legislature to establish that, unless otherwise specifically provided for in law, public bodies may use only those alternative public works contracting procedures specifically authorized in this chapter, subject to the requirements of this chapter.</p>

Based on the evaluation committee's findings, the public body shall select not more than five responsive and responsible finalists to submit proposals. The public body may, in its sole discretion, reject all proposals and shall provide its reasons for rejection in writing to all proposers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The public body must notify all proposers of the finalists selected to move to the next phase of the selection process. The process may not proceed to the next phase until two business days after all proposers are notified of the committee's selection decision. At the request of a proposer not selected as a finalist, the public body must provide the requesting proposer with a scoring summary of the evaluation factors for its proposal. Proposers filing a protest on the selection of the finalists must file the protest in accordance with the published protest procedures.

<li>
<p>The public body shall notify all finalists of the selection decision and make a selection summary of the final proposals available to all proposers within two business days of such notification. If the public body receives a timely written protest from a finalist firm, the public body may not execute a contract until two business days after the final protest decision is transmitted to the protestor. The protestor must submit its protest in accordance with the published protest procedures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The firm awarded the contract shall provide a performance and payment bond for the contracted amount.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any contract must require the firm awarded the contract to track and report to the public body and to the office of minority and women's business enterprises its utilization of the office of minority and women's business enterprises certified businesses and veteran certified businesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The public body shall provide appropriate honorarium payments to finalists submitting responsive proposals that are not awarded a design-build contract.

When using the alternative selection process, the general contractor/construction manager should select the subcontractor early in the life of the public works project.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In order to use this alternative selection process, the general contractor/construction manager and the public body must determine that it is in the best interest of the public. In making this determination the general contractor/construction manager and the public body must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Publish a notice of intent to use this alternative selection process in the same legal newspaper where the public solicitation of proposals is published. The general contractor/construction manager and public body are encouraged to post the notice in additional areas beyond the legal newspaper as required under this subsection, such as websites for business associations, the office of minority and women's business enterprises, and other locations and mediums that will further publicize the intent to use this alternative selection process. Notice must be published at least fourteen calendar days before conducting a public hearing. The notice must include the date, time, and location of the hearing; a statement justifying the basis and need for the alternative selection process; [and] how interested parties may, prior to the hearing, obtain the following: (i) The evaluation criteria and applicable weight given to each criteria that will be used for evaluation, including clear definitions of what should be considered specified general conditions work and what should be considered the fee; and (ii) protest procedures including time limits for filing a protest, which may, in no event, limit the time to file a protest to fewer than four business days from the date the proposer was notified of the selection decision. The evaluation criteria, weights assigned to each criteria, and justification for using this selection process must be made available upon request at least seven calendar days before the public hearing;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conduct a hearing and provide an opportunity for any interested party to submit written and verbal comments regarding the justification for using this selection process, the evaluation criteria, weights for each criteria, and protest procedures;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the public hearing, consider the written and verbal comments received and determine if using this alternative selection process is in the best interests of the public; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issue a written final determination to all interested parties. The final determination shall state the reasons the alternative selection process is determined to be in the best interests of the public and shall reasonably address the comments received regarding the criteria and weights for each criterion. Any modifications to the criteria, weights, and protest procedures based on comments received during the public hearing process must be included in the final determination. All protests of the decision to use the alternative selection process must be in writing and submitted to the public body within seven calendar days of the final determination. The public body shall not proceed with the selection process until after responding in writing to the protest.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contracts for the services of a subcontractor under this section must be awarded through a competitive process requiring a public solicitation of proposals. Notice of the public solicitation of proposals must be provided to the office of minority and women's business enterprises. The public solicitation of proposals must include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A description of the project, including programmatic, performance, and technical requirements and specifications when available, along with a description of the project's unique aspects, complexities, and challenges;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reasons for using the alternative selection process;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A description of the minimum qualifications required of the firm;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A description of the process used to evaluate qualifications and proposals, including evaluation factors and the relative weight of factors;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protest procedures;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The form of the contract, including any contract for preconstruction services, to be awarded;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The estimated maximum allowable subcontract cost; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bid instructions to be used by the finalists.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluation factors for selection of the subcontractor must include, but not be limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Ability of the firm's professional personnel to deliver projects similar in size, scope, or complexity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The firm's past performance on projects similar in size, scope, or complexity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The firm's ability to meet time and budget requirements on projects similar in size, scope, or complexity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The scope of work the firm proposes to perform with its own forces and its ability to perform that work;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The firm's plan for inclusion of disadvantaged business enterprises, to the extent permitted by law;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The firm's proximity to the project location;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The firm's approach to executing the project based on its delivery of other projects similar in size, scope, or complexity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The firm's approach to safety on the project;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The firm's safety history;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If interviews are part of the selection process, the solicitation shall describe how interviews will be scored or evaluated, and evaluations shall be included in the written selection summary; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the firm is selected as one of the most qualified finalists, the firm's fee and cost proposal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The general contractor/construction manager shall establish a committee to evaluate the proposals. At least one representative from the public body shall serve on the committee. Final proposals, including sealed bids for the percent fee on the estimated maximum allowable subcontract cost, and the fixed amount for the subcontract general conditions work specified in the request for proposal, will be requested from the most qualified firms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The general contractor/construction manager must notify all proposers of the most qualified firms that will move to the next phase of the selection process. The process may not proceed to the next phase until two business days after all proposers are notified of the committee's selection decision. At the request of a proposer, the general contractor/construction manager must provide the requesting proposer with a scoring summary of the evaluation factors for its proposal. Proposers filing a protest on the selection of the most qualified finalists must file the protest with the public body in accordance with the published protest procedures. The selection process may not advance to the next phase of selection until two business days after the final protest decision issued by the public body is transmitted to the protestor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The general contractor/construction manager and the public body shall select the firm submitting the highest scored final proposal using the evaluation factors and the relative weight of factors identified in the solicitation of proposals. Scoring of the nonprice factors shall be added to the scoring of the fee and cost proposals to determine the highest scored firm. The scoring of the nonprice factors must be made available at the public opening of the fee and cost proposals. The general contractor/construction manager shall notify all proposers of the selection decision and make a selection summary of the final proposals, which shall be available to all proposers within two business days of such notification. The general contractor/construction manager may not evaluate or disqualify a proposal based on the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the public body receives a timely written protest from a &quot;most qualified firm,&quot; the general contractor/construction manager may not execute a contract for the protested subcontract work until two business days after the final protest decision issued by the public body is transmitted to the protestor. The protestor must submit its protest in accordance with the published protest procedures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the general contractor/construction manager is unable to negotiate a satisfactory maximum allowable subcontract cost with the firm selected deemed by public body and the general contractor/construction manager to be fair, reasonable, and within the available funds, negotiations with that firm must be formally terminated and the general contractor/construction manager may negotiate with the next highest scored firm until an agreement is reached or the process is terminated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the approval of the public body, the general contractor/construction manager may contract with the selected firm to provide preconstruction services during the design phase that may include life-cycle cost design considerations, value engineering, scheduling, cost estimating, constructability, alternative construction options for cost savings, and sequencing of work; and to act as the subcontractor during the construction phase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maximum allowable subcontract cost must be used to establish a total subcontract cost for purposes of a performance and payment bond. Total subcontract cost means the fixed amount for the detailed specified general conditions work, the negotiated maximum allowable subcontract cost, and the percent fee on the negotiated maximum allowable subcontract cost. Maximum allowable subcontract cost means the maximum cost to complete the work specified for the subcontract, including the estimated cost of work to be performed by the subcontractor's own forces, a percentage for risk contingency, negotiated support services, and approved change orders. The maximum allowable subcontract cost must be negotiated between the general contractor/construction manager and the selected firm when the construction documents and specifications are at least ninety percent complete. Final agreement on the maximum allowable subcontract cost is subject to the approval of the public body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the work of the subcontractor is completed for less than the maximum allowable subcontract cost, any savings not otherwise negotiated as part of an incentive clause becomes part of the risk contingency included in the general contractor/construction manager's maximum allowable construction cost. If the work of the subcontractor is completed for more than the maximum allowable subcontract cost, the additional cost is the responsibility of that subcontractor. An independent audit, paid for by the public body, must be conducted to confirm the proper accrual of costs. The public body or general contractor/construction manager shall define the scope of the audit in the contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A subcontractor selected under this section may perform work with its own forces. In the event it elects to subcontract some of its work, it must select a subcontractor utilizing the procedure outlined in RCW 39.10.380.</p>

All extensions or renewals must be priced as provided in the request for proposals. The extension or renewal must be mutually agreed to by the public body and the job order contractor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A public body may have no more than three job order contracts in effect at any one time, with the exception of the department of enterprise services, which may have six job order contracts in effect at any one time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least 90 percent of work contained in a job order contract must be subcontracted to entities other than the job order contractor. The job order contractor must distribute contracts as equitably as possible among qualified and available subcontractors including certified minority and woman-owned subcontractors to the extent permitted by law as demonstrated on the subcontractor and supplier project submission, and shall limit subcontractor bonding requirements to the greatest extent possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The job order contractor shall publish notification of intent to perform public works projects at the beginning of each contract year in a statewide publication and in a legal newspaper of general circulation in every county in which the public works projects are anticipated. The job order contractor is encouraged to post the notification of intent to perform public works projects in other areas, such as websites for business associations, the office of minority and women's business enterprises, and other locations and mediums that will further publicize subcontractor opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Job order contractors shall pay prevailing wages for all work that would otherwise be subject to the requirements of chapter 39.12 RCW. Prevailing wages for all work performed pursuant to each work order must be the rates in effect at the time the individual work order is issued.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If, in the initial contract term, the public body, at no fault of the job order contractor, fails to issue the minimum amount of work orders stated in the public request for proposals, the public body shall pay the contractor an amount equal to the difference between the minimum work order amount and the actual total of the work orders issued multiplied by an appropriate percentage for overhead and profit contained in the contract award coefficient for services as specified in the request for proposals. This is the contractor's sole remedy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All job order contracts awarded under this section must be signed before July 1, 2031; however the job order contract may be extended or renewed as provided for in this section.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The demonstrated lack of availability of apprentices in specific geographic areas;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A disproportionately high ratio of material costs to labor hours, which does not make feasible the required minimum levels of apprentice participation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participating contractors have demonstrated a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of RCW 39.04.300 and 39.04.310; or</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Provide the reasons for using the general contractor/construction manager procedure, including a clear statement that the public body is electing to procure the project as a heavy civil construction project;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indicate the minimum percentage of the cost of the work to construct the project that will constitute the negotiated self-perform portion of the project;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indicate whether the public body will allow the price to be paid for the negotiated self-perform portion of the project to be deemed a cost of the work to which the general contractor/construction manager's percent fee applies; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Require proposals to indicate the proposer's fee for the negotiated self-perform portion of the project;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>As part of the negotiation of the maximum allowable construction cost established in RCW 39.10.370(1), the general contractor/construction manager shall submit a proposed construction management and contracting plan, which must include, at a minimum:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The scope of work and cost estimates for each bid package;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A proposed price and scope of work for the negotiated self-perform portion of the project;</p>

<li>
<p>The bases used by the general contractor/construction manager to develop all cost estimates, including the negotiated self-perform portion of the project; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The general contractor/construction manager's updated inclusion plan for small business entities, disadvantaged business enterprises, and any other disadvantaged or underutilized businesses as the public body may designate in the public solicitation of proposals, as subcontractors and suppliers for the project;</p>

<li>
<p>The public body and general contractor/construction manager may negotiate the scopes of work to be procured by bid and the price and scope of work for the negotiated self-perform portion of the project, if any;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The negotiated self-perform portion of the project must not exceed 50 percent of the cost of the work to construct the project;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this chapter, for a project that a public body has elected to procure as a heavy civil construction project under this chapter, at least 30 percent of the cost of the work to construct the project included in the negotiated maximum allowable construction cost must be procured through competitive sealed bidding in which bidding by the general contractor/construction manager or its subsidiaries is prohibited;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to the limitation of subsection (5) of this section, the public body may additionally negotiate with the general contractor/construction manager to determine on which scopes of work the general contractor/construction manager will be permitted to bid, if any;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The public body and general contractor/construction manager shall negotiate, to the public body's satisfaction, a fair and reasonable inclusion plan;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the public body is unable to negotiate to its reasonable satisfaction a component of this section, negotiations with the firm must be terminated and the public body shall negotiate with the next highest scored firm and continue until an agreement is reached or the process is terminated; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a project procured as a heavy civil construction project, an independent audit, paid for by the public body, must be conducted to confirm the proper accrual of costs as outlined in the contract. The public body shall define the scope of the audit in the contract.</p>
