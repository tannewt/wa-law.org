<p>This section provides an alternative process for awarding contracts for construction, building, renovation, remodeling, alteration, repair, or improvement of university buildings and facilities in which critical patient care or highly specialized medical research is located. These provisions may be used, in lieu of other procedures to award contracts for such work, when the estimated cost of the work is equal to or less than five million dollars and the project involves construction, renovation, remodeling, or alteration of improvements within a building that is used directly for critical patient care or highly specialized medical research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The university may create a single critical patient care or specialized medical research facilities roster or may create multiple critical patient care or specialized medical research facilities rosters for different trade specialties or categories of anticipated work. At least once a year, the university shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation and with the office of minority and women's business enterprises, a notice of the existence of the roster or rosters and solicit a statement of qualifications from contractors who wish to be on the roster or rosters of prime contractors. In addition, qualified contractors shall be added to the roster or rosters at any time they submit a written request, necessary records, and meet the qualifications established by the university. The university may require eligible contractors desiring to be placed on a roster to keep current records of any applicable licenses, certifications, registrations, bonding, insurance, or other appropriate matters on file with the university with input from the women-owned and minority-owned business community as a condition of being placed on a roster or rosters. Placement on a roster shall be on the basis of qualifications.</p>

<p>The public solicitation of qualifications shall include but not be limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A description of the types of projects to be completed and where possible may include programmatic, performance, and technical requirements and specifications;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reasons for using the critical patient care and specialized medical research roster process;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A description of the qualifications to be required of a contractor, including submission of an accident prevention program;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Contractors meeting the evaluation committee's criteria for selection must be placed on the applicable roster or rosters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a project is selected for delivery through this roster process, the university must establish a procedure for securing written quotations from all contractors on a roster to assure that a competitive price is established. Invitations for quotations shall include an estimate of the scope and nature of the work to be performed as well as materials and equipment to be furnished. Plans and specifications must be included in the invitation but may not be detailed. Award of a project must be made to the responsible bidder submitting the lowest responsive bid.</p>

<p>The maximum dollar amount for a work order is five hundred thousand dollars, excluding Washington state sales and use tax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All work orders issued for the same project shall be treated as a single work order for purposes of the dollar limit on work orders.</p>

<p>A public body may issue no work orders under a job order contract until it has approved, in consultation with the office of minority and women's business enterprises or the equivalent local agency, a plan prepared by the job order contractor that equitably spreads certified women and minority business enterprise subcontracting opportunities among the various subcontract disciplines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of chapters 39.08, 39.12, 39.76, and 60.28 RCW, each work order issued shall be treated as a separate contract. The alternate filing provisions of RCW 39.12.040(2) apply to each work order that otherwise meets the eligibility requirements of RCW 39.12.040(2).</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The demonstrated lack of availability of apprentices in specific geographic areas;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A disproportionately high ratio of material costs to labor hours, which does not make feasible the required minimum levels of apprentice participation;</p>
