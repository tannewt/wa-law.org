<blockquote>
<p>This section adds a new section to an existing chapter <a href="/rcw/71_mental_illness/71.24_community_behavioral_health_services_act.html">71.24</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/71_mental_illness/71.24_community_behavioral_health_services_act.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The authority shall establish a substance use recovery services plan to implement measures to assist persons with substance use disorder in accessing outreach, treatment, and recovery support services that are low-barrier, person-centered, informed by people with lived experience, and culturally and linguistically appropriate. The plan must articulate the manner in which continual, rapid, and widespread access to a comprehensive continuum of care will be provided to all persons with substance use disorder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The plan must consider:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The manner in which persons with substance use disorder currently access and interact with the behavioral health system;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The points of intersection that persons with substance use disorder have with the health care, criminal, legal, and child welfare systems, including emergency departments, syringe service programs, law enforcement, correctional facilities, and dependency court; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The various locations in which persons with untreated substance use disorder congregate, including homeless encampments, motels, and casinos.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The plan must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Address the effects of establishing personal use amounts of controlled substances, counterfeit substances, and legend drugs as provided in RCW 69.50.101;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include potential new community-based care access points, including the safe station model in partnership with fire departments;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include strategic grant making to community organizations to educate the public to eliminate stigma and prejudice against persons with substance use disorder by improving public understanding and promoting hope;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include innovative mechanisms for real-time, peer-driven, noncoercive outreach and engagement to individuals in active substance use disorder across all settings and develop measures to enhance the effectiveness of and opportunities for intervention across new and existing points of contact with this population; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support diversion to community-based care for individuals who may face criminal consequences for other drug-related law violations, but for whom it is evident that a response that addresses and attends to the underlying behavioral health needs and social determinants of health may be more effective.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The plan and related rules adopted by the authority must include the following substance use treatment and recovery services, which must be available in or accessible by all jurisdictions: Field-based outreach and engagement; peer recovery support services; intensive case management; substance use disorder treatment, including evidence-based treatment, promising practices, and innovative approaches; and recovery support services including housing, job training, and placement services. These services must be equitably distributed across urban and rural settings and, if possible, made available on demand through 24 hour, seven days a week peer recovery coach response, behavioral health triage centers, or other innovative rapid response models. These services must, at a minimum, incorporate the following principles: Low barrier to entry and reentry; improve the health and safety of the individual; reduce the harm of substance use and related activity for the public; integrated and coordinated services; incorporate structural competency and antiracism; noncoercive methods of retaining people in treatment and recovery services, including contingency management; consideration of the unique needs of rural communities; and services that increase social determinants of health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In developing the plan, the authority shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Provide due consideration to the adoption and implementation of the recommendations of the substance use recovery services advisory committee established in section 2 of this act. Where adoption and implementation of recommendations are infeasible, the authority shall notify the advisory committee and request refinement or modification of recommendations for implementation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Align the components of the plan with previous and ongoing studies, plans, and reports, including the Washington state opioid overdose and response plan, published by the authority, the roadmap to recovery planning grant strategy being developed by the authority, and plans associate with federal block grants; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coordinate its work with the efforts of the blue ribbon commission on the intersection of the criminal justice and behavioral health crisis systems established in the governor's executive order 21-02 and the crisis response improvement strategy committee established in chapter . . . (Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill No. 1477), Laws of 2021.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority must submit the substance use recovery services plan to the governor and the legislature by December 1, 2021. After submitting the plan, the authority shall adopt rules and enter into contracts with providers to implement the plan by December 1, 2022. In addition to seeking public comment under chapter 34.05 RCW, the authority must adopt rules in accordance with the recommendations of the substance use recovery services advisory committee as provided in subsection (5) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority must submit a readiness report to the governor and the legislature by November 1, 2022, that indicates progress on the substance use disorder continuum of care, including availability of outreach, treatment, and recovery support services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In consultation with the substance use recovery services advisory committee, the authority must submit a report on the implementation of the substance use recovery services plan to the appropriate committees of the legislature and governor by December 1st of each year, beginning in 2022.</p>

<p>The authority shall establish uniform program standards for behavioral health administrative services organizations to follow in the design of their community-based outreach and intensive case management programs. The uniform program standards must be modeled upon the components of the law enforcement assisted diversion program and address project management, field engagement, biopsychosocial assessment, intensive case management and care coordination, stabilization housing when available and appropriate, and, as necessary, legal system coordination. The authority must adapt the uniform program standards from the components of the law enforcement assisted diversion program to accommodate an expanded population of persons with substance use disorder and allow for referrals from a broad range of sources. The expanded population must include both persons who use controlled substances, counterfeit substances, and legend drugs within the personal use amount as provided in RCW 69.50.101 and persons whose use exceeds the personal use amount. In addition to accepting referrals from law enforcement, the uniform program standards must provide guidance for accepting referrals on behalf of an individual with substance use disorder from various sources including, but not limited to, self-referral, family members of the individual, emergency department personnel, persons engaged with serving homeless encampments, safe station program personnel, fire department personnel, emergency medical service personnel, community-based organizations, members of the business community, harm reduction program personnel, faith-based organization staff, and other sources within the criminal justice system, as outlined within the sequential intercept model. In developing response time requirements within the statewide program standards, the authority shall require that responses to referrals from law enforcement occur immediately for in custody referrals.</p>

<p>NOTE: References in the grid to days or weeks mean periods of confinement. &quot;LS&quot; means &quot;local sanctions&quot; as defined in RCW 13.40.020.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The vertical axis of the grid is the current offense category. The current offense category is determined by the offense of adjudication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The horizontal axis of the grid is the number of prior adjudications included in the juvenile's criminal history. Each prior felony adjudication shall count as one point. Each prior violation, misdemeanor, and gross misdemeanor adjudication shall count as 1/4 point. Fractional points shall be rounded down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The standard range disposition for each offense is determined by the intersection of the column defined by the prior adjudications and the row defined by the current offense category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RCW 13.40.180 applies if the offender is being sentenced for more than one offense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A current offense that is a violation is equivalent to an offense category of E. However, a disposition for a violation shall not include confinement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the offender is subject to a standard range disposition involving confinement by the department, the court may impose the standard range and suspend the disposition on condition that the offender comply with one or more local sanctions and any educational or treatment requirement. The treatment programs provided to the offender must be either research-based best practice programs as identified by the Washington state institute for public policy or the joint legislative audit and review committee, or for chemical dependency treatment programs or services, they must be evidence-based or research-based best practice programs. For the purposes of this subsection:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Evidence-based&quot; means a program or practice that has had multiple site random controlled trials across heterogeneous populations demonstrating that the program or practice is effective for the population; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Research-based&quot; means a program or practice that has some research demonstrating effectiveness, but that does not yet meet the standard of evidence-based practices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the offender fails to comply with the suspended disposition, the court may impose sanctions pursuant to RCW 13.40.200 or may revoke the suspended disposition and order the disposition's execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An offender is ineligible for the suspended disposition option under this section if the offender:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Is adjudicated of an A+ or A++ offense;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is fourteen years of age or older and is adjudicated of one or more of the following offenses:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>A class A offense, or an attempt, conspiracy, or solicitation to commit a class A offense;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manslaughter in the first degree (RCW 9A.32.060);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assault in the second degree (RCW 9A.36.021), extortion in the first degree (RCW 9A.56.120), kidnapping in the second degree (RCW 9A.40.030), drive-by shooting (RCW 9A.36.045), vehicular homicide (RCW 46.61.520), hit and run death (RCW 46.52.020(4)(a)), or manslaughter 2 (RCW 9A.32.070); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Violation of the uniform controlled substances act (RCW 69.50.401(2) (a) and (b)), when the offense includes infliction of bodily harm upon another or when during the commission or immediate withdrawal from the offense the respondent was armed with a deadly weapon;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is ordered to serve a disposition for a firearm violation under RCW 13.40.193;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is adjudicated of a sex offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has a prior option B disposition.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the juvenile offender is subject to a standard range disposition of local sanctions or 15 to 36 weeks of confinement and has not committed a B++ or B+ offense, the court may impose a disposition under RCW 13.40.160(4) and 13.40.165.</p>
<p>If the court determines that a disposition under option A, B, or C would effectuate a manifest injustice, the court shall impose a disposition outside the standard range under RCW 13.40.160(2).</p>
