<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">

<li>
<p>A strong diversity, equity, and inclusion strategic recruitment and retention plan is necessary to:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Provide the state patrol with the benefits of a diverse workforce, improving service to the public, increasing employee productivity, and providing new perspectives and innovative approaches to achieving the agency's mission of enhancing the safety and security of all people and communities; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fill vacancies with those who are from historically and currently marginalized communities;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public employment opportunities at the Washington state patrol should provide all commissioned and noncommissioned staff full access to the opportunities, power, and resources each needs in the staff person's career; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The transition to a culture that fosters workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion requires steadfast commitment over the long term.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Challenge the state patrol to change and adapt its culture to attract and retain a diverse workforce representative of those who have been historically and currently marginalized and is representative of the labor force as a whole;</p>

<p>Establish effective legislative and executive oversight mechanisms to increase workforce parity by eliminating disparities in the state patrol's workforce;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase accountability and transparency relating to the state patrol's progress in achieving equity in its workforce; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide technical assistance and support for the state patrol's diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts over the long term.</p>
