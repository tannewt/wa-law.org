<ol>
<li>
<p>No hospital or its medical staff shall adopt or maintain admission practices or policies which result in:</p>

No hospital which maintains an emergency department shall transfer a patient with an emergency medical condition or who is in active labor unless the transfer is performed at the request of the patient or is due to the limited medical resources of the transferring hospital. Hospitals must follow reasonable procedures in making transfers to other hospitals including confirmation of acceptance of the transfer by the receiving hospital.</p>

<li>
<p>For the purpose of providing charity care, each hospital shall develop, implement, and maintain a  policy which shall enable <strong>indigent persons</strong> access to <strong>charity care. The policy shall include procedures for identifying patients****who may be eligible for health care coverage through medical assistance programs under chapter 74.09 RCW or the Washington health benefit exchange and actively assisting patients to apply for any available coverage. A hospital is not obligated to provide charity care under this section to any patient or patient's guarantor if the hospital has identified the patient as potentially eligible for retroactive health care coverage through medical assistance programs under chapter 74.09 RCW and the patient or the patient's guarantor refuses to apply for such coverage.</strong></p>
