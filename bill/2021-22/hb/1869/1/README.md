# House Bill 1869

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/House%20Bills/1869.xml)
## Section 1
The legislature intends to provide a voluntary option for cities and counties planning to incorporate salmon recovery into their planning under the growth management act. The legislature intends to do this in a way that provides for meaningful and measurable improvement in the protection and enhancement of habitat for anadromous fish. The legislature intends to do this without increasing the liability of cities and counties and their taxpayers, and in a way that encourages rather than discourages the voluntary participation of private landowners in projects that will improve habitat in a watershed.


## Section 2

## Section 3
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [36.70A](/rcw/36_counties/36.070A_growth_management—planning_by_selected_counties_and_cities.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/36_counties/36.070A_growth_management—planning_by_selected_counties_and_cities.md) for context.

1. If a city or county chooses to adopt an optional salmon recovery element within its comprehensive plan pursuant to RCW 36.70A.080, the salmon recovery element must comply with this section and sections 4 through 8 of this act.

2. As part of an optional salmon recovery element, a county or city must develop a work plan that is designed to result in an improvement in anadromous fish habitat. The work plan may address, among other elements, in-water and upland habitats, vegetation, water quantity, water quality, and other natural features within the county or city that contribute to anadromous fish habitat on a watershed basis, including applicable elements of salmon recovery plans adopted pursuant to the federal endangered species act. The work plan must include goals and benchmarks for the protection and enhancement of the natural features within the county or city that contribute to anadromous fish habitat on a watershed basis. In developing and implementing the work plan, the county or city must:

    a. Review and incorporate applicable water quality, watershed management, and species recovery data and plans, including the applicable elements of salmon recovery plans adopted pursuant to the endangered species act;

    b. Seek input from tribes, agencies, and stakeholders;

    c. Develop goals for participation by landowners in the county or city necessary to meet the protection and enhancement benchmarks of the work plan;

    d. Ensure outreach and technical assistance is provided to landowners in the county or city;

    e. Create measurable benchmarks that, within 10 years after the receipt of funding, are designed to result in the protection and enhancement of the functions and values of the natural features that contribute to anadromous fish habitat on a watershed basis through voluntary, incentive-based measures;

    f. Designate the entity or entities that will provide technical assistance;

    g. Work with the entity providing technical assistance to ensure that individual stewardship plans contribute to the goals and benchmarks of the work plan;

    h. Incorporate into the work plan any existing development regulations relied upon to achieve the goals and benchmarks for protection;

    i. Establish baseline monitoring for: (i) Participation activities and implementation of the voluntary salmon recovery plans and projects; (ii) stewardship activities; and (iii) existing environmental conditions related to the functions and values of the natural features that contribute to anadromous fish habitat on a watershed basis;

    j. Conduct periodic evaluations, institute adaptive management, and provide a written report of the status of plans and accomplishments to the department of fish and wildlife within 60 days after the end of each biennium; and

    k. Assist state agencies in their monitoring programs.

3. [Empty]

    a. The county or city shall develop and submit the work plan to the department of fish and wildlife for approval as provided in section 4 of this act.

        i. Not later than five years after the receipt of funding for a participating county or city, and every five years thereafter, the county or city must report to the department of fish and wildlife on whether it has met the work plan's protection and enhancement goals and benchmarks.

        ii. If the county or city determines the protection and enhancement goals and benchmarks have been met, and the department of fish and wildlife concurs under section 5 of this act, the county or city shall continue to implement the work plan.

        iii. If the county or city determines the protection and enhancement goals and benchmarks have not been met, it must propose and submit to the department of fish and wildlife an adaptive management plan to achieve the goals and benchmarks that were not met. The adaptive management plan must identify what additional voluntary actions are needed to meet the benchmarks and must identify the funding necessary to implement these actions. If the department of fish and wildlife does not approve the adaptive management plan under section 5 of this act, the watershed is subject to the provisions of section 6 of this act.

        iv. The county or city must implement the actions identified in the adaptive management plan when funding is provided.

4. Following approval of a work plan, a county or city may request that a state or federal agency, or both, focus existing enforcement authority in that county or city, if the action will facilitate progress toward achieving work plan protection goals and benchmarks.

5. Landowners participating in the program are eligible to receive funding and assistance under the voluntary salmon recovery program.

        ii. The department of fish and wildlife must advise the county or city of the reasons for disapproval.

4. The county or city may, within 180 days of receipt of the reasons for the panel's determination, modify and resubmit its work plan for review and approval consistent with this section.

5. If the department of fish and wildlife does not approve a work plan submitted under this section within two years and nine months after receipt of funding, the department of fish and wildlife shall submit the work plan to the statewide salmon recovery advisory committee for resolution. If the statewide salmon recovery advisory committee recommends approval, the department of fish and wildlife must approve the work plan.

6. If the department of fish and wildlife does not approve a work plan for a county or city within three years after receipt of funding, the provisions of section 6 of this act apply to the county or city.

1. If the department of fish and wildlife, following receipt of a report pursuant to section 3 of this act, concludes that the work plan goals and benchmarks for enhancement and protection have not been met, the department of fish and wildlife must consult with the statewide salmon recovery advisory committee for a recommendation on how to proceed. If the department of fish and wildlife, acting upon recommendation from the statewide salmon recovery advisory committee, determines that the county or city is likely to meet the goals and benchmarks with an additional six months of planning and implementation time, the department of fish and wildlife shall grant an extension. If the department of fish and wildlife, acting upon a recommendation from the statewide salmon recovery advisory committee, determines that the county or city is unlikely to meet the goals and benchmarks within six months, the county or city is subject to the provisions of section 6 of this act.
