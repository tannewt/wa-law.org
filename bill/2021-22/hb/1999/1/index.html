<blockquote>
<p>This section adds a new section to an existing chapter <a href="/rcw/43_state_government%E2%80%94executive/43.135_state_expenditures_limitations.html">43.135</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/43_state_government%E2%80%94executive/43.135_state_expenditures_limitations.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the cost of any state program or function is shifted from the state general fund or related funds on or after January 1, 2021, to another source of funding, or if moneys are transferred from the state general fund or related funds to another fund or account, the state expenditure limit committee, acting pursuant to RCW 43.135.025, shall lower the state expenditure limit to reflect the shift. For the purposes of this section, a transfer of money from the state general fund or related funds to another fund or account includes any state legislative action taken after July 1, 2021, that has the effect of reducing revenues from a particular source, where such revenues would otherwise be deposited into the state general fund or related funds, while increasing the revenues from that particular source to another state or local government account.</p>
