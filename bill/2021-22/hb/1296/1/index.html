<h2 id="section-1-1864">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1864">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that COVID-19 has had significant impacts on behavioral health. The legislature previously had a feature of its tax system that exempted government-funded behavioral health services from paying business and occupation tax in order for more tax dollars to be utilized in providing health services. The legislature intends to reenact that preference in light of increased behavioral health needs for the foreseeable future, and in recognition that treatment reduces costs to the government in other services.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-1464">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-1464">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preference contained in section 3, chapter . . ., Laws of 2021 (section 3 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or to be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature categorizes this tax preference as one intended to accomplish a general purpose, reducing taxes so more money can go directly to behavioral health services, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(f).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to support behavioral health services that can prevent more serious and costly health issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a review finds that the amount of funding available for behavioral health services by these taxpayers increased, then the legislature intends to extend the expiration date of the tax preference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may refer to any data collected by the state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
