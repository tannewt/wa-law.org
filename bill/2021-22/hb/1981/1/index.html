<p>The legislature finds that every Washington resident has a right to safe, healthy, secure, and affordable housing; and, that it is the responsibility of the state and all cities and counties to plan for all current and future residents within their jurisdictions of all income levels, race, ethnicities to have such housing.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that it has duties under existing statutes, including chapter 36.70A RCW, to provide funding for all cities and counties to plan for new required elements of comprehensive plans including, but not limited to, planning for affordable housing and meeting the goals of the state in reducing our contribution to climate change. The legislature recognizes that it has been difficult to project what the costs may be of planning for new elements pursuant to this act.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that the study provided for in RCW 36.70A.190, and updates to it periodically thereafter, shall determine what constitutes adequate funding for planning for new elements of comprehensive plans and for the adoption of implementing ordinances and development regulations pursuant to chapter 36.70A RCW for future comprehensive plan updates. By adopting the additional real estate excise tax in section 18 of this act for grants to support local planning, the development of ordinances, and to provide other assistance, in conjunction with authorization for local governments to increase local revenues for implementing this act, the legislature intends to provide adequate support for local governments to conduct planning and adopt ordinances and policies required by this act after fiscal year 2023.</p>

<p>(II) <strong>The jurisdiction shall provide for a net density of at least 16 residential units per acre relying on a mix of housing types, which may include multifamily housing. The jurisdiction may either utilize a floor area or lot size ratio to accomplish this level of density.</strong></p>
<pre><code>    iii. **Required increases in density, floor area ratio, or the types of housing units allowed on lots with existing housing units pursuant to this chapter or any new additions to this chapter effective after January 1, 2022, shall be incorporated into appropriate development regulations applicable in all subareas of a jurisdiction required to plan under this chapter within two years after the jurisdiction adopts its next comprehensive plan. Plans shall be based on findings and analyses in the record regarding whether infrastructure capacities in subareas of the jurisdiction are sufficient to meet the increased demands on infrastructure and services from the required allowance of new infill housing including, but not limited to:**
</code></pre>
<p>(A) <strong>Sewage, septic system, and stormwater capacity, including whether increased infill may have a significant adverse effect on standards of service, consent agreements, or orders to reduce overflows and discharges to surface waters, compliance with regulatory requirements, or clean water goals adopted by federal, state, and local agencies such as the Puget Sound partnership, department of ecology, department of health, or board of health, or a local health jurisdiction. For any area which the planning jurisdiction finds that sewer, septic, stormwater, or other utility infrastructure capacity is inadequate to support the increased infill housing required by this chapter, the jurisdiction shall either adopt an infrastructure plan to expand capacity over the course of the next two comprehensive plan cycles in consultation with all relevant utility providers, or document in the plan that expanded capacity would necessarily conflict with attaining compliance or meeting goals established pursuant to federal, state, or local environmental or health agencies. The findings and plan to provide infrastructure for areas shall be submitted to the department for review. The department shall coordinate comments from other relevant state agencies and formally transmit those comments to the city or county. Within 60 days of the receipt of the department's comments, findings that increasing infill are not attainable without conflicting with such other goals and requirements may be appealed to the growth management hearings board pursuant to RCW 36.70A.280;</strong></p>
<p>(B) <strong>School capacity, including not creating new violations, or exacerbating existing violations, of standards adopted by the state regarding the number of students in classes. This analysis shall be done in consultation with school districts serving the studied area. If inadequate capacity exists, the planning jurisdiction, in collaboration with the relevant school district or districts, shall adopt reasonable plans to accommodate such growth over the next decade. This shall include imposition of school impact fees authorized under RCW 82.02.050 as one element to meet capacity needs identified by the school district for specific areas in which school capacity will not meet standards due to the increased infill;</strong></p>
<p>(C) <strong>Drinking and domestic water sources. Increased infill otherwise required by this chapter shall not apply in any portion of a jurisdiction if it is found that the additional requirements for development of lots will adversely affect minimum instream flows established by the department of ecology or salmon and other endangered or threatened species recovery plans, groundwater protection plans, wetland, shoreline, tree canopy, or open space and species preservation goals or violation of the rights of federally recognized tribes to utilize resources under treaties;</strong></p>
<p>(D) <strong>Public safety services including fire and police. In any areas where increased infill required by this act would result in the inability of fire, emergency, and police services to respond without significant violation of standards, the implementation may be delayed by up to two years, and up to five years if the violation of standards relates to physical infrastructure such as water, if the jurisdiction submits findings to the department which demonstrate a need for delayed implementation accompanied by a plan which the department concurs will enable the jurisdiction to meet such service standards within a two-year period;</strong></p>
<p>(E) <strong>Plans to meet transportation needs of residents who are not within one-half mile of frequent transit, or who, due to disability, age, or geography may not be able to access transit or household shopping without violating goals adopted under this chapter or other state programs to reduce vehicle miles traveled and to meet goals to reduce the effects of development and transportation on climate change. Approval of new development under this section must meet requirements for concurrency pursuant to subsection (6)(b) of this section;</strong></p>
<p>(F) <strong>Electricity capacity, including electricity loads incurred from new housing and services from adding housing infill pursuant to this chapter to serve the entire needs of residential units for heating, cooling, and vehicle charging. In determining if adequate electrical capacity exists the planning jurisdiction shall consult with electric utility providers on demand projections and capacity. The planning jurisdiction may also include in its development regulations provisions to ensure residents have access to electric vehicle charging to meet state and local goals related to climate change. If increased housing infill will cause a risk of service interruption or other violation of expected service standards for a defined area of the planning jurisdiction, a deferment to provide increased capacity shall be approved by the department for no more than five years until development regulations for increased housing infill shall take effect; and</strong></p>
<p>(G) <strong>Open space and tree canopy goals adopted pursuant to this chapter, including ensuring that no resident in a jurisdiction resides more than one-half mile from open space with recreation for youth and undeveloped open space.</strong></p>
<pre><code>    iv. **The comprehensive plan shall describe the mechanisms which will be utilized, including interlocal agreements with transit providers, to ensure that transit frequency relied on in the plan, development regulations, and permitting decisions is continued and will not be diminished. For any area where such transit frequency is not reasonably assured, the level of required density or mix of housing required by this section shall not increase above that of the next lower level of density or housing mix required by this section.**

v. **In calculating net densities within one-quarter or one-half mile of frequent transit service under this section, a jurisdiction may choose to exclude critical areas and open space protected from development from the area on which such calculations are based;**

The intensification of development on lots containing, or new development of, small-scale recreational or tourist uses, including commercial facilities to serve those recreational or tourist uses, that rely on a rural location and setting, but that do not include new residential development. A small-scale recreation or tourist use is not required to be principally designed to serve the existing and projected rural population. Public services and public facilities shall be limited to those necessary to serve the recreation or tourist use and shall be provided in a manner that does not permit low-density sprawl;

    iii. The intensification of development on lots containing isolated nonresidential uses or new development of isolated cottage industries and isolated small-scale businesses that are not principally designed to serve the existing and projected rural population and nonresidential uses, but do provide job opportunities for rural residents. Rural counties may allow the expansion of small-scale businesses as long as those small-scale businesses conform with the rural character of the area as defined by the local government according to RCW 36.70A.030(23). Rural counties may also allow new small-scale businesses to utilize a site previously occupied by an existing business as long as the new small-scale business conforms to the rural character of the area as defined by the local government according to RCW 36.70A.030(23). Public services and public facilities shall be limited to those necessary to serve the isolated nonresidential use and shall be provided in a manner that does not permit low-density sprawl;

    iv. A county shall adopt measures to minimize and contain the existing areas or uses of more intensive rural development, as appropriate, authorized under this subsection. Lands included in such existing areas or uses shall not extend beyond the logical outer boundary of the existing area or use, thereby allowing a new pattern of low-density sprawl. Existing areas are those that are clearly identifiable and contained and where there is a logical boundary delineated predominately by the built environment, but that may also include undeveloped lands if limited as provided in this subsection. The county shall establish the logical outer boundary of an area of more intensive rural development. In establishing the logical outer boundary, the county shall address (A) the need to preserve the character of existing natural neighborhoods and communities, (B) physical boundaries, such as bodies of water, streets and highways, and land forms and contours, (C) the prevention of abnormally irregular boundaries, and (D) the ability to provide public facilities and public services in a manner that does not permit low-density sprawl;

<p>The legislature finds that restrictive covenants and agreements have historically been used to exclude people from communities based on their race, ethnicity, or religion. Even when this was not the intent, these restrictive covenants and agreements have resulted in discriminatory outcomes. In order to remove these barriers, and to promote more equitable and sustainable housing options, the legislature finds that it is necessary to apply policies that promote affordable, inclusive housing options in areas governed by restrictive covenants and agreements. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature that the policies in RCW 36.70A.070 providing for increased housing options apply throughout the state, notwithstanding restrictive covenants and agreements to the contrary.</p>
