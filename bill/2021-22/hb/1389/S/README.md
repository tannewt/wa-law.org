    d. A peer-to-peer car sharing program shall make certain that, during each car sharing period, the shared vehicle owner and the shared vehicle driver are insured under a motor vehicle liability insurance policy that provides insurance coverage in amounts no less than the minimum amounts provided in chapter 46.29 RCW, and:

        ii. The peer-to-peer car sharing program does not have available, did not retain, or fails to provide the information required by section 4 of this act.
