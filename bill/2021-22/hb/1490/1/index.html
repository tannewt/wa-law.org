<h2 id="section-1-56">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-56">¶</a></h2>
<p>(1) The legislature declares that access to energy undergirds Washington's economic resilience and public health outcomes. Energy is a crucial service that Washingtonians need in order to secure an education, participate in the economy, and stay safe and healthy.
(2) The legislature finds that during the COVID-19 crisis, access to energy, as protected by proclamations delivered by the governor and shut-off moratoria issued by the utilities and transportation commission, reduced COVID-19 infections by 4.4 percent and mortality rates by 7.4 percent. These protections are due to expire April 30, 2021, at which point many Washingtonians risk losing access to life-preserving energy services.
(3) It is therefore the intent of the legislature to strengthen Washington's economic resilience and public health outcomes by prohibiting utility service termination for residential electricity and heating due to nonpayment for low-income households and households with people with disabilities.</p>
