<h2 id="section-1-1917">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1917">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes that the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed the delivery of education across the state, as school districts transition to remote learning environments to protect the health of students and staff. The legislature also recognizes that state funding formulas are largely driven by enrollment and the pandemic has resulted in unforeseen, temporary enrollment declines in many districts. Funding declines due to temporary, unforeseen changes in enrollment can affect a district's ability to maintain the staffing and resources needed to deliver education services. With this act, the legislature intends to provide stabilizing funding to districts that have seen temporary enrollment declines due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-1511">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-1511">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction must provide an enrollment stabilization allocation to local education agencies equal to (a) minus (b) if (a) minus (b) is greater than zero:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Total federal funding that is available to the local education agency from subgrants provided by the elementary and secondary school emergency relief fund as enacted by section 313, the coronavirus response and relief supplemental appropriations act, P.L. 116-260, division M and other federal funds as described in subsection (7) of this section.</p>

<p>The maximum enrollment stabilization allocation for the 2020-21 school year is the amount needed to bring total allocations for all program and enrollment groups listed in (b) of this subsection that meet the criteria in (a) of this subsection up to an amount calculated using 2019-20 annual average enrollment values and formulas in place for the 2020-21 school year.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A program and enrollment group meets the criteria to be included in the maximum enrollment stabilization allocation for a local education agency if enrollment in the 2020-21 school year is less than funded annual average enrollment in the 2019-20 school year and using 2019-20 annual average enrollment values does not result in less funding within the program to the local education agency.</p>
