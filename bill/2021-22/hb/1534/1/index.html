<h2 id="section-1-1734">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1734">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature intends to create cost-effective climate policy that recognizes the special nature of energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries. The legislature further intends to encourage these industries to continue to innovate, find new ways to be more energy efficient, use lower carbon products, and be positioned to be global leaders in a low carbon economy, while also recognizing that overly burdensome regulation or taxation could result in perverse consequences and potentially increase overall carbon pollution.</p>
<p>An economy-wide carbon tax is one of the most cost-effective methods to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but may have unintended consequences in certain sectors. To mitigate these impacts this act will, in tandem with chapter . . ., Laws of 2021 (House Bill No. 1513), create incentives to reduce carbon pollution while recognizing the unique nature of energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-1363">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-1363">¶</a></h2>
<p>The definitions in section 2, chapter . . ., Laws of 2021 (House Bill No. 1513) and this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&quot;Department&quot; means the department of revenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;EITE facility&quot; means a manufacturing business that meets the criteria established by the department of commerce in section 5 of this act.</p>

<p>The carbon tax benefits account is created in the state treasury. All receipts from the tax levied and collected under section 4 of this act on fossil fuels consumed by EITE facilities must be deposited into the account. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Expenditures from the account may only be used for the purposes of implementing the working families tax exemption established in RCW 82.08.0206 and for workforce transition investments.</p>

<li>
<p>Beginning July 1, 2022, a carbon pollution tax is imposed on the sale or use within this state of all fossil fuels by EITE facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The measure of the carbon pollution tax is the carbon dioxide equivalent emissions:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Resulting from the complete combustion or oxidation of fossil fuels sold or used by the EITE facility within this state; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the entire life cycle of the fossil fuel.</p>

<li>
<p>The tax rate as of July 1, 2022, is equal to $25 per metric ton of greenhouse gas emissions. The department and EITE facilities must measure greenhouse gas emissions for each type and unit of fossil fuel consistent with subsection (3) of this section. The tax rate annually increases automatically each July 1st thereafter by five percent, and is adjusted for inflation using the consumer price index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As of January 1, 2030, if the department of ecology, based on data collected by the department on total fuels subject to the tax in (a) of this subsection in the previous year, determines that the sources of emissions covered by the tax are not predicted to achieve their combined share of the emissions reductions necessary for the state to achieve the emissions limits established in RCW 70A.45.020, the tax rate established in (a) of this subsection must increase by $10 beginning July 1, 2031. Each year thereafter, the tax rate must continue to increase by five percent each year plus inflation, with an additional annual increase of $2 each year until the department of ecology determines that the sources of emissions covered by the tax are expected to meet the limits established in RCW 70A.45.020, at which point the additional $2 per year increase is retired, and the annual rate of increase returns to five percent plus inflation. Every two years between the years 2030 and 2050, the department, in consultation with the department of ecology, must reevaluate the necessary tax rate to ensure the state achieves a goal of net zero emissions by 2050. The department of ecology must make the determinations required under this subsection and notify the department by April 1st of each odd-numbered year. If the output adjusted emissions of an EITE facility meet the percentage reductions established in RCW 70A.45.020 as compared to 1990 average output adjusted emissions, then the additional annual increases are not applied to that EITE facility.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must determine the tax in each case by applying a carbon calculation using methodologies adopted by the department of ecology as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>For any fuels used to refine fossil fuels by an EITE facility, the department of ecology must adopt by rule criteria for making the carbon calculation in consultation with the department. The department of ecology must consider, among other information, the reports filed under section 11 of this act. Among other resources, the department of ecology must consider greenhouse gas content measurements for fossil fuels from the United States energy information administration or the United States environmental protection agency;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For all other fuels sold or used in Washington by an EITE facility, the department of ecology, in consultation with the department, must adopt by rule criteria for making the carbon calculation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of ecology may require additional information from sources as necessary, in consultation with the department of commerce, for determining the carbon calculation under this chapter.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Upon the first EITE facility within this state upon which the tax would be applicable, for fossil fuels sold by one EITE facility to another EITE facility;</p>

<p>Until July 1, 2030, a credit may be taken against the tax imposed under section 4 of this act in an amount equal to the amount of the tax attributable to 70 percent of an EITE facility's greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 plus any amounts specified in section 7 of this act, determined as provided in this section. For new EITE facilities that begin activities after January 1, 2020, but before January 1, 2030, or if presumptive emissions calculations are available before 2030 and larger than 2019 emissions, the facility may take a credit equal to 70 percent of the EITE facility's presumptive greenhouse gas emissions plus any amounts specified in section 7 of this act, as determined by the department of ecology, or emissions for the most recent year for which actual greenhouse gas emissions are available. The purpose of the credit is to mitigate the risk of leakage of emissions from within the state to instead occur beyond the borders of the state, to support the competitiveness of the state's energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries, and to provide assistance to such businesses to achieve greater energy efficiency and implement lower carbon manufacturing processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning July 1, 2030, the department must adjust the amount of credit that may be claimed by each EITE facility so that the EITE facility may claim any amounts specified in section 7 of this act plus credits to offset 70 percent of the lesser of either:</p>
