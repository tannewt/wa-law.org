No more than 20 percent of the total combined mass of an alternative energy facility may enter into a landfill as part of the grantee's decommissioning plan. For the purpose of determining the total combined mass under this subsection, the total combined mass includes wind turbines, solar photovoltaic modules, wind turbine blades, meteorological towers, guy wires, auxiliary equipment, and steel support structures. Cement support structures may not be considered when determining the total combined mass under this subsection; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The financial assurance specified under section 3 of this act.</p>

<h2 id="section-5-697">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5-697">¶</a></h2>
<p>The regulation of the decommissioning of alternative energy facilities is a matter of general statewide interest that requires uniform statewide regulation. This chapter and the rules adopted under this chapter constitute a comprehensive plan with respect to all aspects of alternative energy facility agreements, financial assurance, and decommissioning plans associated with alternative energy facilities within this state. Any county, municipal, or other local government ordinance or regulation that materially impedes the purposes of this chapter is preempted and is without force and effect.</p>
