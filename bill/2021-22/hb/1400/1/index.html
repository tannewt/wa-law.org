<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that there are many ways to gain demonstrated competency of skills in a profession. Furthermore, conditions such as educational requirements, course fees, and training hours, which an individual must fulfill before receiving a professional license to practice in a profession, create unnecessary barriers to an individual's right to employment if the individual can demonstrate full competency of the skills required of that profession.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that such redundant requirements are likely to discriminate against people of color, low-income individuals, and trained or untrained immigrant populations, who may possess the ability to excel in a profession but lack the ability to readily fulfill the professional licensing requirements to practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is therefore the intent of the legislature to authorize the Washington state department of licensing, after consulting with relevant trade groups, to develop a competency-based assessment which allows individuals to demonstrate proficiency of the knowledge and skills otherwise required by a professional licensing examination.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2-1998">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-1998">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This section adds a new section to an existing chapter <a href="/rcw/43_state_government%E2%80%94executive/43.024_department_of_licensing.html">43.24</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/43_state_government%E2%80%94executive/43.024_department_of_licensing.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>

<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>&quot;Competency-based licensing requirement&quot; means a practical assessment of knowledge and skills that clearly demonstrate a person is prepared to engage in a profession regulated by the department, and which the director of the department of licensing determines is at least as effective as examination-based professional licensing requirements at demonstrating proficiency and protecting the health and safety of the public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Competency-based licensing requirement&quot; may include, but is not limited to, any combination of training, experience, testing, or observation.</p>
