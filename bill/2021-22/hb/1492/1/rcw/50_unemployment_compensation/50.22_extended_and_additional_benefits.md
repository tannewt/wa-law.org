7. No provisions of this title which terminates a disqualification for voluntarily leaving employment, being discharged for misconduct, or refusing suitable employment shall apply for purposes of determining eligibility for extended compensation unless such termination is based upon employment subsequent to the date of such disqualification.

8. The provisions of subsections (1) through (7) of this section shall apply with respect to weeks of unemployment beginning after March 31, 1981: PROVIDED HOWEVER, That the provisions of subsections (1) through (7) of this section shall not apply to those weeks of unemployment beginning after March 6, 1993, and before January 1, 1995.

## 50.22.130 - Training benefits program—Intent.
It is the intent of the legislature that a training benefits program be established to provide unemployment insurance benefits to unemployed individuals who participate in training programs necessary for their reemployment.

The legislature further intends that this program serve the following goals:

1. Retraining should be available for those unemployed individuals whose skills are no longer in demand;

2. Training must enhance the individual's marketable skills and earning power; and

3. Retraining must be targeted to high-demand occupations.

The legislature further intends that funding for this program be limited by a specified maximum amount each fiscal year.
