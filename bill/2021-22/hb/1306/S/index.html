<p>The legislature finds that local school district boards of directors have the authority to put capital bond votes before their voters, but often lack the basic understanding of legal requirements related to public works projects. Better informed school boards of directors are likely to take greater responsibility in selecting responsible contractors and enforcing public works legal obligations. Better understanding of public works obligations and opportunities may lead to lower overall project costs, more money retained locally, and opportunities to develop a workforce pipeline for family-wage jobs and careers within the community.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-1435">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-1435">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This section adds a new section to an existing chapter <a href="/rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.525_bond_issues.html">28A.525</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.525_bond_issues.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Prior to approving a bond authorization for voter consideration, any member of a school district board of directors voting to approve that bond authorization must have received training on basic legal requirements and opportunities of public sector capital projects. Any member of a school district board of directors voting to approve a bond authorization for voter consideration must have received the training required by this section in the six-year period preceding their vote. This training must include, but is not limited to:</p>

</li>
<li>
