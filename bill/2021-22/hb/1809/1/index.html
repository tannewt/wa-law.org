<p>The legislature finds and declares that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The existence of accessible and affordable health care services that are responsive to the needs of the community is an important public policy goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic laid bare both the crucial importance of our health care systems and the inequities that exist and exacerbate harm to marginalized communities, including in access to and delivery of affordable, quality care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health entity mergers, acquisitions, and contracting affiliations impact cost, quality, and access to health care, and affect working conditions and employee benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health entity mergers, acquisitions, and contracting affiliations have been shown to result in anticompetitive consequences, including higher prices and a lack of any meaningful choice among health care providers within a community or geographic region. These negative outcomes are exacerbated for those in rural areas with few health care providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature is committed to ensuring that Washingtonians have access to the full range of reproductive, end-of-life, and gender affirming health care services. Yet, Washingtonians continue to experience difficulty accessing gender affirming care, and health entity mergers and acquisitions in Washington state have resulted in material reductions in reproductive and end-of-life health care services, to the detriment of communities and patients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health entity mergers, acquisitions, and contracting affiliations must improve rather than harm access to affordable quality health care.</p>
</li>

<ol>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to ensure that competition beneficial to consumers in health care markets across Washington remains vigorous and robust <strong>and that health care be affordable and accessible</strong>. The legislature supports <strong>these intents</strong> through this chapter, which provides the attorney general with notice of all material health care transactions in this state so that the attorney general has the information necessary to determine whether an investigation under the consumer protection act is warranted for potential anticompetitive conduct and consumer harm. This chapter is intended to supplement the federal Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust improvements act, Title 15 U.S.C. Sec. 18a, by requiring notice of transactions not reportable under Hart-Scott-Rodino reporting thresholds and by providing the attorney general with a copy of any filings made pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino act. <strong>In addition to ensuring vigorous and robust competition in health care markets, this chapter is also intended to ensure material change transactions result in the affected communities having the same or greater access to quality, affordable care, including emergency care, primary care, reproductive care, end-of-life care including services provided in accordance with chapter 70.245 RCW, and gender affirming care.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Notwithstanding the language in this chapter regarding the attorney general's authority to determine the effect of a material change transaction on access to care, nothing in this chapter is intended to derogate from or otherwise affect in any way the attorney general's authority to conduct an investigation, or the process of any investigation, under chapter 19.86 RCW. Nothing in this section is intended to change or affect in any way any substantive law regarding the antitrust analysis of a material change transaction.</strong></p>
