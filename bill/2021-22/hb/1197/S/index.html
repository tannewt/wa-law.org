<pre><code>b. If the health care provider seeking informed consent for proposed health care of the patient who has been placed under a guardianship under RCW 11.130.265 makes reasonable efforts to locate and secure authorization from a competent person in the first or succeeding class and finds no such person available, authorization may be given by any person in the next class in the order of descending priority.

    i. If a person of higher priority under this section has refused to give such authorization; or

    ii. If there are two or more individuals in the same class and the decision is not unanimous among all available members of that class.

c. Before any person authorized to provide informed consent on behalf of a patient who has been placed under a guardianship under RCW 11.130.265 exercises that authority, the person must first determine in good faith that that patient, if competent, would consent to the proposed health care. If such a determination cannot be made, the decision to consent to the proposed health care may be made only after determining that the proposed health care is in the patient's best interests.

d. No rights under Washington's death with dignity act, chapter 70.245 RCW, may be exercised through a person authorized to provide informed consent to health care on behalf of a patient who is a minor or has been placed under a guardianship under RCW 11.130.265.

e. **A person may revoke a designation made pursuant to (a)(iii) of this subsection at any time by personally informing any person providing care to the patient of the patient's intent to revoke the designation, which revocation shall be documented in the patient's health record. A health care provider that relies upon the consent of an individual designated pursuant to (a)(iii) of this subsection in order to provide care to a patient is immune from suit in any action, civil or criminal, or from professional or other disciplinary action for relying upon such consent unless the health care provider had actual knowledge of the patient's revocation of that designation at the time consent was obtained.**
