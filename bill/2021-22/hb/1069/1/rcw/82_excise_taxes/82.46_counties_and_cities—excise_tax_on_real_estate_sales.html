<p>Any taxes imposed under this chapter or RCW 82.46.070 shall be paid to and collected by the treasurer of the county within which is located the real property which was sold. The treasurer shall act as agent for any city within the county imposing the tax.

A receipt issued by the county treasurer for the payment of the tax imposed under this chapter or RCW 82.46.070 shall be evidence of the satisfaction of the lien imposed in RCW 82.46.040 and may be recorded in the manner prescribed for recording satisfactions of mortgages. No instrument of sale or conveyance evidencing a sale subject to the tax may be accepted by the county auditor for filing or recording until the tax is paid and the stamp affixed thereto; in case the tax is not due on the transfer, the instrument shall not be accepted until suitable notation of this fact is made on the instrument by the treasurer.</p>
