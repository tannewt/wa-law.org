<p>The conveyances must be by quitclaim deed, or other form of conveyance, executed by the secretary of transportation, and must expressly restrict the use of the property to a mitigation site consistent with preservation of the functions and values of the site, and must provide for the automatic reversion to the department if the property is not used as a mitigation site or is not maintained in a manner that complies with applicable permits, laws, and regulations pertaining to the maintenance and operation of the mitigation site.</p>
