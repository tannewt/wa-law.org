<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>To get a representative sample of recycling programs in the state, the department shall conduct and publish on its website a characterization study of material types and forms that are collected, sorted, sold, or transferred by facilities that process recyclable materials from curbside recycling programs and other solid waste facilities deemed appropriate by the department for inclusion in the study.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The material characterization study must:</p>
<ol type="i">
