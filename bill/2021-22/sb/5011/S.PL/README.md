## Section 7
> This section modifies existing section [64.34.352](/rcw/64_real_property_and_conveyances/64.34_condominium_act.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/64_real_property_and_conveyances/64.34_condominium_act.md) for context.

1. Commencing not later than the time of the first conveyance of a unit to a person other than a declarant, the association shall maintain, to the extent reasonably available:

    a. Property insurance on the condominium, which may, but need not, include equipment, improvements, and betterments in a unit installed by the declarant or the unit owners, insuring against all risks of direct physical loss commonly insured against. The total amount of insurance after application of any deductibles shall be not less than eighty percent, or such greater amount specified in the declaration, of the actual cash value of the insured property at the time the insurance is purchased and at each renewal date, exclusive of land, excavations, foundations, and other items normally excluded from property policies; and

    b. Liability insurance, including medical payments insurance, in an amount determined by the board of directors but not less than the amount specified in the declaration, covering all occurrences commonly insured against for death, bodily injury, and property damage arising out of or in connection with the use, ownership, or maintenance of the common elements.

2. If the insurance described in subsection (1) of this section is not reasonably available, or is modified, canceled, or not renewed, the association promptly shall cause notice of that fact to be **provided to each unit owner in accordance with this chapter and** hand-delivered or sent prepaid by first-class United States mail  to each eligible mortgagee and to each mortgagee to whom a certificate or memorandum of insurance has been issued at their respective last known addresses. The declaration may require the association to carry any other insurance, and the association in any event may carry any other insurance it deems appropriate to protect the association or the unit owners.

3. Insurance policies carried pursuant to subsection (1) of this section shall provide that:

    a. Each unit owner is an insured person under the policy with respect to liability arising out of the owner's interest in the common elements or membership in the association;

    b. The insurer waives its right to subrogation under the policy against any unit owner, member of the owner's household, and lessee of the owner;

    c. No act or omission by any unit owner, unless acting within the scope of the owner's authority on behalf of the association, will void the policy or be a condition to recovery under the policy; and

    d. If, at the time of a loss under the policy, there is other insurance in the name of a unit owner covering the same risk covered by the policy, the association's policy provides primary insurance.

4. Any loss covered by the property insurance under subsection (1)(a) of this section must be adjusted with the association, but the insurance proceeds for that loss are payable to any insurance trustee designated for that purpose, or otherwise to the association, and not to any holder of a mortgage. The insurance trustee or the association shall hold any insurance proceeds in trust for unit owners and lienholders as their interests may appear. Subject to the provisions of subsection (7) of this section, the proceeds must be disbursed first for the repair or restoration of the damaged property, and unit owners and lienholders are not entitled to receive payment of any portion of the proceeds unless there is a surplus of proceeds after the property has been completely repaired or restored or the condominium is terminated.

5. An insurance policy issued to the association does not prevent a unit owner from obtaining insurance for the owner's own benefit.

6. An insurer that has issued an insurance policy under this section shall issue certificates or memoranda of insurance to the association and, upon written request, to any unit owner or holder of a mortgage. The insurer issuing the policy may not modify the amount or the extent of the coverage of the policy or cancel or refuse to renew the policy unless the insurer has complied with all applicable provisions of chapter 48.18 RCW pertaining to the cancellation or nonrenewal of contracts of insurance. The insurer shall not modify the amount or the extent of the coverage of the policy, or cancel or refuse to renew the policy without complying with this section.

7. Any portion of the condominium for which insurance is required under this section which is damaged or destroyed shall be repaired or replaced promptly by the association unless: (a) The condominium is terminated; (b) repair or replacement would be illegal under any state or local health or safety statute or ordinance; or (c) eighty percent of the unit owners, including every owner of a unit or assigned limited common element which will not be rebuilt, vote not to rebuild. The cost of repair or replacement in excess of insurance proceeds and reserves is a common expense. If all of the damaged or destroyed portions of the condominium are not repaired or replaced: (i) The insurance proceeds attributable to the damaged common elements shall be used to restore the damaged area to a condition compatible with the remainder of the condominium; (ii) the insurance proceeds attributable to units and limited common elements which are not rebuilt shall be distributed to the owners of those units and the owners of the units to which those limited common elements were allocated, or to lienholders, as their interests may appear; and (iii) the remainder of the proceeds shall be distributed to all the unit owners or lienholders, as their interests may appear, in proportion to the common element interests of all the units. If the unit owners vote not to rebuild any unit, that unit's allocated interests are automatically reallocated upon the vote as if the unit had been condemned under RCW 64.34.060(1), and the association promptly shall prepare, execute, and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, RCW 64.34.268 governs the distribution of insurance proceeds if the condominium is terminated.

8. The provisions of this section may be varied or waived as provided in the declaration if all units of a condominium are restricted to nonresidential use.


## Section 10
> This section modifies existing section [64.38.035](/rcw/64_real_property_and_conveyances/64.38_homeowners_associations.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/64_real_property_and_conveyances/64.38_homeowners_associations.md) for context.

Special meetings of the association may be called by the president, a majority of the board of directors, or by owners having ten percent of the votes in the association. The association must make available to each owner of record for examination and copying minutes from the previous association meeting not more than sixty days after the meeting. Minutes of the previous association meeting must be approved at the next association meeting in accordance with the association's governing documents.

2. Not less than fourteen nor more than **fifty** days in advance of any meeting of the association, the secretary or other officers specified in the bylaws shall **cause** notice **of the meeting to be provided** to each owner

**in accordance with this chapter**.

3. The notice of any meeting shall state the time and place of the meeting and the business to be placed on the agenda by the board of directors for a vote by the owners, including the general nature of any proposed amendment to the articles of incorporation, bylaws, any budget or changes in the previously approved budget that result in a change in assessment obligation, and any proposal to remove a director.

4. Except as provided in this subsection, all meetings of the board of directors shall be open for observation by all owners of record and their authorized agents. The board of directors shall keep minutes of all actions taken by the board, which shall be available to all owners. Upon the affirmative vote in open meeting to assemble in closed session, the board of directors may convene in closed executive session to consider personnel matters; consult with legal counsel or consider communications with legal counsel; and discuss likely or pending litigation, matters involving possible violations of the governing documents of the association, and matters involving the possible liability of an owner to the association. The motion shall state specifically the purpose for the closed session. Reference to the motion and the stated purpose for the closed session shall be included in the minutes. The board of directors shall restrict the consideration of matters during the closed portions of meetings only to those purposes specifically exempted and stated in the motion. No motion, or other action adopted, passed, or agreed to in closed session may become effective unless the board of directors, following the closed session, reconvenes in open meeting and votes in the open meeting on such motion, or other action which is reasonably identified. The requirements of this subsection shall not require the disclosure of information in violation of law or which is otherwise exempt from disclosure.

5. **Except as otherwise restricted by the governing documents, meetings of the association may be conducted by telephonic, video, or other conferencing process, if: (a) The meeting notice states the conferencing process to be used and provides information explaining how owners may participate in the conference directly or by meeting at a central location or conference connection; and (b) the process provides all owners the opportunity to hear or perceive the discussion and to comment.**


## Section 13
> This section modifies existing section [64.90.445](/rcw/64_real_property_and_conveyances/64.90_washington_uniform_common_interest_ownership_act.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/64_real_property_and_conveyances/64.90_washington_uniform_common_interest_ownership_act.md) for context.

1. The following requirements apply to unit owner meetings:

    a. A meeting of the association must be held at least once each year. Failure to hold an annual meeting does not cause a forfeiture or give cause for dissolution of the association and does not affect otherwise valid association acts.

    b. [Empty]

        i. An association must hold a special meeting of unit owners to address any matter affecting the common interest community or the association if its president, a majority of the board, or unit owners having at least twenty percent, or any lower percentage specified in the organizational documents, of the votes in the association request that the secretary call the meeting.

        ii. If the association does not provide notice to unit owners of a special meeting within thirty days after the requisite number or percentage of unit owners request the secretary to do so, the requesting members may directly provide notice to all the unit owners of the meeting. Only matters described in the meeting notice required in (c) of this subsection may be considered at a special meeting.

    c. An association must provide notice to unit owners of the time, date, and place of each annual and special unit owners meeting not less than fourteen days and not more than fifty days before the meeting date. Notice may be by any means described in RCW 64.90.515. The notice of any meeting must state the time, date, and place of the meeting and the items on the agenda, including:

        i. The text of any proposed amendment to the declaration or organizational documents;

        ii. Any changes in the previously approved budget that result in a change in the assessment obligations; and

    e. Unit owners must be given a reasonable opportunity at any meeting to comment regarding any matter affecting the common interest community or the association.

    f. **Except as otherwise restricted by the** declaration or organizational documents **,** meetings of unit owners **may** be conducted by telephonic, video, or other conferencing process, if the process is consistent with subsection (2)(i) of this section.

2. The following requirements apply to meetings of the board and committees authorized to act for the board:

    a. Meetings must be open to the unit owners except during executive sessions, but the board may expel or prohibit attendance by any person who, after warning by the chair of the meeting, disrupts the meeting. The board and those committees may hold an executive session only during a regular or special meeting of the board or a committee. A final vote or action may not be taken during an executive session.

    b. An executive session may be held only to:

        i. Consult with the association's attorney concerning legal matters;

        ii. Discuss existing or potential litigation or mediation, arbitration, or administrative proceedings;

        iii. Discuss labor or personnel matters;

        iv. Discuss contracts, leases, and other commercial transactions to purchase or provide goods or services currently being negotiated, including the review of bids or proposals, if premature general knowledge of those matters would place the association at a disadvantage; or

    v. Prevent public knowledge of the matter to be discussed if the board or committee determines that public knowledge would violate the privacy of any person.

    c. For purposes of this subsection, a gathering of members of the board or committees at which the board or committee members do not conduct association business is not a meeting of the board or committee. Board members and committee members may not use incidental or social gatherings to evade the open meeting requirements of this subsection.

    d. During the period of declarant control, the board must meet at least four times a year. At least one of those meetings must be held at the common interest community or at a place convenient to the community. After the transition meeting, all board meetings must be at the common interest community or at a place convenient to the common interest community unless the unit owners amend the bylaws to vary the location of those meetings.

    e. At each board meeting, the board must provide a reasonable opportunity for unit owners to comment regarding matters affecting the common interest community and the association.

    f. Unless the meeting is included in a schedule given to the unit owners or the meeting is called to deal with an emergency, the secretary or other officer specified in the organizational documents must provide notice of each board meeting to each board member and to the unit owners. The notice must be given at least fourteen days before the meeting and must state the time, date, place, and agenda of the meeting.

    g. If any materials are distributed to the board before the meeting, the board must make copies of those materials reasonably available to the unit owners, except that the board need not make available copies of unapproved minutes or materials that are to be considered in executive session.

    h. Unless the organizational documents provide otherwise, fewer than all board members may participate in a regular or special meeting by or conduct a meeting through the use of any means of communication by which all board members participating can hear each other during the meeting. A board member participating in a meeting by these means is deemed to be present in person at the meeting.

    i. Unless the organizational documents provide otherwise, the board may meet by participation of all board members by telephonic, video, or other conferencing process if:

        i. The meeting notice states the conferencing process to be used and provides information explaining how unit owners may participate in the conference directly or by meeting at a central location or conference connection; and

        ii. The process provides all unit owners the opportunity to hear or perceive the discussion and to comment as provided in (e) of this subsection.

    j. After the transition meeting, unit owners may amend the organizational documents to vary the procedures for meetings described in (i) of this subsection.

    k. Instead of meeting, the board may act by unanimous consent as documented in a record by all its members. Actions taken by unanimous consent must be kept as a record of the association with the meeting minutes. After the transition meeting, the board may act by unanimous consent only to undertake ministerial actions, actions subject to ratification by the unit owners, or to implement actions previously taken at a meeting of the board.

    l. A board member who is present at a board meeting at which any action is taken is presumed to have assented to the action taken unless the board member's dissent or abstention to such action is lodged with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting before adjournment of the meeting or provided in a record to the secretary of the association immediately after adjournment of the meeting. The right to dissent or abstain does not apply to a board member who voted in favor of such action at the meeting.

    m. A board member may not vote by proxy or absentee ballot.

    n. Even if an action by the board is not in compliance with this section, it is valid unless set aside by a court. A challenge to the validity of an action of the board for failure to comply with this section may not be brought more than ninety days after the minutes of the board of the meeting at which the action was taken are approved or the record of that action is distributed to unit owners, whichever is later.

3. Minutes of all unit owner meetings and board meetings, excluding executive sessions, must be maintained in a record. The decision on each matter voted upon at a board meeting or unit owner meeting must be recorded in the minutes.
