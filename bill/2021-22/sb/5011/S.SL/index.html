<li>
<p>The consent of any apartment owner is revoked if the association is unable to electronically transmit two consecutive notices and this inability becomes known to the secretary of the association of apartment owners or any other person responsible for giving the notice. The inadvertent failure by the association of apartment owners to treat this inability as a revocation does not invalidate any meeting or other action.</p>
</li>

<p>Apartment owners may vote at a meeting in person, by absentee ballot pursuant to subsection (3)(d) of this section, or by a proxy pursuant to subsection (5) of this section.</p>

<p>Apartment owners or their proxies who are present in person may vote by voice vote, show of hands, standing, written ballot, or any other method for determining the votes of apartment owners, as designated by the person presiding at the meeting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If only one of several apartment owners of an apartment is present, that apartment owner is entitled to cast all the votes allocated to that apartment. If more than one of the apartment owners are present, the votes allocated to that apartment may be cast only in accordance with the agreement of a majority in interest of the apartment owners, unless the declaration expressly provides otherwise. There is a majority agreement if any one of the apartment owners casts the votes allocated to the apartment without protest being made promptly to the person presiding over the meeting by any of the other apartment owners of the apartment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless a greater number or fraction of the votes in the association is required under this chapter or the declaration or organizational documents, a majority of the votes cast determines the outcome of any action of the association.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever proposals or board members are to be voted upon at a meeting, an apartment owner may vote by duly executed absentee ballot if:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>A ballot is provided by the association for such purpose.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>When an apartment owner votes by absentee ballot, the association must be able to verify that the ballot is cast by the apartment owner having the right to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided otherwise in the declaration or organizational documents, the following requirements apply with respect to proxy voting:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Votes allocated to an apartment may be cast pursuant to a directed or undirected proxy duly executed by an apartment owner in the same manner as provided in RCW 24.06.110.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>An apartment owner may revoke a proxy given pursuant to this section only by actual notice of revocation to the secretary or the person presiding over a meeting of the association or by delivery of a subsequent proxy. The death or disability of an apartment owner does not revoke a proxy given by the apartment owner unless the person presiding over the meeting has actual notice of the death or disability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A proxy is void if it is not dated or purports to be revocable without notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless stated otherwise in the proxy, a proxy terminates eleven months after its date of issuance.</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The association must deliver a ballot to every apartment owner with the notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ballot must set forth each proposed action and provide an opportunity to vote for or against the action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A ballot cast pursuant to this section may be revoked only by actual notice to the association of revocation. The death or disability of an apartment owner does not revoke a ballot unless the association has actual notice of the death or disability prior to the date set forth in (b)(i) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Approval by ballot pursuant to this subsection is valid only if the number of votes cast by ballot equals or exceeds the quorum required to be present at a meeting authorizing the action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the association does not receive a sufficient number of votes to constitute a quorum or to approve the proposal by the date and time established for return of ballots, the board of directors may extend the deadline for a reasonable period not to exceed eleven months upon further notice to all members in accordance with (b) of this subsection. In that event, all votes previously cast on the proposal must be counted unless subsequently revoked as provided in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A ballot or revocation is not effective until received by the association.</p>

<li>
<p>If the governing documents require that votes on specified matters affecting the common interest community be cast by lessees rather than apartment owners of leased apartments:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>This section applies to lessees as if they were apartment owners;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apartment owners that have leased their apartments to other persons may not cast votes on those specified matters; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lessees are entitled to notice of meetings, access to records, and other rights respecting those matters as if they were apartment owners.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apartment owners must also be given notice, in the manner provided in section 2 of this act, of all meetings at which lessees may be entitled to vote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In any vote of the apartment owners, votes allocated to an apartment owned by the association must be cast in the same proportion as the votes cast on the matter by apartment owners other than the association.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as otherwise restricted by the declaration, bylaws, or articles of incorporation, meetings of apartment owners may be conducted by telephonic, video, or other conferencing process, if: (a) The meeting notice states the conferencing process to be used and provides information explaining how apartment owners may participate in the conference directly or by meeting at a central location or conference connection; and (b) the process provides all apartment owners the opportunity to hear or perceive the discussion and to comment.</p>

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Commencing not later than the time of the first conveyance of a unit to a person other than a declarant, the association shall maintain, to the extent reasonably available:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Property insurance on the condominium, which may, but need not, include equipment, improvements, and betterments in a unit installed by the declarant or the unit owners, insuring against all risks of direct physical loss commonly insured against. The total amount of insurance after application of any deductibles shall be not less than eighty percent, or such greater amount specified in the declaration, of the actual cash value of the insured property at the time the insurance is purchased and at each renewal date, exclusive of land, excavations, foundations, and other items normally excluded from property policies; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liability insurance, including medical payments insurance, in an amount determined by the board of directors but not less than the amount specified in the declaration, covering all occurrences commonly insured against for death, bodily injury, and property damage arising out of or in connection with the use, ownership, or maintenance of the common elements.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the insurance described in subsection (1) of this section is not reasonably available, or is modified, canceled, or not renewed, the association promptly shall cause notice of that fact to be <strong>provided to each unit owner in accordance with this chapter and</strong> hand-delivered or sent prepaid by first-class United States mail  to each eligible mortgagee and to each mortgagee to whom a certificate or memorandum of insurance has been issued at their respective last known addresses. The declaration may require the association to carry any other insurance, and the association in any event may carry any other insurance it deems appropriate to protect the association or the unit owners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insurance policies carried pursuant to subsection (1) of this section shall provide that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Each unit owner is an insured person under the policy with respect to liability arising out of the owner's interest in the common elements or membership in the association;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The insurer waives its right to subrogation under the policy against any unit owner, member of the owner's household, and lessee of the owner;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No act or omission by any unit owner, unless acting within the scope of the owner's authority on behalf of the association, will void the policy or be a condition to recovery under the policy; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If, at the time of a loss under the policy, there is other insurance in the name of a unit owner covering the same risk covered by the policy, the association's policy provides primary insurance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any loss covered by the property insurance under subsection (1)(a) of this section must be adjusted with the association, but the insurance proceeds for that loss are payable to any insurance trustee designated for that purpose, or otherwise to the association, and not to any holder of a mortgage. The insurance trustee or the association shall hold any insurance proceeds in trust for unit owners and lienholders as their interests may appear. Subject to the provisions of subsection (7) of this section, the proceeds must be disbursed first for the repair or restoration of the damaged property, and unit owners and lienholders are not entitled to receive payment of any portion of the proceeds unless there is a surplus of proceeds after the property has been completely repaired or restored or the condominium is terminated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An insurance policy issued to the association does not prevent a unit owner from obtaining insurance for the owner's own benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An insurer that has issued an insurance policy under this section shall issue certificates or memoranda of insurance to the association and, upon written request, to any unit owner or holder of a mortgage. The insurer issuing the policy may not modify the amount or the extent of the coverage of the policy or cancel or refuse to renew the policy unless the insurer has complied with all applicable provisions of chapter 48.18 RCW pertaining to the cancellation or nonrenewal of contracts of insurance. The insurer shall not modify the amount or the extent of the coverage of the policy, or cancel or refuse to renew the policy without complying with this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any portion of the condominium for which insurance is required under this section which is damaged or destroyed shall be repaired or replaced promptly by the association unless: (a) The condominium is terminated; (b) repair or replacement would be illegal under any state or local health or safety statute or ordinance; or (c) eighty percent of the unit owners, including every owner of a unit or assigned limited common element which will not be rebuilt, vote not to rebuild. The cost of repair or replacement in excess of insurance proceeds and reserves is a common expense. If all of the damaged or destroyed portions of the condominium are not repaired or replaced: (i) The insurance proceeds attributable to the damaged common elements shall be used to restore the damaged area to a condition compatible with the remainder of the condominium; (ii) the insurance proceeds attributable to units and limited common elements which are not rebuilt shall be distributed to the owners of those units and the owners of the units to which those limited common elements were allocated, or to lienholders, as their interests may appear; and (iii) the remainder of the proceeds shall be distributed to all the unit owners or lienholders, as their interests may appear, in proportion to the common element interests of all the units. If the unit owners vote not to rebuild any unit, that unit's allocated interests are automatically reallocated upon the vote as if the unit had been condemned under RCW 64.34.060(1), and the association promptly shall prepare, execute, and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, RCW 64.34.268 governs the distribution of insurance proceeds if the condominium is terminated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provisions of this section may be varied or waived as provided in the declaration if all units of a condominium are restricted to nonresidential use.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The association must deliver a ballot to every owner with the notice.</p>

<li>
<p>Meetings must be open to the unit owners except during executive sessions, but the board may expel or prohibit attendance by any person who, after warning by the chair of the meeting, disrupts the meeting. The board and those committees may hold an executive session only during a regular or special meeting of the board or a committee. A final vote or action may not be taken during an executive session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An executive session may be held only to:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Consult with the association's attorney concerning legal matters;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discuss existing or potential litigation or mediation, arbitration, or administrative proceedings;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discuss labor or personnel matters;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discuss contracts, leases, and other commercial transactions to purchase or provide goods or services currently being negotiated, including the review of bids or proposals, if premature general knowledge of those matters would place the association at a disadvantage; or</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prevent public knowledge of the matter to be discussed if the board or committee determines that public knowledge would violate the privacy of any person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this subsection, a gathering of members of the board or committees at which the board or committee members do not conduct association business is not a meeting of the board or committee. Board members and committee members may not use incidental or social gatherings to evade the open meeting requirements of this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the period of declarant control, the board must meet at least four times a year. At least one of those meetings must be held at the common interest community or at a place convenient to the community. After the transition meeting, all board meetings must be at the common interest community or at a place convenient to the common interest community unless the unit owners amend the bylaws to vary the location of those meetings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At each board meeting, the board must provide a reasonable opportunity for unit owners to comment regarding matters affecting the common interest community and the association.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless the meeting is included in a schedule given to the unit owners or the meeting is called to deal with an emergency, the secretary or other officer specified in the organizational documents must provide notice of each board meeting to each board member and to the unit owners. The notice must be given at least fourteen days before the meeting and must state the time, date, place, and agenda of the meeting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any materials are distributed to the board before the meeting, the board must make copies of those materials reasonably available to the unit owners, except that the board need not make available copies of unapproved minutes or materials that are to be considered in executive session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless the organizational documents provide otherwise, fewer than all board members may participate in a regular or special meeting by or conduct a meeting through the use of any means of communication by which all board members participating can hear each other during the meeting. A board member participating in a meeting by these means is deemed to be present in person at the meeting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless the organizational documents provide otherwise, the board may meet by participation of all board members by telephonic, video, or other conferencing process if:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The meeting notice states the conferencing process to be used and provides information explaining how unit owners may participate in the conference directly or by meeting at a central location or conference connection; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process provides all unit owners the opportunity to hear or perceive the discussion and to comment as provided in (e) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the transition meeting, unit owners may amend the organizational documents to vary the procedures for meetings described in (i) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of meeting, the board may act by unanimous consent as documented in a record by all its members. Actions taken by unanimous consent must be kept as a record of the association with the meeting minutes. After the transition meeting, the board may act by unanimous consent only to undertake ministerial actions, actions subject to ratification by the unit owners, or to implement actions previously taken at a meeting of the board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A board member who is present at a board meeting at which any action is taken is presumed to have assented to the action taken unless the board member's dissent or abstention to such action is lodged with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting before adjournment of the meeting or provided in a record to the secretary of the association immediately after adjournment of the meeting. The right to dissent or abstain does not apply to a board member who voted in favor of such action at the meeting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A board member may not vote by proxy or absentee ballot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if an action by the board is not in compliance with this section, it is valid unless set aside by a court. A challenge to the validity of an action of the board for failure to comply with this section may not be brought more than ninety days after the minutes of the board of the meeting at which the action was taken are approved or the record of that action is distributed to unit owners, whichever is later.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minutes of all unit owner meetings and board meetings, excluding executive sessions, must be maintained in a record. The decision on each matter voted upon at a board meeting or unit owner meeting must be recorded in the minutes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
