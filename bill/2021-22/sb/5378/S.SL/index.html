<p>All real estate brokers and managing brokers shall furnish proof as prescribed by rule of the director that they have successfully completed at least the required minimum number of <strong>30</strong> clock hours of instruction every two years in real estate courses approved by the director to renew their licenses.

Up to <strong>15</strong> clock hours of instruction in excess of the required <strong>30</strong> clock hours acquired within the immediately preceding two-year period may be carried forward for credit in a subsequent two-year period. Examinations shall not be required to fulfill any part of the education requirement in this section.</p>

However, active license renewal applicants who did not complete fair housing and consumer protection training as part of the instruction required by RCW 18.85.101 must complete six hours of the required 30 hours of instruction in subsection (1) of this section focused on fair housing education and prevention of unfair practices with respect to real estate transactions, facilities, or services as specified in RCW 49.60.222 only for the renewal cycle immediately following June 1, 2022.</strong></p>
