<p>A person may request a payment plan at any time for the payment of any monetary penalty, fee, cost, assessment, or other monetary obligation associated with a traffic infraction. The court shall enter into a payment plan with the individual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a court authorized community restitution program for offenders is available in the jurisdiction, the court may allow conversion of all or part of the monetary obligations due under this section to court authorized community restitution in lieu of time payments if the person is unable to make reasonable time payments.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The person may voluntarily pay an amount at any time in addition to the payments required under the payment plan.</p>

<p>If a payment required to be made under the payment plan is delinquent or the person fails to complete a community restitution program on or before the time established under the payment plan, unless the court determines good cause therefor and adjusts the payment plan or the community restitution plan accordingly, the court may refer the unpaid monetary penalty, fee, cost, assessment, or other monetary obligation for civil enforcement until all monetary obligations have been paid and court authorized community restitution has been completed, or until the court has entered into a new payment plan or community restitution agreement with the person.</p>

<li>
<p>Nothing in this section precludes a court from contracting with outside entities to administer its payment plan system.

<p>The court may modify a payment plan at any time.</p>
