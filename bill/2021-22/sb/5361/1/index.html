<p>Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, any offender sentenced for a violation of chapter 69.50 or 69.52 RCW that was committed prior to July 1, 2004, and who is serving a <strong>current sentence under custody of the department of corrections</strong> for that offense on June 11, 2020, is entitled to a resentencing hearing. The prosecuting attorney for the county in which any offender was sentenced and to whom this section applies must review the sentencing documents. If the offender is serving a term of incarceration for a violation of chapter 69.50 or 69.52 RCW that was committed prior to July 1, 2004, the prosecuting attorney shall, or the offender may, make a motion for relief from sentence to the original sentencing court.</p>

At resentencing, the court shall sentence the offender as if the offender had not previously been sentenced, provided the new sentence is <strong>based on current sentencing guidelines pursuant to RCW 9.94A.517 and does not result in a sentence that is longer than the high end of the standard range on the current drug sentencing grid</strong>.</p>
