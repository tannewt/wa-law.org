<p>It is the intent of the legislature to provide a dependable and systematic process for funding the benefits provided to members and retirees of the public employees' retirement system, chapter 41.40 RCW; the teachers' retirement system, chapter 41.32 RCW; the law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement systems, chapter 41.26 RCW; the school employees' retirement system, chapter 41.35 RCW; the public safety employees' retirement system, chapter 41.37 RCW; and the Washington state patrol retirement system, chapter 43.43 RCW.</p>
<p>The funding process established by this chapter is intended to achieve the following goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To fully fund the public employees' retirement system plans 2 and 3, the teachers' retirement system plans 2 and 3, the school employees' retirement system plans 2 and 3, the public safety employees' retirement system plan 2, and the law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system plan 2 as provided by law;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To fully amortize the total costs of the law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system plan 1, not later than June 30, 2024;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To fully amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liability in the public employees' retirement system plan 1 and the teachers' retirement system plan 1 within a rolling ten-year period, using methods and assumptions that balance needs for increased benefit security, decreased contribution rate volatility, and affordability of pension contribution rates;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To establish long-term employer contribution rates which will remain a relatively predictable proportion of the future state budgets; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To fund, to the extent feasible, all benefits for plan 2 and 3 members over the working lives of those members so that the cost of those benefits are paid by the taxpayers who receive the benefit of those members' service.</p>
</li>

<p>The basic employer and state contribution rates and required plan 2 member contribution rates are changed to reflect the 2003 actuarial valuation and actuarial projections of the 2005 actuarial valuation, both of which incorporate the 2002 actuarial experience study conducted by the office of the state actuary for 1995-2000. This contribution rate schedule departs from the normal biennial process for setting contribution rates by requiring annual increases in rates during the 2005-2007 biennium, and by requiring annual rates to be adopted by the pension funding council for the 2007-2009 biennium. The rates are lower in the 2005-2007 biennium than required by the 2003 actuarial valuation and will be higher in the 2007-2009 biennium than required by the projected 2005 actuarial valuation.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the 2005 actuarial valuation, the pension funding council and the state actuary shall review the appropriateness of the contribution rates for 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 and by September 30, 2006, the pension funding council shall adopt contribution rates to complete the four-year phase-in schedule, adjusted for any material changes in benefits or actuarial assumptions, methods, or experience. This contribution rate schedule also requires a departure from the allocation formula for contributions in RCW 41.45.050, suspension of payments on the unfunded liability in the public employees' retirement system and the teachers' retirement system during the 2005-2007 biennium, and a delay in the recognition of the cost of future gain-sharing benefits until the 2007-2009 biennium.</p>

<p>It is the intent of the legislature to provide for the systematic funding of the plan 1 unfunded accrued actuarial liabilities in a manner that promotes contribution rate adequacy and stability for the affected systems.

</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning September 1, 2006, a 1.29 percent contribution is established as part of the basic state and employer contribution rate for the teachers' retirement system, to be used for the sole purpose of amortizing the unfunded accrued actuarial liability in the teachers' retirement system plan 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning September 1, 2006, a 0.87 percent contribution is established as part of the basic state and employer contribution rate for the school employees' retirement system, to be used for the sole purpose of amortizing the unfunded accrued actuarial liability in the public employees' retirement system plan 1.</p>

<li>
<p>Beginning January 1, 2007, a 1.77 percent contribution is established as part of the basic state and employer contribution rate for the public employees' retirement system and the public safety employees' retirement system, to be used for the sole purpose of amortizing the unfunded accrued actuarial liability in the public employees' retirement system plan 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The contribution rates in this section shall be collected through June 30, 2007, for the public employees' retirement system and the public safety employees' retirement system and August 31, 2007, for the teachers' retirement system and the school employees' retirement system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon completion of the 2005 actuarial valuation, the pension funding council and the state actuary shall review the contribution rates for the plan 1 unfunded actuarial accrued liability for fiscal year 2008 and fiscal year 2009 and by September 30, 2006, the pension funding council shall adopt contribution rates to complete the three-year phase-in schedule, adjusted for any material changes in benefits or actuarial assumptions, methods, and experience. The expected present value of projected contributions during the three-year phase-in period shall be the same as the expected present value of projected contributions that would have been collected without the phase-in, as determined by the state actuary and adjusted for any material changes in benefits or actuarial assumptions, methods, or experience.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The allocation of costs between the employer and members of the Washington state patrol retirement system shall be made only after the application of any minimum total contribution rate that may be in effect for the system under subsection (4) of this section. For benefit improvements effective on or after July 1, 2007, costs shall be shared equally by members and the employer, and any cap on member contributions shall be adjusted accordingly. The member contribution rate shall be based on the adjusted total contribution rate described in subsection (2) of this section. Beginning July 1, 2007, the required member contribution rate for members of the Washington state patrol retirement system shall be the lesser of the following: (a) One-half of the adjusted total contribution rate for the system; or (b) seven percent, plus fifty percent of the contribution rate increase caused by any benefit improvements effective on or after July 1, 2007.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The employer shall continue to pay for all costs attributable to distributions under RCW 43.43.270(2) for survivors of members who became disabled under RCW 43.43.040(2) prior to July 1, 2006, until such costs are fully paid. In order to avoid charging members for these costs, the total required contribution rate shall be adjusted to exclude these costs. The result of the adjustment shall be the adjusted total contribution rate that is to be used to calculate the required member contribution rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The employer rate shall be the contribution rate required to cover all total system costs that are not covered by the member contribution rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning July 1, 2009, a minimum total contribution rate is established for the Washington state patrol retirement system. The total Washington state patrol retirement system contribution rate may exceed, but may not drop below, the established minimum total contribution rate. From July 1, 2009, through June 30, 2011, the minimum total contribution rate shall equal the total contribution rate required to fund fifty percent of the Washington state patrol retirement system's normal cost as calculated under the entry age normal cost method. Beginning July 1, 2011, the minimum total contribution rate shall equal the total contribution rate required to fund seventy percent of the Washington state patrol retirement system's normal cost as calculated under the entry age normal cost method. This minimum rate, when applicable, shall be collected in addition to any contribution rate required to amortize any unfunded costs attributable to distributions under RCW 43.43.270(2) for survivors of members who became disabled under RCW 43.43.040(2) prior to July 1, 2006.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon completion of each biennial actuarial valuation, the state actuary shall review the appropriateness of this minimum total contribution rate and recommend to the council any adjustments as may be needed. Any changes adopted by the council shall be subject to revision by the legislature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes the short-term volatility of projected employer contribution rates for the Washington state patrol retirement system and intends to phase-in the increase in contribution rates from the 2017-2019 biennium to the 2019-2021 biennium over three successive biennia. The phase-in shall be calculated by the state actuary and shall not result in an expected funding shortfall when measured over the entire phase-in period. Consistent with this intent, the legislature revises the basic employer contribution rate for the Washington state patrol retirement system from 22.13 percent to 17.5 percent during the 2019-2021 biennium. By June 30, 2020, the state actuary shall calculate and report to the council the expected change to the basic employer contribution rates for the 2021-2023 and 2023-2025 biennia that continue this phase-in.</p>
