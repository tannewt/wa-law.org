<ol>
<li>As Washington begins its second century of statehood, the legislature recognizes that renewed efforts are needed to preserve, conserve, and enhance the state's recreational resources. Rapid population growth and increased urbanization have caused a decline in suitable land for recreation and resulted in overcrowding and deterioration of existing facilities. Lack of adequate recreational resources directly affects the health and well-being of all citizens of the state, reduces the state's economic viability, and prevents Washington from maintaining and achieving the quality of life that it deserves.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is therefore the policy of the state and its agencies to preserve, conserve, and enhance recreational resources and open space. In carrying out this policy, the mission of the recreation and conservation funding board and its office is to (a) create and work actively for the implementation of a unified statewide strategy for meeting the recreational needs of Washington's citizens, (b) represent and promote the interests of the state on recreational issues in concert with other state and local agencies and the governor, (c) encourage and provide interagency and regional coordination, and interaction between public and private organizations, (d) administer recreational grant-in-aid programs and provide technical assistance, and (e) serve as a repository for information, studies, research, and other data relating to recreation.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Washington is uniquely endowed with fresh and salt waters rich in scenic and recreational value. This outdoor heritage enriches the lives of citizens, attracts new residents and businesses to the state, and is a major support of its expanding tourist industry. Rising population, increased income and leisure time, and the rapid growth of boating and other water sports have greatly increased the demand for water related recreation, while waterfront land is rapidly rising in value and disappearing from public use. There is consequently an urgent need for the acquisition or improvement of waterfront land on fresh and salt water suitable for marine recreational use by Washington residents and visitors. To meet this need, it is necessary and proper that the portion of motor vehicle fuel taxes paid by boat owners and operators on fuel consumed in their watercraft and not reclaimed as presently provided by law should be expended for the acquisition or improvement of marine recreation land on the Pacific Ocean, Puget Sound, bays, lakes, rivers, reservoirs and other fresh and salt waters of the state.</li>

<p>The legislature recognizes that coordinated funding efforts are needed to maintain, develop, and improve the state's community outdoor athletic fields. Rapid population growth and increased urbanization have caused a decline in suitable outdoor fields for community athletic activities and has resulted in overcrowding and deterioration of existing surfaces. Lack of adequate community outdoor athletic fields directly affects the health and well-being of all citizens of the state, reduces the state's economic viability, and prevents Washington from maintaining and achieving the quality of life that it deserves. Therefore, it is the policy of the state and its agencies to maintain, develop, fund, and improve youth or community athletic facilities, including but not limited to community outdoor athletic fields.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In carrying out this policy, the legislature intends to promote the building of new community outdoor athletic fields, the upgrading of existing community outdoor athletic fields, and the maintenance of existing community outdoor athletic fields across the state of Washington.</p>
