<h2 id="section-1-1270">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1270">¶</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this act is to provide insurance consumers the best possible outcome from the use of credit history in the underwriting of their insurance and the determination of their premium at renewal. The use of credit history shall neither make insurance coverage more unaffordable for insureds whose credit scores decrease, nor increase it for insureds on fixed incomes who have benefited from low rates because of the use of credit-based insurance scores. By providing this consumer protection, the legislature intends to offer insurers an option to continue to predict risk effectively while limiting the negative outcomes a lower credit score may have on an insured's premium.</p>

RCW 48.19.040(5) does not apply to any information filed under this subsection, and the information shall be withheld from public inspection and kept confidential by the commissioner.

</li>
<li>
<p>Insurers shall not use the following  to calculate a personal insurance score or determine personal insurance premiums or rates:</p>
<ol type="a">

<li>
<p>The consumer's use of a particular type of credit card, charge card, or debit card;</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a consumer is charged higher premiums due to disputed credit history, the insurer shall rerate the policy retroactive to the effective date of the current policy term. As rerated, the consumer shall be charged the same premiums they would have been charged if accurate credit history was used to calculate an insurance score. This subsection applies only if the consumer resolves the dispute under the process set forth in the fair credit reporting act and notifies the insurer in writing that the dispute has been resolved.</p>

<li>
<p>The commissioner may adopt rules to implement this section.</p>

<p><strong>Beginning July 1, 2023:</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p><strong>A policyholder may request, no more than once per insurer per policy line annually, that the insurer rerate the policyholder's insurance scores according to the standards that the insurer would apply if the consumer were initially applying for the same insurance policy.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The insurer shall rerate a policyholder at renewal after receiving a request from the policyholder or their agent. The insurer shall rerate the policy based upon a current credit history report or insurance score. The policyholder's current credit history report or insurance score shall only be used if the result of the rerate reduces the consumer's premium. If a policyholder's credit history is reordered, or if the existing credit history is used, it shall not result in an increase in premium. The effective date of any rate change is the next date of renewal.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Except as provided in (a) and (b) of this subsection, an insurer may only use rating factors other than credit history or insurance score to rerate the policy at renewal.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p><strong>Insurers may resume the use of credit history via a note to reviewer or a new filing. If an insured's premium was previously determined using credit history, the prior credit history may be used at the first renewal after enactment of this act.</strong></p>
