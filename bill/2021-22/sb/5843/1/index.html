<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<p>The state of Washington is a leader in the country regarding election security and voter accessibility. The state is routinely held as a model for other states to implement practices that were early adopted by Washington such as vote by mail, same day registration, and prepaid ballot postage, all of which are secure and increase voter access. Unfortunately, during the 2020 election, false claims regarding the validity of the 2020 election results were made by individuals who were attempting to undermine the election results because their preferred candidate or candidates were not successful in the 2020 general election. Thousands of Americans believed the false statements made by elected officials and candidates for office regarding the election results and sieged the United States capitol on January 6, 2021, with the intent to overturn the 2020 presidential election results.</p>
<p>False claims about our election system are damaging, but such claims are even more damaging when made by elected officials. In the aftermath of the January 6th events, we saw how false statements about the 2020 general election resulted in imminent lawlessness that included five deaths, hundreds of injuries with at least 137 law enforcement officers who sustained injuries, and over $30 million in damage to the United States capitol.</p>
<p>The United States supreme court has ruled that states have the power to restrict speech that incites or produces imminent lawless action (Brandenburg v. Ohio). It is the intent of the legislature to hold elected officials and those that seek to hold an elected position who have taken an oath to uphold the Constitutions of the United States and state of Washington accountable and to prohibit these individuals from bringing forward false claims with the purpose of casting doubt on one of our most sacred institutions.</p>
