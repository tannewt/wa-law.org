<p>The board shall establish by rule a program for the acquisition of riparian open space and critical habitat for threatened or endangered species as designated by the board. Acquisition must be a conservation easement. Lands eligible for acquisition are forestlands within unconfined channel migration zones or forestlands containing critical habitat for threatened or endangered species as designated by the board. Once acquired, these lands may be held and managed by the department, transferred to another state agency, transferred to an appropriate local government agency, or transferred to a private nonprofit nature conservancy corporation, as defined in RCW 64.04.130, in fee or transfer of management obligation. The board shall adopt rules governing the acquisition by the state or donation to the state of such interest in lands including the right of refusal if the lands are subject to unacceptable liabilities. The rules shall include definitions of qualifying lands, priorities for acquisition, and provide for the opportunity to transfer such lands with limited warranties and with a description of boundaries that does not require full surveys where the cost of securing the surveys would be unreasonable in relation to the value of the lands conveyed. The rules shall provide for the management of the lands for ecological protection or fisheries enhancement. For the purposes of conservation easements entered into under this section, the following apply:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>For conveyances of a conservation easement in which the landowner conveys an interest in the trees only, the compensation must include the timber value component, as determined by the cruised volume of any timber located within the channel migration zone or critical habitat for threatened or endangered species as designated by the board, multiplied by the appropriate quality code stumpage value for timber of the same species shown on the appropriate table used for timber harvest excise tax purposes under RCW 84.33.091;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For conveyances of a conservation easement in which the landowner conveys interests in both land and trees, the compensation must include the timber value component in (a)(i) of this subsection plus such portion of the land value component as determined just and equitable by the department. The land value component must be the acreage of qualifying channel migration zone or critical habitat for threatened or endangered species as determined by the board, to be conveyed, multiplied by the average per acre value of all commercial forestland in western Washington or the average for eastern Washington, whichever average is applicable to the qualifying lands. The department must determine the western and eastern Washington averages based on the land value tables established by RCW 84.33.140 and revised annually by the department of revenue.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to appropriations sufficient to cover the cost of such an acquisition program and the related costs of administering the program, the department must establish a conservation easement in land that an owner tenders for purchase; provided that such lands have been taxed as forestlands and are located within an unconfined channel migration zone or contain critical habitat for threatened or endangered species as designated by the board. Lands acquired under this section shall become riparian or habitat open space. These acquisitions shall not be deemed to trigger the compensating tax of chapters 84.33 and 84.34 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of offering to sell interests in qualifying lands, owners may elect to donate the interests to the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any acquired interest in qualifying lands by the state under this section shall be managed as riparian open space or critical habitat.</p>

<li>The board shall establish by rule which forest practices shall be included within each of the following classes:</li>
</ol>
<p>Class I: Minimal or specific forest practices that have no direct potential for damaging a public resource and that may be conducted without submitting an application or a notification except that when the regulating authority is transferred to a local governmental entity, those Class I forest practices that involve timber harvesting or road construction within &quot;urban growth areas,&quot; designated pursuant to chapter 36.70A RCW, are processed as Class IV forest practices, but are not subject to environmental review under chapter 43.21C RCW;</p>
<p>Class II: Forest practices which have a less than ordinary potential for damaging a public resource that may be conducted without submitting an application and may begin five calendar days, or such lesser time as the department may determine, after written notification by the operator, in the manner, content, and form as prescribed by the department, is received by the department. However, the work may not begin until all forest practice fees required under RCW 76.09.065 have been received by the department. Class II shall not include forest practices:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>On forestlands that are being converted to another use;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within &quot;shorelines of the state&quot; as defined in RCW 90.58.030;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excluded from Class II by the board; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Including timber harvesting or road construction within &quot;urban growth areas,&quot; designated pursuant to chapter 36.70A RCW, which are Class IV;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Class III: Forest practices other than those contained in Class I, II, or IV. A Class III application must be approved or disapproved by the department according to the following timelines; however, the applicant may not begin work on the forest practice until all forest practice fees required under RCW 76.09.065 have been received by the department:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Within thirty calendar days from the date the department receives the application if the application is not subject to concurrence review by the department of fish and wildlife under RCW 76.09.490; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within thirty days of the completion of the concurrence review by the department of fish and wildlife if the application is subject to concurrence review by the department of fish and wildlife under RCW 76.09.490;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Class IV: Forest practices other than those contained in Class I or II:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>On forestlands that are being converted to another use;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On lands which, pursuant to RCW 76.09.070 as now or hereafter amended, are not to be reforested because of the likelihood of future conversion to urban development;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That involve timber harvesting or road construction on forestlands that are contained within &quot;urban growth areas,&quot; designated pursuant to chapter 36.70A RCW, except where the forestland owner provides:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>A written statement of intent signed by the forestland owner not to convert to a use other than commercial forest product operations for ten years, accompanied by either a written forest management plan acceptable to the department or documentation that the land is enrolled under the provisions of chapter 84.33 or 84.34 RCW; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A conversion option harvest plan approved by the local governmental entity and submitted to the department as part of the application; and/or</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which have a potential for a substantial impact on the environment and therefore require an evaluation by the department as to whether or not a detailed statement must be prepared pursuant to the state environmental policy act, chapter 43.21C RCW. Such evaluation shall be made within the timelines established in RCW 43.21C.037; however, nothing herein shall be construed to prevent any local or regional governmental entity from determining that a detailed statement must be prepared for an action pursuant to a Class IV forest practice taken by that governmental entity concerning the land on which forest practices will be conducted. Unless the application is subject to concurrence review by the department of fish and wildlife under RCW 76.09.490, a Class IV application must be approved or disapproved by the department within thirty calendar days from the date the department receives the application. If a Class IV application is subject to concurrence review by the department of fish and wildlife under RCW 76.09.490, then the application must be approved or disapproved by the department within thirty calendar days from the completion of the concurrence review by the department of fish and wildlife. However, the department may extend the timelines applicable to the approval or disapproval of the application an additional thirty calendar days if the department determines that a detailed statement must be made, unless the commissioner of public lands, through the promulgation of a formal order, determines that the process cannot be completed within such a period. However, the applicant may not begin work on that forest practice until all forest practice fees required under RCW 76.09.065 have been received by the department.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Forest practices under Classes I, II, and III are exempt from the requirements for preparation of a detailed statement under the state environmental policy act.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Except for those forest practices being regulated by local governmental entities as provided elsewhere in this chapter, no Class II, Class III, or Class IV forest practice shall be commenced or continued after January 1, 1975, unless the department has received a notification with regard to a Class II forest practice or approved an application with regard to a Class III or Class IV forest practice containing all information required by RCW 76.09.060 as now or hereafter amended. However, in the event forest practices regulations necessary for the scheduled implementation of this chapter and RCW 90.48.420 have not been adopted in time to meet such schedules, the department shall have the authority to regulate forest practices and approve applications on such terms and conditions consistent with this chapter and RCW 90.48.420 and the purposes and policies of RCW 76.09.010 until applicable forest practices regulations are in effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except for those forest practices being regulated by local governmental entities as provided elsewhere in this chapter, if a notification or application is delivered in person to the department by the operator or the operator's agent, the department shall immediately provide a dated receipt thereof. In all other cases, the department shall immediately mail a dated receipt to the operator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except for those forest practices being regulated by local governmental entities as provided elsewhere in this chapter, forest practices shall be conducted in accordance with the forest practices regulations, orders and directives as authorized by this chapter or the forest practices regulations, and the terms and conditions of any approved applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except for those forest practices being regulated by local governmental entities as provided elsewhere in this chapter, the department of natural resources shall notify the applicant in writing of either its approval of the application or its disapproval of the application and the specific manner in which the application fails to comply with the provisions of this section or with the forest practices regulations. Except as provided otherwise in this section, if the department fails to either approve or disapprove an application or any portion thereof within the applicable time limit, the application shall be deemed approved and the operation may be commenced: PROVIDED, That this provision shall not apply to applications which are neither approved nor disapproved pursuant to the provisions of subsection (7) of this section: PROVIDED, FURTHER, That if seasonal field conditions prevent the department from being able to properly evaluate the application, the department may issue an approval conditional upon further review within sixty days.

<li>
<p>The objections relate to forestlands that are being converted to another use.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The department shall either disapprove those portions of such application or appeal the county, city, or town objections to the appeals board.

<ol start="8">
<li>
<p>For those forest practices regulated by the board and the department, in addition to any rights under the above paragraph, the county, city, or town may appeal any department approval of an application with respect to any lands within its jurisdiction.

<li>
<p>For those forest practices regulated by the board and the department, appeals under this section shall be made to the appeals board in the manner and time provided in RCW 76.09.205.

<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the levels of fish stocks throughout much of the state require immediate action to be taken to help these fish runs where possible. The legislature also recognizes that federal and state agencies, tribes, county representatives, and private timberland owners have spent considerable effort and time to develop the forests and fish report. Given the agreement of the parties, the legislature believes that the immediate adoption of emergency rules is appropriate in this particular instance. These rules can implement many provisions of the forests and fish report to protect the economic well-being of the state, and to minimize the risk to the state and landowners to legal challenges. This authority is not designed to set any precedents for the forest practices board in future rule making or set any precedents for other rule-making bodies of the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The forest practices board is authorized to adopt emergency rules amending the forest practices rules with respect to the protection of aquatic resources, in accordance with RCW 34.05.350, except: (a)(i) That the rules adopted under this section may remain in effect until permanent rules are adopted, or until June 30, 2001, whichever is sooner; (ii) that the rules adopted under RCW 76.09.420(5) must remain in effect until permanent rules are adopted; (b) notice of the proposed rules must be published in the Washington State Register as provided in RCW 34.05.320; (c) at least one public hearing must be conducted with an opportunity to provide oral and written comments; and (d) a rule-making file must be maintained as required by RCW 34.05.370. In adopting emergency rules consistent with this section, the board is not required to prepare a small business economic impact statement under chapter 19.85 RCW, prepare a statement indicating whether the rules constitute a significant legislative rule under RCW 34.05.328, prepare a significant legislative rule analysis under RCW 34.05.328, or follow the procedural requirements of the state environmental policy act, chapter 43.21C RCW. Except as provided in RCW 76.09.420, the forest practices board may only adopt recommendations contained in the forests and fish report as emergency rules under this section.</p>

<p>The application for a forest practice or the notification of a forest practice is subject to the reforestation requirement of RCW 76.09.070.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If the application states that any land will be or is intended to be converted:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The reforestation requirements of this chapter and of the forest practices rules shall not apply if the land is in fact converted unless applicable alternatives or limitations are provided in forest practices rules issued under RCW 76.09.070;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Completion of such forest practice operations shall be deemed conversion of the lands to another use for purposes of chapters 84.33 and 84.34 RCW unless the conversion is to a use permitted under a current use tax agreement permitted under chapter 84.34 RCW;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The forest practices described in the application are subject to applicable county, city, town, and regional governmental authority permitted under RCW 76.09.240 as well as the forest practices rules.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided elsewhere in this section, if the landowner harvests without an approved application or notification or the landowner does not state that any land covered by the application or notification will be or is intended to be converted, and the department or the county, city, town, or regional governmental entity becomes aware of conversion activities to a use other than commercial timber operations, as that term is defined in RCW 76.09.020, then the department shall send to the department of ecology and the appropriate county, city, town, and regional governmental entities the following documents:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>A notice of a conversion to nonforestry use;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A copy of the applicable forest practices application or notification, if any; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copies of any applicable outstanding final orders or decisions issued by the department related to the forest practices application or notification.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failure to comply with the reforestation requirements contained in any final order or decision shall constitute a removal of designation under the provisions of RCW 84.33.140, and a change of use under the provisions of RCW 84.34.080, and, if applicable, shall subject such lands to the payments and/or penalties resulting from such removals or changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conversion to a use other than commercial forest product operations within six years after approval of the forest practices application or notification without the consent of the county, city, or town shall constitute a violation of each of the county, municipal city, town, and regional authorities to which the forest practice operations would have been subject if the application had stated an intent to convert.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Land that is the subject of a notice of conversion to a nonforestry use produced by the department and sent to the department of ecology and a local government under this subsection is subject to the development prohibition and conditions provided in RCW 76.09.460.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Landowners who have not stated an intent to convert the land covered by an application or notification and who decide to convert the land to a nonforestry use within six years of receiving an approved application or notification must do so in a manner consistent with RCW 76.09.470.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application or notification must include a statement requiring an acknowledgment by the forestland owner of his or her intent with respect to conversion and acknowledging that he or she is familiar with the effects of this subsection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever an approved application authorizes a forest practice which, because of soil condition, proximity to a water course or other unusual factor, has a potential for causing material damage to a public resource, as determined by the department, the applicant shall, when requested on the approved application, notify the department two days before the commencement of actual operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before the operator commences any forest practice in a manner or to an extent significantly different from that described in a previously approved application or notification, there shall be submitted to the department a new application or notification form in the manner set forth in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Except as provided in RCW 76.09.350(4), the notification to or the approval given by the department to an application to conduct a forest practice shall be effective for a term of three years from the date of approval or notification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A notification or application may be renewed for an additional three-year term by the filing and approval of a notification or application, as applicable, prior to the expiration of the original application or notification. A renewal application or notification is subject to the forest practices rules in effect at the time the renewal application or notification is filed. Nothing in this section precludes the applicant from applying for a new application or notification after the renewal period has lapsed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the option of the applicant, an application or notification may be submitted to cover a single forest practice or a number of forest practices within reasonable geographic or political boundaries as specified by the department. An application or notification that covers more than one forest practice may have an effective term of more than three years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board shall adopt rules that establish standards and procedures for approving an application or notification that has an effective term of more than three years. Such rules shall include extended time periods for application or notification approval or disapproval. The department may require the applicant to provide advance notice before commencing operations on an approved application or notification.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no prior application or notification shall be required for any emergency forest practice necessitated by fire, flood, windstorm, earthquake, or other emergency as defined by the board, but the operator shall submit an application or notification, whichever is applicable, to the department within forty-eight hours after commencement of such practice or as required by local regulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forest practices applications or notifications are not required for forest practices conducted to control exotic forest insect or disease outbreaks, when conducted by or under the direction of the department of agriculture in carrying out an order of the governor or director of the department of agriculture to implement pest control measures as authorized under chapter 17.24 RCW, and are not required when conducted by or under the direction of the department in carrying out emergency measures under a forest health emergency declaration by the commissioner of public lands as provided in RCW 76.06.130.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this subsection, exotic forest insect or disease has the same meaning as defined in RCW 76.06.020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to minimize adverse impacts to public resources, control measures must be based on integrated pest management, as defined in RCW 17.15.010, and must follow forest practices rules relating to road construction and maintenance, timber harvest, and forest chemicals, to the extent possible without compromising control objectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agencies conducting or directing control efforts must provide advance notice to the appropriate regulatory staff of the department of the operations that would be subject to exemption from forest practices application or notification requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the appropriate regulatory staff of the department are notified under (c) of this subsection, they must consult with the landowner, interested agencies, and affected tribes, and assist the notifying agencies in the development of integrated pest management plans that comply with forest practices rules as required under (b) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing under this subsection relieves agencies conducting or directing control efforts from requirements of the federal clean water act as administered by the department of ecology under RCW 90.48.260.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forestlands where trees have been cut as part of an exotic forest insect or disease control effort under this subsection are subject to reforestation requirements under RCW 76.09.070.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The exemption from obtaining approved forest practices applications or notifications does not apply to forest practices conducted after the governor, the director of the department of agriculture, or the commissioner of public lands have declared that an emergency no longer exists because control objectives have been met, that there is no longer an imminent threat, or that there is no longer a good likelihood of control.</p>

<p>Every person who violates any provision of RCW 76.09.010 through 76.09.280 or of the forest practices rules, or who converts forestland to a use other than commercial timber operation within three years after completion of the forest practice without the consent of the county, city, or town, shall be subject to a penalty in an amount of not more than ten thousand dollars for every such violation. Each and every such violation shall be a separate and distinct offense. In case of a failure to comply with a stop work order, every day's continuance shall be a separate and distinct violation. Every person who through an act of commission or omission procures, aids or abets in the violation shall be considered to have violated the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the penalty in this section. No penalty shall be imposed under this section upon any governmental official, an employee of any governmental department, agency, or entity, or a member of any board or advisory committee created by this chapter for any act or omission in his or her duties in the administration of this chapter or of any rule adopted under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall develop and recommend to the board a penalty schedule to determine the amount to be imposed under this section. The board shall adopt by rule, pursuant to chapter 34.05 RCW, such penalty schedule to be effective no later than January 1, 1994. The schedule shall be developed in consideration of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Previous violation history;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Severity of the impact on public resources;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the violation of this chapter or its rules was intentional;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cooperation with the department;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repairability of the adverse effect from the violation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The extent to which a penalty to be imposed on a forestland owner for a forest practice violation committed by another should be reduced because the owner was unaware of the violation and has not received substantial economic benefits from the violation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The penalty in this section shall be imposed by a notice in writing, either by certified mail with return receipt requested or by personal service, to the person incurring the same from the department describing the violation with reasonable particularity. Within fifteen days after the notice is received, the person incurring the penalty may apply in writing to the department for the remission or mitigation of such penalty. Upon receipt of the application, that department may remit or mitigate the penalty upon whatever terms that department in its discretion deems proper, provided the department deems such remission or mitigation to be in the best interests of carrying out the purposes of this chapter. The department shall have authority to ascertain the facts regarding all such applications in such reasonable manner and under such rule as it may deem proper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any person incurring a penalty under this section may appeal the penalty to the appeals board. Such appeals shall be filed within thirty days after the date of receipt of the penalty unless an application for remission or mitigation is made to the department. When such an application for remission or mitigation is made, such appeals shall be filed within thirty days of receipt of notice from the department setting forth the disposition of the application for remission or mitigation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The penalty imposed under this section shall become due and payable thirty days after receipt of a notice imposing the same unless application for remission or mitigation is made or an appeal is filed. When such an application for remission or mitigation is made, any penalty incurred under this section shall become due and payable thirty days after receipt of notice setting forth the disposition of such application unless an appeal is filed from such disposition. Whenever an appeal of the penalty incurred is filed, the penalty shall become due and payable only upon completion of all administrative and judicial review proceedings and the issuance of a final decision confirming the penalty in whole or in part.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the amount of any penalty is not paid to the department within thirty days after it becomes due and payable, the attorney general, upon the request of the department, shall bring an action in the name of the state of Washington in the superior court of Thurston county or of any county in which such violator may do business, to recover such penalty, interest, costs, and attorneys' fees. In all such actions the procedure and rules of evidence shall be the same as an ordinary civil action except as otherwise provided in this chapter. In addition to or as an alternative to seeking enforcement of penalties in superior court, the department may bring an action in district court as provided in Title 3 RCW, to collect penalties, interest, costs, and attorneys' fees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Penalties imposed under this section for violations associated with a conversion to a use other than commercial timber operation shall be a lien upon the real property of the person assessed the penalty and the department may collect such amount in the same manner provided in chapter 60.04 RCW for mechanics' liens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any person incurring a penalty imposed under this section is also responsible for the payment of all costs and attorneys' fees incurred in connection with the penalty and interest accruing on the unpaid penalty amount.</p>

<p>The legislature hereby finds and declares that riparian ecosystems on forestlands in addition to containing valuable timber resources, provide benefits for wildlife, fish, and water quality. The legislature further finds and declares that leaving riparian areas unharvested and leaving snags and green trees for large woody debris recruitment for streams and rivers provides public benefits including but not limited to benefits for threatened and endangered salmonids, other fish, amphibians, wildlife, and water quality enhancement. The legislature further finds and declares that leaving upland areas unharvested for wildlife and leaving snags and green trees for future snag recruitment provides benefits for wildlife. Forestland owners may be required to leave trees standing in riparian and upland areas to benefit public resources. It is recognized that these trees may blow down or fall into streams and that organic debris may be allowed to remain in streams. This is beneficial to riparian dependent and other wildlife species. Further, it is recognized that trees may blow down, fall onto, or otherwise cause damage or injury to public improvements, private property, and persons. Notwithstanding any statutory provision, rule, or common law doctrine to the contrary, the landowner, the department, and the state of Washington shall not be held liable for any injury or damages resulting from these actions, including but not limited to wildfire, erosion, flooding, personal injury, property damage, damage to public improvements, and other injury or damages of any kind or character resulting from the trees being left.</p>

<p>The legislature recognizes the importance of providing the greatest diversity of habitats, particularly riparian, wetland, and old growth habitats, and of assuring the greatest diversity of species within those habitats for the survival and reproduction of enough individuals to maintain the native wildlife of Washington forestlands. The legislature also recognizes the importance of long-term habitat productivity for natural and wild fish, for the protection of hatchery water supplies, and for the protection of water quality and quantity to meet the needs of people, fish, and wildlife. The legislature recognizes the importance of maintaining and enhancing fish and wildlife habitats capable of sustaining the commercial and noncommercial uses of fish and wildlife. The legislature further recognizes the importance of the continued growth and development of the state's forest products industry which has a vital stake in the long-term productivity of both the public and private forestland base.</p>
<p>The development of a landscape planning system would help achieve these goals. Landowners and resource managers should be provided incentives to voluntarily develop long-term multispecies landscape management plans that will provide protection to public resources. Because landscape planning represents a departure from the use of standard baseline rules and may result in unintended consequences to both the affected habitats and to a landowner's economic interests, the legislature desires to establish up to seven experimental pilot programs to gain experience with landscape planning that may prove useful in fashioning legislation of a more general application.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Until December 31, 2000, the department in cooperation with the department of fish and wildlife, and the department of ecology when relating to water quality protection, is granted authority to select not more than seven pilot projects for the purpose of developing individual landowner multispecies landscape management plans.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Pilot project participants must be selected by the department in cooperation with the department of fish and wildlife, and the department of ecology when relating to water quality protection, no later than October 1, 1997.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number and the location of the pilot projects are to be determined by the department in cooperation with the department of fish and wildlife, and the department of ecology when relating to water quality protection, and should be selected on the basis of risk to the habitat and species, variety and importance of species and habitats in the planning area, geographic distribution, surrounding ownership, other ongoing landscape and watershed planning activities in the area, potential benefits to water quantity and quality, financial and staffing capabilities of participants, and other factors that will contribute to the creation of landowner multispecies landscape planning efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each pilot project shall have a landscape management plan with the following elements:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>An identification of public resources selected for coverage under the plan and measurable objectives for the protection of the selected public resources;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A termination date of not later than 2050;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Conditions under which a plan may be terminated;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A procedure for adaptive management that evaluates the effectiveness of the plan to meet its measurable public resources objectives, reflects changes in the best available science, and provides changes to its habitat management strategies, prescriptions, and hydraulic project standards to the extent agreed to in the plan and in a timely manner and schedule;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Measurably improve habitat conditions for species selected for special consideration under the plan;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The plan shall include watershed analysis or provide for a level of protection that meets or exceeds the protection that would be provided by watershed analysis, if the landowner selects fish or water quality as a public resource to be covered under the plan. Any alternative process to watershed analysis would be subject to timely peer review;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The planning process provides for a public participation process during the development of the plan, which shall be developed by the department in cooperation with the landowner.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The management plans must be submitted to the department and the department of fish and wildlife, and the department of ecology when the landowner elects to cover water quality in the plan, no later than March 1, 2000. The department shall provide an opportunity for public comment on the proposed plan. The comment period shall not be less than forty-five days. The department shall approve or reject plans within one hundred twenty days of submittal by the landowner of a final plan. The decision by the department, in agreement with the department of fish and wildlife, and the department of ecology when the landowner has elected to cover water quality in the plan, to approve or disapprove the management plan is subject to the environmental review process of chapter 43.21C RCW, provided that any public comment period provided for under chapter 43.21C RCW shall run concurrently with the public comment period provided in this subsection (2).</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department is authorized to issue a single landscape level permit valid for the life of the plan to a landowner who has an approved landscape management plan and who has requested a landscape permit from the department. Landowners receiving a landscape level permit shall meet annually with the department and the department of fish and wildlife, and the department of ecology where water quality has been selected as a public resource to be covered under the plan, to review the specific forest practices activities planned for the next twelve months and to determine whether such activities are in compliance with the plan. The departments will consult with the affected Indian tribes and other interested parties who have expressed an interest in connection with the review. The landowner is to provide ten calendar days' notice to the department prior to the commencement of any forest practices authorized under a landscape level permit. The landscape level permit will not impose additional conditions relating to the public resources selected for coverage under the plan beyond those agreed to in the plan. For the purposes of chapter 43.21C RCW, forest practices conducted in compliance with an approved plan are deemed not to have the potential for a substantial impact on the environment as to any public resource selected for coverage under the plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in a plan, the agreement implementing the landscape management plan is an agreement that runs with the property covered by the approved landscape management plan and the department shall record notice of the plan in the real property records of the counties in which the affected properties are located. Prior to its termination, no plan shall permit forestland covered by its terms to be withdrawn from such coverage, whether by sale, exchange, or other means, nor to be converted to nonforestry uses except to the extent that such withdrawal or conversion would not measurably impair the achievement of the plan's stated public resource objectives. If a participant transfers all or part of its interest in the property, the terms of the plan still apply to the new landowner for the plan's stated duration unless the plan is terminated under its terms or unless the plan specifies the conditions under which the terms of the plan do not apply to the new landowner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The departments of natural resources, fish and wildlife, and ecology shall seek to develop memorandums of agreements with federal agencies and affected Indian tribes relating to tribal issues in the landscape management plans. The departments shall solicit input from affected Indian tribes in connection with the selection, review, and approval of any landscape management plan. If any recommendation is received from an affected Indian tribe and is not adopted by the departments, the departments shall provide a written explanation of their reasons for not adopting the recommendation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department is directed to report to the forest practices board annually through the year 2000, but no later than December 31st of each year, on the status of each pilot project. The department is directed to provide to the forest practices board, no later than December 31, 2000, an evaluation of the pilot projects including a determination if a permanent landscape planning process should be established along with a discussion of what legislative and rule modifications are necessary.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the process that produced the forests and fish report was instigated by the forest practices board, the report is the product of considerable negotiations between several diverse interest groups, and the report has the support of key federal agencies. When adopting permanent rules under this section, the forest practices board is strongly encouraged to follow the recommendations of the forests and fish report, but may include other alternatives for protection of aquatic resources. If the forest practices board chooses to adopt rules under this section that are not consistent with the recommendations contained in the forests and fish report, the board must notify the appropriate legislative committees of the proposed deviations, the reasons for the proposed deviations, and whether the parties to the forests and fish report still support the agreement. The board shall defer final adoption of such rules for sixty days of the legislative session to allow for the opportunity for additional public involvement and legislative oversight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The forest practices board shall follow the regular rules adoption process contained in the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW, when adopting permanent rules pertaining to forest practices and the protection of aquatic resources except as limited by subsection (1) of this section. The permanent rules must accomplish the policies stated in RCW 76.09.010 without jeopardizing the economic viability of the forest products industry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rules adopted under this section should be as specific as reasonably possible while also allowing an applicant to propose alternate plans in response to site-specific physical features. Alternate plans should provide protection to public resources at least equal in overall effectiveness by alternate means.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rule making under subsection (2) of this section shall be completed by June 30, 2001.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board should consider coordinating any environmental review process under chapter 43.21C RCW relating to the adoption of rules under subsection (2) of this section with any review of a related proposal under the national environmental policy act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 4321, et seq.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the board has adopted permanent rules under subsection (2) of this section, changes to those rules and any new rules covering aquatic resources may be adopted by the board but only if the changes or new rules are consistent with recommendations resulting from the scientifically based adaptive management process established by a rule of the board. Any new rules or changes under this subsection need not be based upon the recommendations of the adaptive management process if: (a) The board is required to adopt or modify rules by the final order of any court having jurisdiction thereof; or (b) future state legislation directs the board to adopt or modify the rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In adopting permanent rules, the board shall incorporate the scientific-based adaptive management process described in the forests and fish report which will be used to determine the effectiveness of the new forest practices rules in aiding the state's salmon recovery effort. The purpose of an adaptive management process is to make adjustments as quickly as possible to forest practices that are not achieving the resource objectives. The adaptive management process shall incorporate the best available science and information, include protocols and standards, regular monitoring, a scientific and peer review process, and provide recommendations to the board on proposed changes to forest practices rules to meet timber industry viability and salmon recovery.</p>

<li>
<p>The state may not require a small forestland owner to invest in upgrades, replacements, or other engineering of a forest road, and any fish passage barriers that are a part of the road, that do not threaten public resources or create a barrier to the passage of fish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participation in the forests and fish agreement provides a benefit to both the landowner in terms of federal assurances, and the public in terms of aquatic habitat preservation and water quality enhancement; therefore, if conditions do threaten public resources or create a fish passage barrier, the road maintenance and abandonment planning process may not require a small forestland owner to take a positive action that will result in high cost without a significant portion of that cost being shared by the public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some fish passage barriers are more of a threat to public resources than others; therefore, no small forestland owner should be required to repair a fish passage barrier until higher priority fish passage barriers on other lands in the watershed have been repaired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an existing fish passage barrier on land owned by a small forestland owner was installed under an approved forest practices application or notification, and hydraulics approval, and that fish passage barrier becomes a high priority for fish passage based on the watershed ranking in *RCW 76.13.150, one hundred percent public funding shall be provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The preparation of a road maintenance and abandonment plan can require technical expertise that may require large expenditures before the time that the landowner plans to conduct any revenue-generating operations on his or her land; therefore, small forestland owners should be allowed to complete a simplified road maintenance and abandonment plan checklist, that does not require professional engineering or forestry expertise to complete, and that does not need to be submitted until the time that the landowner submits a forest practices application or notification for final or intermediate harvesting, or for salvage of trees. Chapter 311, Laws of 2003 is intended to provide an alternate way for small forestland owners to comply with the road maintenance and abandonment plan goals identified in the forest practices rules.</p>
