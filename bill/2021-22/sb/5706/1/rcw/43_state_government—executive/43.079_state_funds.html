<p>Staff support for the committee is provided by the senate committee services and the house of representatives office of program research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Members of the committee serve without additional compensation, but must be reimbursed for travel expenses in accordance with RCW 44.04.120. The expenses of the committee are paid jointly by the senate and the house of representatives and expenditures are subject to approval by the senate facilities and operations committee and the house of representatives executive rules committee, or their successor committees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose of the committee is to review requests for proposed allotment amendments to spend unanticipated and unbudgeted moneys from federal and nonstate sources pursuant to RCW 43.79.270(3). The committee is necessary to provide oversight of the legislature's delegation of state fiscal authority to the governor while the legislature is not in session and to prevent infringement on the legislature's constitutional power to appropriate state funds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The committee shall meet as necessary to review requests from the governor pursuant to RCW 43.79.270(3) and to provide comment within 14 calendar days. The committee may conduct its meetings and hold public hearings by conference telephone call, videoconference, or using similar technology equipment so that all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time. The committee shall adopt rules and procedures for its orderly operation. The activities of the committee are suspended during regular or special legislative sessions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the committee chooses to conduct a public hearing on a proposed allotment amendment, the committee must provide the office of financial management with five calendar days notice of the public hearing. The office of financial management, or its designee, must appear before the committee to present the proposed allotment amendment and respond to questions. The committee may also require the state agency, department, board, or commission proposing the allotment amendment to appear before the committee, submit additional information, or engage in other activities necessary for the committee to review and comment on proposed allotment amendments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Action of the committee is limited to the review and comment on requests submitted by the governor under RCW 43.79.270(3). Action by the committee requires the majority vote of members of the committee in attendance at the meeting. Action may take the form of a recommendation approving the proposed allotment amendment, rejecting the proposed allotment amendment, or proposing an alternative allotment amendment for governor consideration prior to approval under RCW 43.79.280. The committee's action is not binding on the governor.</p>

<p>The legislature recognizes that efforts to restructure state operations to achieve greater efficiency are often impeded by the lack of a financing tool to support the transition and phase-down of state operations. The state efficiency and restructuring account is established in the state treasury to finance efforts to restructure state operations and achieve budget savings. Moneys from the account may be expended only after appropriation. As directed by the legislature, the state treasurer must transfer funds from specified accounts into the state efficiency and restructuring account to support appropriations from that account. The state treasurer must maintain a record of such transfers and must calculate repayment obligations to any accounts providing surplus funds for a term of eight years at an interest rate that is five-tenths of a [one] percent higher than the interest rate that the account would have earned without the transfer. The state treasurer must submit a report of all such repayment obligations to the office of financial management by September 1st of each year. The governor's budget request under RCW 43.88.060 must include sufficient funds to meet the biennial repayment obligation.</p>
