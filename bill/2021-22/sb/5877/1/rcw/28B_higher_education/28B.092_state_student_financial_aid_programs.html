<p>In awarding need grants, the office shall proceed substantially as follows: PROVIDED, That nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent the office, in the exercise of its sound discretion, from following another procedure when the best interest of the program so dictates:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The office shall annually select the financial aid award recipients from among Washington residents applying for student financial aid who have been ranked according to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>College bound scholarship eligibility. Eligible students as defined in RCW 28B.118.010 who meet the requirements in *RCW 28B.118.010(4)(b)(i) for the college bound scholarship may not be denied state need grant funding due to institutional policies or delayed awarding of college bound scholarship students. College bound scholarship eligible students whose family income exceeds sixty-five percent of the state median family income, but who are eligible for the state need grant, shall be prioritized and awarded the maximum state need grant for which the student is eligible;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial need as determined by the amount of the family contribution; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other considerations, such as whether the student is a former foster youth, or is a placebound student who has completed an associate of arts or associate of science degree or its equivalent.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The financial need of the highest ranked students shall be met by grants depending upon the evaluation of financial need until the total allocation has been disbursed. Funds from grants which are declined, forfeited or otherwise unused shall be reawarded until disbursed, except that eligible former foster youth shall be assured receipt of a grant. The office, in consultation with four-year institutions of higher education, the council, and the state board for community and technical colleges, shall develop award criteria and methods of disbursement based on level of need, and not solely rely on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A student shall be eligible to receive a state need grant for up to five years, or the credit or clock hour equivalent of five years, or up to one hundred twenty-five percent of the published length of time of the student's program. A student may not start a new associate degree program as a state need grant recipient until at least five years have elapsed since earning an associate degree as a need grant recipient, except that a student may earn two associate degrees concurrently. Qualifications for renewal will include maintaining satisfactory academic progress toward completion of an eligible program as determined by the office. Should the recipient terminate his or her enrollment for any reason during the academic year, the unused portion of the grant shall be returned to the state educational grant fund by the institution according to the institution's own policy for issuing refunds, except as provided in RCW 28B.92.070.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In computing financial need, the office shall determine a maximum student expense budget allowance, not to exceed an amount equal to the total maximum student expense budget at the public institutions plus the current average state appropriation per student for operating expense in the public institutions. Any child support payments received by students who are parents attending less than half-time shall not be used in computing financial need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A student who is enrolled in three to six credit-bearing quarter credits, or the equivalent semester credits, may receive a grant for up to one academic year before beginning a program that leads to a degree or certificate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An eligible student enrolled on a less-than-full-time basis shall receive a prorated portion of his or her state need grant for any academic period in which he or she is enrolled on a less-than-full-time basis, as long as funds are available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An institution of higher education may award a state need grant to an eligible student enrolled in three to six credit-bearing quarter credits, or the semester equivalent, on a provisional basis if:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The student has not previously received a state need grant from that institution;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The student completes the required free application for federal student aid;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The institution has reviewed the student's financial condition, and the financial condition of the student's family if the student is a dependent student, and has determined that the student is likely eligible for a state need grant; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The student has signed a document attesting to the fact that the financial information provided on the free application for federal student aid and any additional financial information provided directly to the institution is accurate and complete, and that the student agrees to repay the institution for the grant amount if the student submitted false or incomplete information.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>As used in this section, &quot;former foster youth&quot; means a person who is at least eighteen years of age, but not more than twenty-four years of age, who was a dependent of the department of social and health services at the time he or she attained the age of eighteen.</p>

<p>Every four years, institutions of higher education participating in the Washington college grant program must either:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Affirmatively opt out of compliance with (b) of this subsection; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sign an affidavit affirming that the institution's policies and practices are in compliance with the following provisions:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The institution prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immigration status, sex, veteran or military status, sexual orientation, or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal by a person with a disability;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The institution operates its education program or activity in a manner free of discrimination. No student shall be excluded from participation in an education program or activity, denied the benefits of an education program or activity, or subjected to discrimination on the basis of that student's age, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immigration status, veteran or military status, or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal by a person with a disability, unless based upon a bona fide qualification of the educational program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The institution, acting in its capacity as an employer, must not:</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) Refuse to hire, promote, or confer tenure to any person because of age, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immigration status, veteran or military status, or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal by a person with a disability, unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification. However, the prohibition against discrimination because of a disability in this subsection does not apply if the particular disability prevents the proper performance of the particular work involved. This subsection shall not be construed to require an employer to establish employment goals or quotas based on sexual orientation;</p>
<p>(B) Discharge or bar any person from employment because of age, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immigration status, veteran or military status, or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal by a person with a disability;</p>
<p>(C) Discriminate against any person in compensation or in other terms or conditions of employment because of age, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immigration status, veteran or military status, or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal by a person with a disability. However, this section does not prohibit an employer from segregating washrooms or locker facilities on the basis of sex, or basing other terms and conditions of employment on the sex of employees where the Washington state human rights commission, created under chapter 49.60 RCW, has by regulation or ruling in a particular instance found the employment practice to be appropriate for the practical realization of equality of opportunity between the sexes;</p>
<p>(D) Print, or circulate, or cause to be printed or circulated any statement, advertisement, or publication, or to use any form of application for employment, or to make any inquiry in connection with prospective employment, which expresses any limitation, specification, or discrimination as to age, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immigration status, veteran or military status, or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal by a person with a disability, or any intent to make any such limitation, specification, or discrimination, unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification. However, nothing in this subsection prohibits advertising in a foreign language.</p>

<p>Participation in theology academic programs; and employment, promotion, or tenure of faculty members for courses of study in theology are exempt from the requirements under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Institutions of higher education that take no action regarding the signing of the affidavit shall be determined to have opted out of compliance with subsection (1)(b) of this section. Institutions of higher education that opt out of compliance with subsection (1)(b) of this section are still eligible to participate in the Washington college grant program if they maintain compliance with all other requirements for participation in the program as determined by the office. Institutions that opt out of compliance with subsection (1)(b) of this section are eligible for maximum grants as defined in RCW 28B.92.030(9)(h).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Institutions of higher education that have signed the affidavit under subsection (1)(b) of this section but are determined to have engaged in an unfair practice as provided under this section, are eligible for maximum grants as defined in RCW 28B.92.030(9)(h) for a period of four years from the beginning of the academic year immediately following the date of the decision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is an unfair practice if an institution of higher education which has signed an affidavit agreeing to comply with the requirements under subsection (1)(b) of this section then engages in the discriminatory practices prohibited under subsection (1)(b) of this section. The attorney general may bring an action in the name of the state, against any institution of higher education, to restrain and prevent the doing of any act or practice prohibited by this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The attorney general shall investigate complaints and enforce this section, including by conference and conciliation. In addition to the complaint process with the attorney general, any person believed to be injured by a violation of this section has a civil cause of action in court to enjoin further violations, or to recover the actual damages sustained by the person, or both, together with the cost of suit and reasonable attorneys' fees or any other appropriate remedy authorized by state or federal law.</p>
