<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/71_mental_illness/71.32_mental_health_advance_directives.html">71.32.010</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/71_mental_illness/71.32_mental_health_advance_directives.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature declares that an individual with capacity has the ability to control decisions relating to his or her own <strong>behavioral</strong> health care. The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Some <strong>behavioral health disorders</strong> cause individuals to fluctuate between capacity and incapacity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During periods when an individual's capacity is unclear, the individual may be unable to access needed treatment because the individual may be unable to give informed consent;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Early treatment may prevent an individual from becoming so ill that involuntary treatment is necessary; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Individuals with behavioral health disorders</strong> need some method of expressing their instructions and preferences for treatment and providing advance consent to or refusal of treatment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that a mental health advance directive can be an essential tool for an individual to express his or her choices at a time when the effects of <strong>a behavioral health disorder</strong> have not deprived him or her of the power to express his or her instructions or preferences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A mental health advance directive must provide the individual with a full range of choices;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Individuals with behavioral health disorders</strong> have varying perspectives on whether they want to be able to revoke a directive during periods of incapacity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a mental health advance directive to be an effective tool, individuals must be able to choose how they want their directives treated during periods of incapacity; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There must be clear standards so that treatment providers can readily discern an individual's treatment choices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Consequently, the legislature affirms that, pursuant to other provisions of law, a validly executed mental health advance directive is to be respected by agents, guardians, and other surrogate decision makers, health care providers, professional persons, and health care facilities.</p>
