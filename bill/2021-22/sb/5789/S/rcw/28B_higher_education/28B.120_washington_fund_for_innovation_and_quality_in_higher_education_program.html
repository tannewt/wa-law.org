<p>The Washington fund for innovation and quality in higher education program is established. The student achievement council shall administer the program and shall work in close collaboration with the state board for community and technical colleges and other local and regional entities. Through this program the student achievement council may award on a competitive basis incentive grants to state public or private nonprofit institutions of higher education or consortia of institutions to encourage programs designed to address specific system problems. Each institution or consortia of institutions receiving the award shall contribute some financial support, either by covering part of the costs for the program during its implementation, or by assuming continuing support at the end of the grant period. Strong priority will be given to proposals that involve more than one sector of education. Institutions are encouraged to solicit nonstate funds to support these cooperative programs.</p>

<p>It is the intent of the legislature to update and fund the higher education competitive grant program established by the 1991 legislature, known as the Washington fund for innovation and quality in higher education. Changes are needed so that the goals and priorities set forth for awarding grants reflect the 1999-01 goals and priorities. The legislature also intends to improve the administration of the program by separating responsibilities between the *higher education coordinating board and the state board for community and technical colleges.</p>
