<h2 id="section-1-499">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-499">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the use of racially derogatory or discriminatory school mascots, logos, or team names in public schools is antithetical to their mission of providing an equal education to all, and contrary to the goal of making schools safe and respectful learning environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature therefore, recognizing that no school has a cognizable interest in retaining a racially derogatory or discriminatory school mascot, logo, or team name, intends to prohibit the inappropriate use of Native American names, symbols, or images for those purposes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2-390">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-390">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
