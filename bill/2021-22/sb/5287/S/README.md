# Substitute Senate Bill 5287 as Recommended by Housing & Local Government

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5287-S.xml)
## Section 1
> This section modifies existing section [84.14.005](/rcw/84_property_taxes/84.14_new_and_rehabilitated_multiple-unit_dwellings_in_urban_centers.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/84_property_taxes/84.14_new_and_rehabilitated_multiple-unit_dwellings_in_urban_centers.md) for context.

1. The legislature finds:

    a. That in many of Washington's urban centers there is insufficient availability of desirable and convenient residential units, including affordable housing units, to meet the needs of a growing number of the public who would live in these urban centers if these desirable, convenient, attractive, affordable, and livable places to live were available;

    b. That the development of additional and desirable residential units, including affordable housing units, in these urban centers that will attract and maintain a significant increase in the number of permanent residents in these areas will help to alleviate the detrimental conditions and social liability that tend to exist in the absence of a viable mixed income residential population and will help to achieve the planning goals mandated by the growth management act under RCW 36.70A.020; and

    c. That planning solutions to solve the problems of urban sprawl often lack incentive and implementation techniques needed to encourage residential redevelopment in those urban centers lacking a sufficient variety of residential opportunities, and it is in the public interest and will benefit, provide, and promote the public health, safety, and welfare to stimulate new or enhanced residential opportunities, including affordable housing opportunities, within urban centers through a tax incentive as provided by this chapter.

2. **Therefore, the legislature intends to achieve multiple goals by incentivizing the development of multiple-unit housing including creating additional affordable housing, encouraging urban development and density, increasing market rate workforce housing, developing permanently affordable housing opportunities, promoting economic investment and recovery, and creating family-wage jobs.**

1. [Empty]

    a. The value of new housing construction, conversion, and rehabilitation improvements qualifying under this chapter is exempt from ad valorem property taxation, as follows:

        i. For properties for which applications for certificates of tax exemption eligibility are submitted under this chapter before July 22, 2007, the value is exempt for ten successive years beginning January 1 of the year immediately following the calendar year of issuance of the certificate;

        ii. For properties for which applications for certificates of tax exemption eligibility are submitted under this chapter on or after July 22, 2007, the value is exempt:

(B) For twelve successive years beginning January 1st of the year immediately following the calendar year of issuance of the certificate, if the property otherwise qualifies for the exemption under this chapter and meets the conditions in this subsection (1)(a)(ii)(B). For the property to qualify for the twelve-year exemption under this subsection, the applicant must commit to renting or selling at least twenty percent of the multifamily housing units as affordable housing units to low and moderate‑income households, and the property must satisfy that commitment and any additional affordability and income eligibility conditions adopted by the local government under this chapter. In the case of projects intended exclusively for owner occupancy, the minimum requirement of this subsection (1)(a)(ii)(B) may be satisfied solely through housing affordable to moderate‑income households**; and**

        iii. **Until December 31, 2024, for 12 successive years beginning January 1st of the year immediately following the calendar year of issuance of the certificate, if the property otherwise qualifies for the exemption under this chapter and meets the conditions in this subsection (1)(a)(iii).

2. When a local government adopts guidelines pursuant to RCW 84.14.030(2) and includes conditions that must be satisfied with respect to individual dwelling units, rather than with respect to the multiple-unit housing as a whole or some minimum portion thereof, the exemption may, at the local government's discretion, be limited to the value of the qualifying improvements allocable to those dwelling units that meet the local guidelines.

5. At the conclusion of the exemption period, the **value of the new housing construction, conversion, or rehabilitation improvements must** be considered as new construction for the purposes of **chapters 84.55 and 36.21 RCW as though the property was not exempt under this chapter, unless it qualifies for an extension as provided under subsection (6) of this section**.

## Section 6
1. This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preferences contained in section 3, chapter . . ., Laws of 2021 (section 3 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preferences. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.

2. The legislature categorizes these tax preferences as ones intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(a).

3. It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to:

    a. Incentivize developers to construct or rehabilitate multifamily housing;

    b. Incentivize local governments and multifamily housing owners to maintain or expand existing income-restricted unit stock that have been incentivized through the tax exemption provided under chapter 84.14 RCW via new authority to renew the property tax abatement in exchange for continued or additional affordability; and

    c. Further encourage multifamily construction in cities and certain unincorporated urban growth areas by expanding access to the multifamily tax exemption program to a broader set of jurisdictions.

4. It is the legislature's intent to provide the value of new housing construction, conversion, and rehabilitation improvements qualifying under chapter 84.14 RCW an exemption from ad valorem property taxation for eight to 12 years or more, as provided for in RCW 84.14.020, in order to provide incentives to developers to construct or rehabilitate multifamily housing thereby increasing the number of affordable housing units, or preserving the state's stock of income-restricted units, for low-income to moderate-income residents in certain urban growth areas.

5. The legislature intends to extend the expiration date of the tax preferences in section 3, chapter . . ., Laws of 2021 (section 3 of this act), if a review finds that:

    a. Projects receiving an initial eight-year or 12-year exemption regularly enter into subsequent 12-year extensions in exchange for continued or increased income restrictions on affordable units; and

    b. At least 20 percent of the new housing is developed and occupied by households earning:

        i. At or below 80 percent of the area median income, at the time of occupancy, adjusted for family size for the county in which the project is located; or

        ii. Where the housing is intended exclusively for owner occupancy, up to 115 percent of the area median income, at the time of sale, adjusted for family size for the county in which the project is located.

6. In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee must refer to the annual reports compiled by the department of commerce under RCW 84.14.100 and may refer to data provided by counties or cities in which persons are utilizing the preferences, the office of financial management, the department of commerce, the United States department of housing and urban development, and any other data sources, as needed by the joint legislative audit and review committee.
