## Section 1
> This section modifies existing section [84.14.005](/rcw/84_property_taxes/84.14_new_and_rehabilitated_multiple-unit_dwellings_in_urban_centers.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/84_property_taxes/84.14_new_and_rehabilitated_multiple-unit_dwellings_in_urban_centers.md) for context.

1. The legislature finds:

    a. That in many of Washington's urban centers there is insufficient availability of desirable and convenient residential units, including affordable housing units, to meet the needs of a growing number of the public who would live in these urban centers if these desirable, convenient, attractive, affordable, and livable places to live were available;

    b. That the development of additional and desirable residential units, including affordable housing units, in these urban centers that will attract and maintain a significant increase in the number of permanent residents in these areas will help to alleviate the detrimental conditions and social liability that tend to exist in the absence of a viable mixed income residential population and will help to achieve the planning goals mandated by the growth management act under RCW 36.70A.020; and

    c. That planning solutions to solve the problems of urban sprawl often lack incentive and implementation techniques needed to encourage residential redevelopment in those urban centers lacking a sufficient variety of residential opportunities, and it is in the public interest and will benefit, provide, and promote the public health, safety, and welfare to stimulate new or enhanced residential opportunities, including affordable housing opportunities, within urban centers through a tax incentive as provided by this chapter.

2. **Therefore, the legislature intends to achieve multiple goals by incentivizing the development of multiple-unit housing including creating additional affordable housing, encouraging urban development and density, increasing market rate workforce housing, developing permanently affordable housing opportunities, promoting economic investment and recovery, and creating family-wage jobs.**

## Section 7
1. This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preferences contained in section 3, chapter . . ., Laws of 2021 (section 3 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preferences. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.

2. The legislature categorizes these tax preferences as ones intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(a).

3. It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to:

    a. Incentivize developers to construct or rehabilitate multifamily housing;

    b. Incentivize local governments and multifamily housing owners to maintain or expand existing income-restricted unit stock that have been incentivized through the tax exemption provided under chapter 84.14 RCW via new authority to renew the property tax abatement in exchange for continued or additional affordability; and

    c. Further encourage multifamily construction in cities and certain unincorporated urban growth areas by expanding access to the multifamily tax exemption program to a broader set of jurisdictions.

4. It is the legislature's intent to provide the value of new housing construction, conversion, and rehabilitation improvements qualifying under chapter 84.14 RCW an exemption from ad valorem property taxation for eight to 12 years or more, as provided for in RCW 84.14.020, in order to provide incentives to developers to construct or rehabilitate multifamily housing thereby increasing the number of affordable housing units, or preserving the state's stock of income-restricted units, for low-income to moderate-income residents in certain urban growth areas.

5. The legislature intends to extend the expiration date of the tax preferences in section 3, chapter . . ., Laws of 2021 (section 3 of this act), if a review finds that:

    a. Projects receiving an initial eight-year or 12-year exemption regularly enter into subsequent 12-year extensions in exchange for continued or increased income restrictions on affordable units; and

    b. At least 20 percent of the new housing is developed and occupied by households earning:

        i. At or below 80 percent of the area median income, at the time of occupancy, adjusted for family size for the county in which the project is located; or

        ii. Where the housing is intended exclusively for owner occupancy, up to 115 percent of the area median income, at the time of sale, adjusted for family size for the county in which the project is located.

6. In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee must refer to the annual reports compiled by the department of commerce under RCW 84.14.100 and may refer to data provided by counties or cities in which persons are utilizing the preferences, the office of financial management, the department of commerce, the United States department of housing and urban development, and any other data sources, as needed by the joint legislative audit and review committee.


## Section 8
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [84.14](/rcw/84_property_taxes/84.14_new_and_rehabilitated_multiple-unit_dwellings_in_urban_centers.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/84_property_taxes/84.14_new_and_rehabilitated_multiple-unit_dwellings_in_urban_centers.md) for context.

1.

For the property to qualify for the 20-year exemption under this section, at least 25 percent of the units must be sold to a qualified nonprofit or local government partner that will assure permanent affordable homeownership. The remaining 75 percent of units may be rented or sold at market rates.

2. Permanently affordable homeownership units must be sold to households earning no more than 80 percent of the average median income for the city or local jurisdiction in which the unit is located.

3. A local jurisdiction may assign and collect an administration fee at each point of sale to cover the administrative costs for oversight of the program to maintain permanently affordable housing units consistent with this section.

4. The exemptions in this section do not include the value of land or nonhousing-related improvements not qualifying under this chapter.

5. For purposes of this section:

        ii. Subject to a ground lease or deed restriction that includes:

(A) A resale restriction designed to provide affordability for future low and moderate-income homebuyers;

(B) A right of first refusal for the sponsor organization to purchase the home at resale; and

(C) A requirement that the sponsor must approve any refinancing, including home equity lines of credit.

        iii. Sponsored by a nonprofit organization or governmental entity and the sponsor organization:

(A) Executes a new ground lease or deed restriction with a duration of at least 99 years at the initial sale and with each successive sale; and

(B) Supports homeowners and enforces the ground lease or deed restriction.

    b. "Permanently affordable rental" means a rental unit that is owned and managed by a housing authority, or nonprofit or local governmental agency for the purpose of ensuring affordable housing, with income restrictions that meet or exceed the requirements of this chapter.

6. The department of commerce must develop a template for permanent affordability for home or condo ownership through deed restrictions that can be used by a city or local government to ensure compliance with this section.
