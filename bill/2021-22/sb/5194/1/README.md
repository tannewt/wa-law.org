# Senate Bill 5194

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5194.xml)
## Section 1
The legislature recognizes that student completion rates for workforce training certification and degree programs at community and technical colleges are far lower than desirable to ensure that students may utilize the opportunities of postsecondary education to lift themselves and their families out of poverty and to meet our state's student achievement council road map goals, including for 70 percent of Washington residents to have a postsecondary certification or degree to meet workforce needs. The legislature recognizes that first-generation college-attending students and underrepresented minority students face far greater obstacles to apply, remain in school, and complete programs. This disparate impact greatly affects our state's commitment to equity.

The legislature recognizes that offering tuition financial support to first-generation and underrepresented minority students is necessary for students to enroll and attend college but must also be accompanied by proven supports for them to complete their degrees or workforce training programs.

The legislature recognizes that there are mentorship and advising programs based on strong evidence that have been proven to be successful in greatly increasing retention and degree or workforce training completion rates for first-generation students, underrepresented minority students, and for all students at community and technical colleges. It is the legislature's intent that successful programs such as guided pathways, integrated basic education skills and training, and mentoring programs along with improved advising for students be implemented at all community and technical colleges with the goal of doubling completion rates (as measured by completion in six years) for students in the next eight years. To accomplish this goal, the legislature intends that all students receiving Washington college grants, college bound scholarships, or federal Pell grants should receive the supports, including mentoring, that have been proven to increase completion rates.

The legislature recognizes the success of the City University of New York's accelerated study in associate programs, also known as ASAP. The accelerated study in associate programs' goal is to have at least 50 percent of students earn an associate degree within three years by removing barriers to completion with financial and comprehensive academic supports. The program began in 2007 at six City University of New York colleges with a little over 1,000 students. Today, the program has expanded to nine colleges with over 22,000 students with consistent results. In addition, the program has been replicated at other colleges in Ohio, California, and New York. To date, the accelerated study in associate programs average three-year graduation rate is 53 percent. The 2013 national three-year graduation rate for public two-year colleges was just 19 percent and Washington's graduation rate was just under 29 percent. The MDRC, a nonprofit nonpartisan research organization, evaluated the impacts of the accelerated study in associate programs with a random assignment design and found that the program doubled graduation rates, which was the largest effect MDRC has found in any of its evaluations of community college reforms. In addition, MDRC found that at the three-year point, the cost per degree was lower for the accelerated study in associate programs because the program generated so many additional graduates. The legislature intends for all students who receive Washington college grants, college bound scholarships, or Pell grants to receive the supports under this act and related programs in order to enable them to remain enrolled and complete their programs in a reasonable period of time.

The legislature further finds that research establishes that students from underrepresented minorities are far more likely to complete degrees or workforce training certification programs if the faculty and staff of the college reflect the diversity of the student body. Therefore, the legislature intends for the state's community and technical colleges to develop and implement plans to increase faculty and staff diversity.


## Section 2
The legislature finds that there is a need to expand investments in community and technical colleges for the purpose of guaranteeing both equitable access and educational success for all residents of the state, particularly for students from communities of color and low-income communities. The legislature finds further that equality of opportunity for all students requires investments to support services that are critical to: The success of students of color and low-income students; provide systemwide equity initiatives intended to make community and technical college campuses welcoming, benevolent places; overcome the digital divide for all students; and provide qualified and available counseling throughout the community and technical college system. The legislature also finds that a more full-time, stable, fairly compensated, and diverse community and technical college faculty is necessary to enhance student success and to improve the mentoring available for a diverse student body. The legislature also finds that resources for student aid and workforce investment need to be adequate to meet the needs of all students in the state, particularly those from families of color and low-income families.


## Section 3
1. Beginning July 30, 2022, all community and technical colleges must submit, on an annual basis, strategic plans to the state board for community and technical colleges for achieving diversity, equity, and inclusion on their campuses.

2. Colleges must create their strategic plans using an inclusive process of stakeholders including, but not limited to, classified staff, faculty, administrative exempt staff, students, and community organizations. Colleges are encouraged to use campus climate surveys to develop and update strategic plans for diversity, equity, and inclusion. The state board for community and technical colleges shall develop a model campus climate survey tool relating to diversity, equity, and inclusion, and may contract for carrying out surveys at individual colleges.

3. In addition to planning, each community and technical college shall include in its diversity program opportunities for students from diverse communities to form student-based organizations, and to use community-based organizations, that permit students to work together to mentor and assist one another in navigating the educational system and to access trained mentors using evidence-based mentoring strategies.

4. Each community and technical college shall establish a culturally appropriate outreach program to communities of color and low-income communities designed to assist potential students to understand the opportunities available in the community and technical college system and to assist with navigating the student aid system. Outreach programs shall include partnerships with appropriate community-based organizations and use research and supports from the student achievement council.

5. Colleges may request funds from the state board for community and technical colleges to implement and maintain their strategic plan. A college's request for funds to implement and maintain its strategic plan must include funding for staff whose primary responsibilities are to implement and monitor the effectiveness of the strategic plan.

6. A college's overhead costs to implement the strategic plan may not exceed five percent of the funds allocated to the college for implementation of the strategic plan.

7. Each college shall assess its progress towards meeting the goals of diversity, equity, and inclusion. The assessment must detail progress on each goal, describe obstacles encountered, prioritize goals in the strategic plan for the following year, and identify resources needed for continued progress.


## Section 4
In order to improve the degree and workforce certification completion rates for students receiving Washington college grants, college bound scholarships, opportunity scholarships, or federal Pell grants, each community and technical college shall establish for implementation in the 2023-24 academic year a student success support program using programs that the state board for community and technical colleges, in consultation with the student achievement council, finds have been effective to improve student completion rates for students of similar backgrounds to those attending each community and technical college and that include:

1. A student success support program that is either a credit-based class, orientation program, or peer mentoring program that is based on research or documented evidence of success at other institutions with comparable student populations.

## Section 5
1. By December 1, 2023, each community and technical college shall establish a faculty diversity program designed to provide for the retention and recruitment of faculty from diverse racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds. The program must meet minimum standards established by the state board for community and technical colleges.

2. The standards for faculty diversity programs under this section developed by the state board for community and technical colleges must be based on the 17 steps for diversity and equity in hiring and professional development in the hiring process developed by the collective of professionals from the Washington state community and technical colleges. In developing the standards, the state board for community and technical colleges must also consider model faculty diversity programs from other institutions, including recommended methods for mentoring students, staff, and members of the community to become faculty in the system. The standards must also include requirements for consultation with students from diverse backgrounds and faculty bargaining representatives in their development and implementation.

Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the plan must be implemented in phases, with the first phase-in of the plan to begin in the fall quarter of 2024. The state board for community and technical colleges must develop this systemwide plan in collaboration with academic employee collective bargaining representatives. To support the state board for community and technical colleges' planning process, each community and technical college district must develop, in collaboration with academic employee bargaining representatives at the college, a college-level plan to achieve these goals at each college and provide it to the state board for community and technical colleges by November 1, 2023.

2. The first priority for the plans must be the faculty in programs that provide basic education for adults. The required 70 percent ratio of full-time to part-time faculty for instructors in the basic education for adults program must be achieved by the 2026 academic year.

3. The plan must: Include as nontenure-track faculty all academic employees who are not tenured or on the tenure track, including all associate, adjunct, contingent, and part-time faculty; create new, full-time tenure-track faculty positions and more opportunities for nontenure-track faculty; and include as part of the planning process open public meetings to ensure inclusion of student and community member perspectives and ideas.

4. The state board for community and technical colleges shall report to the higher education committees of the legislature by December 1, 2024, and by December 1st every two years thereafter until 2030 regarding phase-in of the systemwide plan required by this section and information regarding the systemwide plan and each college's progress in achieving the plan.

5. The standards used in this section to determine equal-pay-for-equal-work must be based on the instructional work of the faculty, including direct student support, time in class, preparation for class, grading and assessment, and office hours equivalent to those required for full-time tenure-track faculty under the relevant collective bargaining agreement.

6. For the purposes of this section, "academic employee" has the same meaning as in RCW 28B.50.489.


## Section 7
1. Beginning the fall academic quarter of 2021, every community and technical college must have and maintain a staffing ratio of no more than 900 aid-eligible students to one full-time equivalent faculty counselor, based on the previous fall quarter's unduplicated student head count.

2. The ratio required under this section applies to counselor positions that are state-funded. Counselor positions that are funded by sources other than state funds may not be counted when determining if a community or technical college has met the student-to-counselor ratio requirement.

3. The state board for community and technical colleges shall include data on each community and technical college's student-to-counselor ratio in its annual fall quarter enrollment and staffing report.

    a. Beginning with business activities occurring on or after April 1, 2020, in addition to the taxes imposed under RCW 82.04.290(2), a workforce education investment surcharge is imposed on select advanced computing businesses. The surcharge is equal to the gross income of the business subject to the tax under RCW 82.04.290(2), multiplied by the rate of 1.22 percent.

    b.

For persons subject to the surcharge imposed under this subsection (1) that report under one or more tax classifications, the surcharge applies only to business activities taxed under RCW 82.04.290(2).

    c. The surcharge imposed under this subsection (1) must be reported and paid on a quarterly basis in a manner as required by the department. Returns and amounts payable under this subsection (1) are due by the last day of the month immediately following the end of the reporting period covered by the return. All other taxes must be reported and paid as required under RCW 82.32.045.

    d. [Empty]

        i. To aid in the effective administration of the surcharge in this subsection (1), the department may require persons believed to be engaging in advanced computing or affiliated with a person believed to be engaging in advanced computing to disclose whether they are a member of an affiliated group and, if so, to identify all other members of the affiliated group subject to the surcharge.

        ii. If the department establishes, by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence, that one or more members of an affiliated group, with intent to evade the surcharge under this subsection (1), failed to fully comply with this subsection (1)(d), the department must assess against that person, or those persons collectively, a penalty equal to fifty percent of the amount of the total surcharge payable by all members of that affiliated group for the calendar year during which the person or persons failed to fully comply with this subsection (1)(d). The penalty under this subsection (1)(d) is in lieu of and not in addition to the evasion penalty under RCW 82.32.090(7).

    e. For the purposes of this subsection (1) the following definitions apply:

        i. "Advanced computing" means designing or developing computer software or computer hardware, whether directly or contracting with another person, including modifications to computer software or computer hardware, cloud computing services, or operating an online marketplace, an online search engine, or online social networking platform;

    vi. "Select advanced computing business" means a person who is a member of an affiliated group with at least one member of the affiliated group engaging in the business of advanced computing, and the affiliated group has worldwide gross revenue of more than twenty-five billion dollars during the immediately preceding calendar year. A person who is primarily engaged within this state in the provision of commercial mobile service, as that term is defined in 47 U.S.C. Sec. 332(d)(1), shall not be considered a select advanced computing business. A person who is primarily engaged in this state in the operation and provision of access to transmission facilities and infrastructure that the person owns or leases for the transmission of voice, data, text, sound, and video using wired telecommunications networks shall not be considered a select advanced computing business. A person that is primarily engaged in business as a "financial institution" as defined in RCW 82.04.29004, as that section existed on January 1, 2020, shall not be considered a select advanced computing business. For purposes of this subsection (1)(e)(vi), "primarily" is determined based on gross income of the business.

2. The workforce education investment surcharge under this section does not apply to any hospital as defined in RCW 70.41.020, including any hospital that comes within the scope of chapter 71.12 RCW if the hospital is also licensed under chapter 70.41 RCW.
