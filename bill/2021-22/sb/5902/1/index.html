<p>The state board of education shall establish high school graduation requirements or equivalencies for students, except as provided in RCW 28A.230.122 and 28A.655.250 and except those equivalencies established by local high schools or school districts under RCW 28A.230.097. The purpose of a high school diploma is to declare that a student is ready for success in postsecondary education, gainful employment, and citizenship, and is equipped with the skills to be a lifelong learner.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Any course in Washington state history and government used to fulfill high school graduation requirements shall consider including information on the culture, history, and government of the American Indian peoples who were the first inhabitants of the state.</li>

<p>Each student must have a high school and beyond plan to guide the student's high school experience and inform course taking that is aligned with the student's goals for education or training and career after high school <strong>under the provisions of section 2 of this act. Any decision on whether a student has met the state board's high school graduation requirements for a high school and beyond plan must be made at the local level. Effective with the graduating class of 2015, the state board of education may not establish a requirement for students to complete a culminating project for graduation. A district may establish additional local requirements for a high school and beyond plan to serve the needs and interests of its students and the purposes of this section</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>c. [Empty]

    i. The state board of education shall adopt rules to implement the career and college ready graduation requirement proposal adopted under board resolution on November 10, 2010, and revised on January 9, 2014, to take effect beginning with the graduating class of 2019 or as otherwise provided in this subsection (1)(c). The rules must include authorization for a school district to waive up to two credits for individual students based on a student's circumstances, provided that none of the waived credits are identified as mandatory core credits by the state board of education. School districts must adhere to written policies authorizing the waivers that must be adopted by each board of directors of a school district that grants diplomas.

    ii. School districts may apply to the state board of education for a waiver to implement the career and college ready graduation requirement proposal beginning with the graduating class of 2020 or 2021 instead of the graduating class of 2019. In the application, a school district must describe why the waiver is being requested, the specific impediments preventing timely implementation, and efforts that will be taken to achieve implementation with the graduating class proposed under the waiver. The state board of education shall grant a waiver under this subsection (1)(c) to an applying school district at the next subsequent meeting of the board after receiving an application.

    iii. (A) **The state board of education shall adopt rules, to take effect beginning with the graduating class of 2022, that incorporate, at a minimum, the following credit requirements for graduation:**
</code></pre>
<p>(I) <strong>Seven combined credits of social studies and English language arts, with no less than three credits in either social studies or English language arts;</strong></p>
<p>(II) <strong>Six combined credits of mathematics and science, with no less than two credits in either mathematics or science.</strong></p>
<p>(B) <strong>Rules adopted under this subsection (1)(c)(iii) may not increase the overall credit amount required for graduation established by rule making under (c)(i) of this subsection, nor does this subsection alter the graduation pathway options under RCW 28A.655.250.</strong></p>
<p>(C) <strong>The rules adopted under this subsection (1)(c)(iii) must also provide that the content of any credits beyond the first two credits in mathematics and the first two credits of science may be chosen by the student based on the student's interests and high school and beyond plan with the agreement of the student's parent or legal guardian, an agreement of the school counselor or principal, or as provided in RCW 28A.230.300(4).</strong></p>
<p>(D) <strong>In selecting courses to meet the graduation requirements under this subsection (1)(c)(iii), each student's high school and beyond plan must be updated to assess progress toward identified goals, and revised as necessary for changing interests, goals, and needs, as required under section 2(2)(a) of this act. The school counselor or other designated staff must also document and provide the student and student's parent or legal guardian with notification of the impacts of the credit selection on postsecondary opportunities</strong>.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>In recognition of the statutory authority of the state board of education to establish and enforce minimum high school graduation requirements, the state board shall periodically reevaluate the graduation requirements and shall <strong>forward any proposed changes to the high school graduation requirements to the education committees of the legislature for review. The legislature shall have the opportunity to act during a regular legislative session before the changes are adopted through administrative rule by the state board. Changes that have a fiscal impact on school districts, as identified by a fiscal analysis prepared by the office of the superintendent of public instruction, shall take effect only if formally authorized and funded by the legislature through the omnibus operating appropriations act or other enacted legislation</strong>.</p>

<li>
<p>Pursuant to any requirement for instruction in languages other than English established by the state board of education or a local school district, or both, for purposes of high school graduation, students who receive instruction in American sign language or one or more American Indian languages shall be considered to have satisfied the state or local school district graduation requirement for instruction in one or more languages other than English.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless requested otherwise by the student and the student's family, a student who has completed high school courses before attending high school shall be given high school credit which shall be applied to fulfilling high school graduation requirements if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The course was taken with high school students, if the academic level of the course exceeds the requirements for seventh and eighth grade classes, and the student has successfully passed by completing the same course requirements and examinations as the high school students enrolled in the class; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The academic level of the course exceeds the requirements for seventh and eighth grade classes and the course would qualify for high school credit, because the course is similar or equivalent to a course offered at a high school in the district as determined by the school district board of directors.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who have taken and successfully completed high school courses under the circumstances in subsection (4) of this section shall not be required to take an additional competency examination or perform any other additional assignment to receive credit.</p>

<li>
<p>Beginning with the class of 2020, except as provided in RCW 28A.230.320, graduation from a public high school and the earning of a high school diploma must include the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Satisfying the graduation requirements established by the state board of education under RCW 28A.230.090 and any graduation requirements established by the applicable public high school or school district;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Satisfying credit requirements for graduation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demonstrating career and college readiness through completion of the high school and beyond plan as required by <strong>section 2 of this act</strong>; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meeting the requirements of at least one graduation pathway option established in this section. The pathway options established in this section are intended to provide a student with multiple pathways to graduating with a meaningful high school diploma that are tailored to the goals of the student. A student may choose to pursue one or more of the pathway options under (b) of this subsection, but any pathway option used by a student to demonstrate career and college readiness must be in alignment with the student's high school and beyond plan.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following graduation pathway options may be used to demonstrate career and college readiness in accordance with (a)(iv) of this subsection:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Meet or exceed the graduation standard established by the state board of education under RCW 28A.305.130 on the statewide high school assessments in English language arts and mathematics as provided for under RCW 28A.655.070;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete and qualify for college credit in dual credit courses in English language arts and mathematics. For the purposes of this subsection, &quot;dual credit course&quot; means a course in which a student qualifies for college and high school credit in English language arts or mathematics upon successfully completing the course;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Earn high school credit in a high school transition course in English language arts and mathematics, an example of which includes a bridge to college course. For the purposes of this subsection (1)(b)(iii), &quot;high school transition course&quot; means an English language arts or mathematics course offered in high school where successful completion by a high school student ensures the student college-level placement at participating institutions of higher education as defined in RCW 28B.10.016. High school transition courses must satisfy core or elective credit graduation requirements established by the state board of education. A student's successful completion of a high school transition course does not entitle the student to be admitted to an institution of higher education as defined in RCW 28B.10.016;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Earn high school credit, with a C+ grade, or receiving a three or higher on the AP exam, or equivalent, in AP, international baccalaureate, or Cambridge international courses in English language arts and mathematics; or receiving a four or higher on international baccalaureate exams. For English language arts, successfully completing any of the following courses meets the standard: AP English language and composition literature, macroeconomics, microeconomics, psychology, United States history, world history, United States government and politics, or comparative government and politics; or any of the international baccalaureate individuals and societies courses. For mathematics, successfully completing any of the following courses meets the standard: AP statistics, computer science, computer science principles, or calculus; or any of the international baccalaureate mathematics courses;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meet or exceed the scores established by the state board of education for the mathematics portion and the reading, English, or writing portion of the SAT or ACT;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="i" start="6">
<li>
<p>Meet any combination of at least one English language arts option and at least one mathematics option established in (b)(i) through (v) of this subsection (1);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meet standard in the armed services vocational aptitude battery; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete a sequence of career and technical education courses that are relevant to a student's postsecondary pathway, including those leading to workforce entry, state or nationally approved apprenticeships, or postsecondary education, and that meet either: The curriculum requirements of core plus programs for aerospace, maritime, health care, information technology, or construction and manufacturing; or the minimum criteria identified in RCW 28A.700.030. Nothing in this subsection (1)(b)(viii) requires a student to enroll in a preparatory course that is approved under RCW 28A.700.030 for the purposes of demonstrating career and college readiness under this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the legislature encourages school districts to make all pathway options established in this section available to their high school students, and to expand their pathway options until that goal is met, school districts have discretion in determining which pathway options under this section they will offer to students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state board of education shall adopt rules to implement the graduation pathway options established in this section.</p>
</li>
