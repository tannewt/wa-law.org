<h2 id="section-1-239">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-239">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing our state and the world today, an existential crisis with major negative impacts on environmental and human health. Washington is experiencing environmental and community impacts due to climate change through increasingly devastating wildfires, flooding, droughts, rising temperatures and sea levels, and ocean acidification. Greenhouse gas emissions already in the atmosphere will increase impacts for some period of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2020, the legislature updated the state's greenhouse gas emissions limits that are to be achieved by 2030, 2040, and 2050, based on current science and emissions trends, to support local and global efforts to avoid the most significant impacts from climate change. While these limits beneficially guide the implementation of all other state laws and policies that have an impact on greenhouse gas emissions in the state, meeting these limits will require coordinated, comprehensive, and multisectoral implementation of policies, programs, and laws, as currently enacted systems approaches are insufficient to meet the limits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that while climate change is a global problem, there are communities that have historically borne the disproportionate impacts of environmental burdens and that now bear the disproportionate negative impacts of climate change. Although the state has done great work in the past to highlight these environmental health disparities, beginning with senator Rosa Franklin's environmental equity study, and continuing through the work of the governor's interagency council on health disparities, the creation of the Washington environmental health disparities map, and recommendations of the environmental justice task force, the state can do much more to ensure that state programs address environmental equity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that while enacted carbon policies can be well-intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide environmental benefits to communities, the policies may not do enough to ensure environmental health disparities are reduced and environmental benefits are provided to those communities most impacted by environmental harms from greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, in establishing a program to ensure that the state's 2030, 2040, and 2050 greenhouse gas emissions limits are achieved, the legislature intends to ensure that overburdened communities and vulnerable populations are no longer overlooked in the establishment of environmental policies. Under the program, the legislature intends to identify overburdened communities where the highest concentrations of greenhouse gas emissions and criteria pollutants occur, determine the sources of those emissions and pollutants, and ensure that emissions or concentration reductions are achieved in those communities. The legislature further intends to conduct an environmental justice assessment to ensure that funds and programs created under this chapter provide direct and meaningful benefits to vulnerable populations and overburdened communities. The legislature further intends to establish an environmental justice and equity advisory panel to provide recommendations for the development and implementation of the program, the distribution of funds, and the establishment of programs, activities, and projects to achieve environmental justice and environmental health goals. The legislature further intends to create and adopt community engagement plans and tribal consultation frameworks in the administration of the program to ensure equitable practices for meaningful community and federally recognized tribal involvement. Finally, the legislature intends to establish this program to contribute to a healthy environment for all of Washington's communities.</p>

<p>The department shall commence the program by January 1, 2023, by determining an emissions baseline establishing the proportionate share that the total greenhouse gas emissions of covered entities for the first compliance period bears to the total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in the state during 2015 through 2019, based on data reported to the department under RCW 70A.15.2200 or provided as required by this chapter. By October 1, 2022, the department shall adopt a program budget of allowances for the first compliance period of the program, calendar years 2023 through 2026, to be distributed from January 1, 2023, through December 31, 2026.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By October 1, 2026, the department shall add to its emissions baseline by incorporating the proportionate share that the total greenhouse gas emissions of new covered entities in the second compliance period bear to the total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in the state during 2023 through 2025. In determining the addition to the baseline, the department may exclude a year from the determination if the department identifies that year to have been an outlier due to a state of emergency. The department shall adopt a program budget of allowances for the second compliance period of the program, calendar years 2027 through 2030, that will be incorporated into the program budget of allowances for the first compliance period of the program to be distributed from January 1, 2027, through December 31, 2030.</p>

<li>
<p>The program budgets must be set to achieve the share of reductions by covered entities necessary to achieve the 2030, 2040, and 2050 statewide emissions limits established in RCW 70A.45.020, based on data reported to the department under chapter 70A.15 RCW or provided as required by this chapter. The department must adopt annual allowance budgets for the program on a calendar year basis that provide for substantially equivalent reductions on an absolute basis for each year. An allowance distributed under the program, either directly by the department under sections 12 through 14 of this act or though auctions under section 11 of this act, does not expire and may be held or banked consistent with sections 11(6) and 16(1) of this act.</p>

<li>
<p>The department must complete an evaluation by December 31, 2028, and by December 31, 2035, of the performance of the program, including its performance in reducing greenhouse gases and criteria pollutants in overburdened communities. If the evaluation shows that adjustments to the annual budgets are necessary to ensure achievement of 2030 and 2040 emission reduction limits identified in RCW 70A.45.020 and reduce greenhouse gases and criteria pollutants in overburdened communities, the department shall adjust the annual budgets accordingly. The department must complete additional evaluations by December 31, 2040, and by December 31, 2045, of the performance of the program, and make adjustments in the annual budgets to ensure achievement of 2050 emission reduction limits identified in RCW 70A.45.020. Nothing in this subsection precludes the department from making additional adjustments as necessary to ensure successful achievement of emission reduction limits. If any evaluation finds that greenhouse gases and criteria pollutants are not being reduced in overburdened communities, the department must also prioritize the adoption of air quality standards, emission standards, or emissions limitations on covered entities located in those areas.</p>

<p>By January 1, 2024, the department must adopt by rule objective criteria for both emissions' intensity and trade exposure for the purpose of identifying emissions-intensive, trade-exposed manufacturing businesses during the second compliance period of the program and subsequent compliance periods. A manufacturing business that can demonstrate to the department that it meets this criteria, whether or not it is listed in subsection (1)(a) through (i) of this section, is eligible for treatment as an emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industry and is eligible for free allocation of allowances as described in this section, and by the department by rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By July 1, 2024, the department must adopt rules for allocating allowances that must be transferred by those covered entities that the department determines are engaged in emissions-intensive, trade-exposed processes during the second compliance period of the program. The rules must establish a schedule for the second compliance period of the program that provides for a declining portion of the allocation to such covered entities that must be provided at no cost. By December 31, 2029, the department must adopt rules following the same process and requirements for 2031 through 2040. Both sets of rules may be amended to align with adjustments made under section 8 of this act.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rules adopted under this section may utilize a combined output-based and emissions intensity-based assessment benchmarking methodology for determining the allocation of allowances to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries. A covered entity or process with a lower emissions intensity benchmark may receive a larger allocation than other covered entities engaged in the same industry with higher emissions intensities. The rules must provide a means for attributing a covered entity's emissions to the manufacture of goods and requirements for providing pertinent records to verify the output data used to calculate the emissions intensity benchmark.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The annual allocation of allowances for direct distribution to an entity identified as emissions-intensive and trade-exposed in the second compliance period of the program must be equal to the sum of the annual goods-specific emissions calculation for the goods manufactured by the covered entity, multiplied by a percentage that is adjusted annually, as set forth in a schedule adopted by the department by rule. The schedule must result in an amount of annual allowances that a covered entity may receive under this section and from the allowance price containment reserve that declines annually by a constant amount proportionate to the decline in the amount of allowances available in annual allowance budgets pursuant to section 8 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall by rule provide for covered entities to apply to the department for an adjustment to the allocation for direct distribution of allowances. The department may grant the adjustment based on either:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A significant change in the emissions attributable to the manufacture of an individual good or goods in this state by a covered entity based on a finding by the department that an adjustment is necessary to accommodate for changes in the manufacturing process that have a material impact on emissions; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Significant changes to a covered entity's external competitive environment that result in a significant increase in leakage risk.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>To help ensure that the price of allowances remains sufficient to incentivize reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, the department must establish an emissions containment reserve and set an emissions containment reserve trigger price by rule. The price must be set at a reasonable amount above the auction floor price. The purpose of withholding allowances in the emissions containment reserve is to secure additional emissions reductions consistent with the greenhouse gas emissions limits in RCW 70A.45.020 in the event auction prices fall below the emissions containment reserve trigger price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the event that the emissions containment reserve trigger price is met during an auction, the department must automatically withhold allowances as needed. The department must convert and transfer any allowances that have been withheld from auction into the emissions containment reserve account.</p>
