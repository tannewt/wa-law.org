<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the 2020 legislature updated the state's greenhouse gas emissions limits that are to be achieved by 2030, 2040, and 2050, based on current science and emissions trends, but did not enact a comprehensive program to ensure that the emissions limits would be achieved. The greenhouse gas emissions limits established in RCW 70A.45.020 are not merely aspirational. Rather, they are intended to guide the implementation of all other state laws and policies that have an impact on greenhouse gas emissions in the state. Meeting the state's science-based, greenhouse gas emissions limits set forth in RCW 70A.45.020 will require coordinated, comprehensive, and multisectoral implementation of policies, programs, and laws. Furthermore, enacted state policies, programs, and laws are currently insufficient for Washington to meet the greenhouse gas emissions limits contained in RCW 70A.45.020. The 2021 state energy strategy developed pursuant to RCW 43.21F.090 provides a road map for decarbonizing the energy sectors of the economy, including transportation, buildings, industry, and electricity. However, the state lacks an effective regulatory, financial, and policy framework to prioritize, implement, and hold programs accountable for meeting the greenhouse gas emissions limits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that Washington is already experiencing environmental and community impacts due to climate change through increasingly devastating wildfires, flooding, droughts, rising temperatures and sea levels, and ocean acidification. Greenhouse gas emissions already in the atmosphere will increase impacts for some period of time. Actions to increase resilience of our communities and ecosystems can prevent and reduce impacts to communities and our environment and improve their ability to recover. Despite the requirement of RCW 70A.05.010 to develop an integrated climate change response strategy, implementing a comprehensive climate resilience strategy will require greater cross-agency coordination, strategic action, and investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that many natural disasters in Washington, such as flooding, wildfires, and drought, are exacerbated by climate change. In 2020, the office of the insurance commissioner's disaster resiliency work group recommended creation of a statewide disaster resilience office in the governor's office to better prepare and mitigate impacts from natural disasters through enhanced coordination. Duties suggested for the disaster resilience office included developing and administering a state resiliency strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that climate change is an environmental harm that threatens human health and access to clean air, safe drinking water, nutritious food, and shelter; and that vulnerable populations and overburdened communities experience a disproportionate, cumulative risk from environmental burdens, including climate change. Fossil fuel combustion is responsible for pollutants in addition to greenhouse gases, such as nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, benzene, particulate matter, and others that contribute to respiratory diseases like asthma and lung cancer, which compromise public health and shorten life expectancy. This pollution affects all Washingtonians, but falls disproportionately on low-income communities, communities of color, and the most vulnerable of our population. Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels will therefore contribute to improved air quality and improved public health outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that communities experiencing environmental health disparities and other burdens created by the disproportionate impacts of pollution are less able to adapt to or recover from climate change impacts. In 2020, the environmental justice task force stated that environmental equity will be achieved when no single group or community faces disadvantages in dealing with the effects of the climate crisis, pollution, environmental hazards, or environmental disasters. The environmental justice task force recommended measurable goals and model policies to: Improve government accountability to communities; incorporate environmental justice into government structures, systems, and policies; invest equitably; and improve environmental enforcement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington state is home to some of the world's most innovative companies, a highly skilled workforce, and important industries. As our state transitions away from a fossil fuel-based economy, we must do so in a way that protects these assets and allows our businesses and workforce to thrive. By implementing a comprehensive climate program that invests in clean and resilient infrastructure, we can reduce our state's greenhouse gas emissions while supporting good paying jobs. In doing so, we recognize that some industries are emissions-intensive and trade-exposed, and thus have the incentive to be energy efficient. These industries must be given special consideration enabling them to innovate, remain globally competitive, and ensure these industries and jobs remain in Washington.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2020, the legislature passed chapter 120, Laws of 2020 (Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill No. 2528), which requires that any state carbon program must support the policies stated in that act and must recognize the forest product industry's contribution to the state's climate response. Therefore, the legislature finds that a comprehensive climate program should include investing in industry sectors that act as sequesterers of carbon. It is stated as the policy of the state to support the complete forest products sector, which includes landowners, mills, bioenergy, pulp and paper, and the related harvesting and transportation infrastructure; and to utilize carbon accounting land use, land use change, and forestry reporting principles consistent with established reporting guidelines, such as those used by the intergovernmental panel on climate change and as used in the United States' national greenhouse gas reporting inventories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that additional statutory authority is needed in order to adopt certain emission standards to meet the greenhouse gas limits and implement a comprehensive climate program. In Association of Washington Business v. Washington Department of Ecology (No. 12 95885-8, January 16, 2020), the Washington supreme court held that certain regulations establishing emission standards for producers and distributors of fossil fuels were invalid because the department of ecology lacked sufficient statutory authority to establish emission standards for indirect emissions associated with the combustion of the fuel produced or distributed by those particular entities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to fully institutionalize and operationalize the greenhouse gas limits by expressly providing such authority under chapter 70A.15 RCW, the clean air act, to enact emission standards, and create a cap on greenhouse gas emissions, as part of a comprehensive state climate, energy, and resilience program. The purpose of this program is to meet Washington state's commitment to its present and future generations to fully address the climate crisis by achieving the state's greenhouse gas limits in RCW 70A.45.020, improving our resilience to climate change impacts, and ensuring an equitable and inclusive transition to a carbon-neutral economy by 2050.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that the programs authorized by this act be implemented in a manner that is consistent with the recommendations of the environmental justice task force, and in consultation with tribal governments; be implemented alongside the clean fuels standard program established in chapter . . . (House Bill No. 1036), Laws of 2021, and other complementary policies and programs that reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with the consumption of fossil fuels and electricity in the state; and support investments in clean transportation, natural climate resilience solutions, clean energy transition and assistance, and emissions reduction projects that prioritize the equitable distribution of benefits to vulnerable populations and overburdened communities.</p>

<p>By January 1, 2024, the department must adopt by rule objective criteria for both emissions' intensity and trade exposure for the purpose of identifying emissions-intensive, trade-exposed manufacturing businesses during the second compliance period of the program and subsequent compliance periods. A manufacturing business that can demonstrate to the department that it meets this criteria, whether or not it is listed in subsection (1)(a) through (j) of this section, is eligible for treatment as an emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industry and is eligible for free allocation of allowances as described in this section, and by the department by rule.</p>

<p>Rules adopted under this section may utilize a combined output-based and emissions intensity-based assessment benchmarking methodology for determining the allocation of allowances to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries. A covered entity or process with a lower emissions intensity benchmark may receive a larger allocation than other covered entities engaged in the same industry with higher emissions intensities. The rules must provide a means for attributing a covered entity's emissions to the manufacture of goods and requirements for providing pertinent records to verify the output data used to calculate the emissions intensity benchmark.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/70A_environmental_health_and_safety/70A.015_washington_clean_air_act.html">70A.15.3000</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/70A_environmental_health_and_safety/70A.015_washington_clean_air_act.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The department shall have all the powers as provided in RCW 70A.15.2040.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department, in addition to any other powers vested in it by law after consideration at a public hearing held in accordance with chapters 42.30 and 34.05 RCW shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Adopt rules establishing air quality objectives and air quality standards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adopt emission standards which shall constitute minimum emission standards throughout the state. An authority may enact more stringent emission standards, except for emission performance standards for new woodstoves and opacity levels for residential solid fuel burning devices which shall be statewide, but in no event may less stringent standards be enacted by an authority without the prior approval of the department after public hearing and due notice to interested parties;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adopt by rule air quality standards and emission standards for the control or prohibition of emissions to the outdoor atmosphere of radionuclides, dust, fumes, mist, smoke, other particulate matter, vapor, gas, odorous substances, or any combination thereof. Such requirements may be based upon a system of classification by types of emissions or types of sources of emissions, or combinations thereof, which it determines most feasible for the purposes of this chapter. <strong>The department may require persons who produce or distribute fossil fuels or other products that emit greenhouse gases in Washington to comply with air quality standards, emission standards, or emission limitations on emissions of greenhouse gases. If the program review in section 6(2) of this act finds that greenhouse gases and criteria pollutants are not being reduced in communities identified as highly impacted by the department of health's environmental health disparities map, then, as a means of ensuring that the program created in sections 5 through 18 of this act achieves reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and other criteria pollutants in overburdened communities highly impacted by pollution, the department shall prioritize the adoption of air quality standards, emission standards, or emission limitations on fuel suppliers or covered entities located in those areas.</strong> However, an industry, or the air pollution control authority having jurisdiction, can choose, subject to the submittal of appropriate data that the industry has quantified, to have any limit on the opacity of emissions from a source whose emission standard is stated in terms of a weight of particulate per unit volume of air (e.g., grains per dry standard cubic foot) be based on the applicable particulate emission standard for that source, such that any violation of the opacity limit accurately indicates a violation of the applicable particulate emission standard. Any alternative opacity limit provided by this section that would result in increasing air contaminants emissions in any nonattainment area shall only be granted if equal or greater emission reductions are provided for by the same source obtaining the revised opacity limit. A reasonable fee may be assessed to the industry to which the alternate opacity standard would apply. The fee shall cover only those costs to the air pollution control authority which are directly related to the determination on the acceptability of the alternate opacity standard, including testing, oversight and review of data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The air quality standards and emission standards may be for the state as a whole or may vary from area to area or source to source, except that emission performance standards for new woodstoves and opacity levels for residential solid fuel burning devices shall be statewide, as may be appropriate to facilitate the accomplishment of the objectives of this chapter and to take necessary or desirable account of varying local conditions of population concentration, the existence of actual or reasonably foreseeable air pollution, topographic and meteorologic conditions and other pertinent variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department is directed to cooperate with the appropriate agencies of the United States or other states or any interstate agencies or international agencies with respect to the control of air pollution and air contamination, or for the formulation for the submission to the legislature of interstate air pollution control compacts or agreements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department is directed to conduct or cause to be conducted a continuous surveillance program to monitor the quality of the ambient atmosphere as to concentrations and movements of air contaminants and conduct or cause to be conducted a program to determine the quantity of emissions to the atmosphere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall enforce the air quality standards and emission standards throughout the state except where a local authority is enforcing the state regulations or its own regulations which are more stringent than those of the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall encourage local units of government to handle air pollution problems within their respective jurisdictions; and, on a cooperative basis provide technical and consultative assistance therefor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall have the power to require the addition to or deletion of a county or counties from an existing authority in order to carry out the purposes of this chapter. No such addition or deletion shall be made without the concurrence of any existing authority involved. Such action shall only be taken after a public hearing held pursuant to the provisions of chapter 34.05 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall establish rules requiring sources or source categories to apply reasonable and available control methods. Such rules shall apply to those sources or source categories that individually or collectively contribute the majority of statewide air emissions of each regulated pollutant. The department shall review, and if necessary, update its rules every five years to ensure consistency with current reasonable and available control methods. The department shall have adopted rules required under this subsection for all sources by July 1, 1996.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;reasonable and available control methods&quot; shall include but not be limited to, changes in technology, processes, or other control strategies.</p>
