<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The activities authorized by this chapter will require collaboration among state agencies and local governments that are involved in health care, private health carriers, third-party purchasers, health care providers, and hospitals. These activities will identify strategies to increase the quality and effectiveness of health care delivered in Washington state and are therefore in the best interest of the public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The benefits of collaboration, together with active state supervision, outweigh potential adverse impacts. Therefore, the legislature intends to exempt from state antitrust laws, and provide immunity through the state action doctrine from federal antitrust laws, activities that are undertaken, reviewed, and approved by the authority pursuant to this chapter that might otherwise be constrained by such laws. The legislature does not intend and does not authorize any person or entity to engage in activities not provided for by this chapter, and the legislature neither exempts nor provides immunity for such activities including, but not limited to, agreements among competing providers or carriers to set prices or specific levels of reimbursement for health care services.</p>

<li>
<p>The office shall establish a statewide all-payer health care claims database. On January 1, 2020, the office must transfer authority and oversight for the database to the authority. The office and authority must develop a transition plan that sustains operations by July 1, 2019. The database shall support transparent public reporting of health care information. The database must improve transparency to: Assist patients, providers, and hospitals to make informed choices about care; enable providers, hospitals, and communities to improve by benchmarking their performance against that of others by focusing on best practices; enable purchasers to identify value, build expectations into their purchasing strategy, and reward improvements over time; and promote competition based on quality and cost. The database must systematically collect all medical claims and pharmacy claims from private and public payers, with data from all settings of care that permit the systematic analysis of health care delivery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority shall use a competitive procurement process, in accordance with chapter 39.26 RCW, to select a lead organization from among the best potential bidders to coordinate and manage the database.</p>
