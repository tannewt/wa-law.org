<blockquote>
<p>This section adds a new section to an existing chapter <a href="/rcw/51_industrial_insurance/51.32_compensation%E2%80%94right_to_and_amount.html">51.32</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/51_industrial_insurance/51.32_compensation%E2%80%94right_to_and_amount.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Where an appealing party, other than the department or a self-insured employer, is ordered to pay attorneys' fees and costs and that party fails, refuses, or neglects to comply with the award, which has become final and is not subject to review or appeal, the director or any person entitled to compensation under the order may institute proceedings for injunctive or other appropriate relief for enforcement of the order. These proceedings may be instituted in the superior court for the county in which the claimant resides, or, if the claimant is not then a resident of this state, in the superior court for the county in which that party may be served with process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court shall ensure compliance to the order by proper means, enjoining compliance upon the person obligated to comply with the compensation order. The court may issue such writs and processes as are necessary to carry out its orders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A proceeding under this section does not preclude other methods of enforcement provided for in this title.</p>
</li>
