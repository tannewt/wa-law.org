<h2 id="section-1-1058">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1058">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the success of persons with behavioral health needs being released from confinement in a prison, jail, juvenile rehabilitation facility, state hospital, and other state and local institutions can be increased with access to continuity of medical assistance, supportive services, and other targeted assistance. The legislature finds that this act provides strategies to prevent interruption of medical assistance benefits and to allow for a seamless transfer between systems of care. The legislature further finds that this act removes stigmatizing language from the program created under RCW 72.09.370 and 71.24.470 and creates a work group to study how to expand the cost-effective strategies of this program to other populations and settings to enhance recovery, reduce recidivism, and improve safety.</p>

<p>The authority shall adopt rules and policies providing that when persons  who were enrolled in medical assistance immediately prior to confinement, <strong>or who become enrolled in medical assistance in suspense status during the period of confinement,</strong> are released from confinement, their medical assistance coverage <strong>shall</strong> be fully reinstated <strong>no later than at the moment</strong> of their release, subject to any expedited review of their continued eligibility for medical assistance coverage that is required under federal or state law. <strong>The authority may reinstate medical assistance prior to the day of release provided that no federal funds are expended for any purpose that is not authorized by the state's agreements with the federal government.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority, in collaboration with the Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs, the department of corrections, <strong>the department of children, youth, and families,</strong> managed care organizations, and behavioral health administrative services organizations, shall establish procedures for coordination between the authority and department field offices, institutions for mental disease, and correctional institutions, as defined in RCW 9.94.049, that result in prompt reinstatement of eligibility and speedy eligibility determinations for  medical assistance services upon release from confinement. Procedures developed under this subsection must address:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Mechanisms for receiving medical assistance services applications on behalf of confined persons in anticipation of their release from confinement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expeditious review of applications filed by or on behalf of confined persons and, to the extent practicable, completion of the review before the person is released;</p>
</li>

<p>Mechanisms for providing medical assistance services identity cards to persons eligible for medical assistance services <strong>before</strong> their release from confinement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coordination with the federal social security administration, through interagency agreements or otherwise, to expedite processing of applications for federal supplemental security income or social security disability benefits, including federal acceptance of applications on behalf of confined persons**; and**</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assuring that notification of the person's release date, current location, and other appropriate information is provided to the person's managed care organization at least 30 days before the person's scheduled release from confinement, or as soon as practicable thereafter</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where medical or psychiatric examinations during a person's confinement indicate that the person is disabled, the correctional institution or institution for mental diseases shall provide the authority with that information for purposes of making medical assistance eligibility and enrollment determinations prior to the person's release from confinement. The authority shall, to the maximum extent permitted by federal law, use the examination in making its determination whether the person is disabled and eligible for medical assistance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section, &quot;confined&quot; or &quot;confinement&quot; means incarcerated in a correctional institution, as defined in RCW 9.94.049, or admitted to an institute for mental disease, as defined in 42 C.F.R. part 435, Sec. 1009 on July 24, 2005.</p>

<p>The health care authority shall apply for a waiver allowing the state to provide medicaid services to persons who are confined in a correctional institution as defined in RCW 9.94.049 or confined in a state hospital or other treatment facility up to 30 days prior to the person's release or discharge to the community. The purpose is to create continuity of care and provide reentry services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The health care authority shall consult with the work group established under section 9 of this act about how to optimize the waiver application and its chance of success, including by limiting its scope if deemed appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The health care authority shall inform the governor and relevant committees of the legislature in writing when the waiver application is submitted and update them as to progress of the waiver at appropriate points.</p>

<p>The  reentry community <strong>services</strong> program is established to provide intensive services to <strong>persons</strong> identified under this subsection and to thereby promote <strong>successful reentry,</strong> public safety**, and recovery**. The secretary shall identify <strong>persons</strong> in confinement or partial confinement who: (a) Are reasonably believed to <strong>present a danger</strong> to themselves or others <strong>if released to the community without supportive services</strong>; and (b) have a mental disorder. In <strong>evaluating these criteria</strong>, the secretary shall consider behavior known to the department and factors, based on research, that are linked to risk <strong>of</strong> dangerousness <strong>for persons</strong> with mental illnesses <strong>within the criminal justice system</strong> and shall include consideration of <strong>the person's history of</strong> substance use disorder or abuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to release of <strong>a person</strong> identified under this section, a team consisting of representatives of the department of corrections, the health care authority, and, as necessary, the indeterminate sentence review board, divisions or administrations within the department of social and health services, specifically including the division of developmental disabilities, the appropriate managed care organization <strong>or</strong> behavioral health administrative services organization, and <strong>reentry community services</strong> providers, as appropriate, shall develop a plan, as determined necessary by the team, for delivery of treatment and support services to the <strong>person</strong> upon release. In developing the plan, the <strong>person</strong> shall be offered assistance in executing a mental health <strong>advance</strong> directive under chapter 71.32 RCW, after being fully informed of the benefits, scope, and purposes of such directive. The team may include a school district representative for <strong>persons</strong> under the age of <strong>21</strong>. The team shall consult with the <strong>person's</strong> counsel, if any, and, as appropriate, the <strong>person's</strong> family and community. The team shall notify the crime victim/witness program, which shall provide notice to all people registered to receive notice under RCW 72.09.712 of the proposed release plan developed by the team. Victims, witnesses, and other interested people notified by the department may provide information and comments to the department on potential safety risk to specific individuals or classes of individuals posed by the specific <strong>person</strong>. The team may recommend: (a) That the <strong>person</strong> be evaluated by <strong>a</strong> designated crisis responder, as defined in chapter 71.05 RCW; (b) department-supervised community treatment; or (c) voluntary community mental health or substance use disorder or abuse treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to release of <strong>a person</strong> identified under this section, the team shall determine whether or not an evaluation by a designated crisis responder is needed. If an evaluation is recommended, the supporting documentation shall be immediately forwarded to the appropriate designated crisis responder. The supporting documentation shall include the <strong>person's</strong> criminal history, history of judicially required or administratively ordered involuntary antipsychotic medication while in confinement, and any known history of involuntary civil commitment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an evaluation by a designated crisis responder is recommended by the team, such evaluation shall occur not more than ten days, nor less than five days, prior to release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A second evaluation by a designated crisis responder shall occur on the day of release if requested by the team, based upon new information or a change in the <strong>person's</strong> mental condition, and the initial evaluation did not result in an emergency detention or a summons under chapter 71.05 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the designated crisis responder determines an emergency detention under chapter 71.05 RCW is necessary, the department shall release the <strong>person</strong> only to a state hospital or to a consenting evaluation and treatment facility <strong>or secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility</strong>. The department shall arrange transportation of the <strong>person</strong> to the hospital or facility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the designated crisis responder believes that a less restrictive alternative treatment is appropriate, he or she shall seek a summons, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 71.05 RCW, to require the <strong>person</strong> to appear at an evaluation and treatment facility <strong>or secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility</strong>. If a summons is issued, the <strong>person</strong> shall remain within the corrections facility until completion of his or her term of confinement and be transported, by corrections personnel on the day of completion, directly to the identified  facility.</p>
