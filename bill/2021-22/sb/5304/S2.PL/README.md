# Engrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill 5304 as Recommended by Ways & Means - as passed by the Legislature

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/Senate%20Passed%20Legislature/5304-S2.PL.xml)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that when considering releasing persons from state and local institutions, realizing the safety of the public is the primary concern. The legislature also finds that the success of persons with behavioral health needs being released from confinement in a prison, jail, juvenile rehabilitation facility, state hospital, and other state and local institutions can be increased with access to continuity of medical assistance, supportive services, and other targeted assistance. The legislature finds that this act provides strategies to prevent interruption of medical assistance benefits and to allow for a seamless transfer between systems of care. The legislature further finds that this act removes stigmatizing language from the program created under RCW 72.09.370 and 71.24.470 and creates a work group to study how to expand the cost-effective strategies of this program to other populations and settings to enhance recovery, reduce recidivism, and improve safety.

## Section 2
> This section modifies existing section [74.09.670](/rcw/74_public_assistance/74.09_medical_care.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/74_public_assistance/74.09_medical_care.md) for context.

**When the authority receives information that a person enrolled in medical assistance is confined in a setting in which federal financial participation is disallowed by the state's agreements with the federal government, the** authority **shall** suspend, rather than terminate, medical assistance benefits  for **these** persons**, including those** who are incarcerated **in a correctional institution as defined in RCW 9.94.049,** or committed to a state hospital **or other treatment facility**. **A** person **who is not currently enrolled in medical assistance must be allowed** to apply for medical assistance in suspense status during **confinement**, and **the ability to apply** may not depend upon knowledge of the release **or discharge** date of the person.


## Section 3
> This section modifies existing section [74.09.555](/rcw/74_public_assistance/74.09_medical_care.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/74_public_assistance/74.09_medical_care.md) for context.

1. The authority shall adopt rules and policies providing that when persons  who were enrolled in medical assistance immediately prior to confinement, **or who become enrolled in medical assistance in suspense status during the period of confinement,** are released from confinement, their medical assistance coverage **shall** be fully reinstated **no later than at the moment** of their release, subject to any expedited review of their continued eligibility for medical assistance coverage that is required under federal or state law. **The authority may reinstate medical assistance prior to the day of release provided that no federal funds are expended for any purpose that is not authorized by the state's agreements with the federal government.**

2. The authority, in collaboration with the Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs, the department of corrections, **the department of children, youth, and families,** managed care organizations, and behavioral health administrative services organizations, shall establish procedures for coordination between the authority and department field offices, institutions for mental disease, and correctional institutions, as defined in RCW 9.94.049, that result in prompt reinstatement of eligibility and speedy eligibility determinations for  medical assistance services upon release from confinement. Procedures developed under this subsection must address:

    a. Mechanisms for receiving medical assistance services applications on behalf of confined persons in anticipation of their release from confinement;

    b. Expeditious review of applications filed by or on behalf of confined persons and, to the extent practicable, completion of the review before the person is released;

    c. Mechanisms for providing medical assistance services identity cards to persons eligible for medical assistance services **before** their release from confinement;

    d. Coordination with the federal social security administration, through interagency agreements or otherwise, to expedite processing of applications for federal supplemental security income or social security disability benefits, including federal acceptance of applications on behalf of confined persons**; and**

    e. **Assuring that notification of the person's release date, current location, and other appropriate information is provided to the person's managed care organization before the person's scheduled release from confinement, or as soon as practicable thereafter**.

3. Where medical or psychiatric examinations during a person's confinement indicate that the person is disabled, the correctional institution or institution for mental diseases shall provide the authority with that information for purposes of making medical assistance eligibility and enrollment determinations prior to the person's release from confinement. The authority shall, to the maximum extent permitted by federal law, use the examination in making its determination whether the person is disabled and eligible for medical assistance.

4. For purposes of this section, "confined" or "confinement" means incarcerated in a correctional institution, as defined in RCW 9.94.049, or admitted to an institute for mental disease, as defined in 42 C.F.R. part 435, Sec. 1009 on July 24, 2005.

5.

The economic services administration within the department shall adopt standardized statewide screening and application practices and forms designed to facilitate the application of a confined person  for medicaid.


## Section 4
(1) The health care authority shall apply for a waiver allowing the state to provide medicaid services to persons who are confined in a correctional institution as defined in RCW 9.94.049 or confined in a state hospital or other treatment facility up to 30 days prior to the person's release or discharge to the community. The purpose is to create continuity of care and provide reentry services.
(2) The health care authority shall consult with the work group established under section 9 of this act about how to optimize the waiver application and its chance of success, including by limiting its scope if deemed appropriate.
(3) The health care authority shall inform the governor and relevant committees of the legislature in writing when the waiver application is submitted and update them as to progress of the waiver at appropriate points.
(4) No provision of this section may be interpreted to require the health care authority to provide medicaid services to persons who are confined in a correctional institution, state hospital, or other treatment facility up to 30 days prior to the person's release or discharge unless the health care authority obtains final approval for its waiver application from the centers for medicare and medicaid services.

## Section 5
> This section modifies existing section [9.94.049](/rcw/09_crimes_and_punishments/9.094_prisoners—correctional_institutions.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/09_crimes_and_punishments/9.094_prisoners—correctional_institutions.md) for context.

1. For the purposes of this chapter, the term "correctional institution" means any place designated by law for the keeping of persons held in custody under process of law, or under lawful arrest, including state prisons, county and local jails, **juvenile detention centers,** and other facilities operated by the department of corrections**, department of children, youth, and families,** or local governmental units primarily for the purposes of punishment, correction, or rehabilitation following conviction **or adjudication** of a criminal offense.

2. For the purposes of RCW 9.94.043 and 9.94.045, "state correctional institution" means all state correctional facilities under the supervision of the secretary of the department of corrections used solely for the purpose of confinement of convicted felons.

1. The  reentry community **services** program is established to provide intensive services to **persons** identified under this subsection and to thereby promote **successful reentry,** public safety**, and recovery**. The secretary shall identify **persons** in confinement or partial confinement who: (a) Are reasonably believed to **present a danger** to themselves or others **if released to the community without supportive services**; and (b) have a mental disorder. In **evaluating these criteria**, the secretary shall consider behavior known to the department and factors, based on research, that are linked to risk **of** dangerousness **for persons** with mental illnesses **within the criminal justice system** and shall include consideration of **the person's history of** substance use disorder or abuse.

2. Prior to release of **a person** identified under this section, a team consisting of representatives of the department of corrections, the health care authority, and, as necessary, the indeterminate sentence review board, divisions or administrations within the department of social and health services, specifically including the division of developmental disabilities, the appropriate managed care organization **or** behavioral health administrative services organization, and **reentry community services** providers, as appropriate, shall develop a plan, as determined necessary by the team, for delivery of treatment and support services to the **person** upon release. In developing the plan, the **person** shall be offered assistance in executing a mental health **advance** directive under chapter 71.32 RCW, after being fully informed of the benefits, scope, and purposes of such directive. The team may include a school district representative for **persons** under the age of **21**. The team shall consult with the **person's** counsel, if any, and, as appropriate, the **person's** family and community. The team shall notify the crime victim/witness program, which shall provide notice to all people registered to receive notice under RCW 72.09.712 of the proposed release plan developed by the team. Victims, witnesses, and other interested people notified by the department may provide information and comments to the department on potential safety risk to specific individuals or classes of individuals posed by the specific **person**. The team may recommend: (a) That the **person** be evaluated by **a** designated crisis responder, as defined in chapter 71.05 RCW; (b) department-supervised community treatment; or (c) voluntary community mental health or substance use disorder or abuse treatment.

3. Prior to release of **a person** identified under this section, the team shall determine whether or not an evaluation by a designated crisis responder is needed. If an evaluation is recommended, the supporting documentation shall be immediately forwarded to the appropriate designated crisis responder. The supporting documentation shall include the **person's** criminal history, history of judicially required or administratively ordered involuntary antipsychotic medication while in confinement, and any known history of involuntary civil commitment.

4. If an evaluation by a designated crisis responder is recommended by the team, such evaluation shall occur not more than ten days, nor less than five days, prior to release.

5. A second evaluation by a designated crisis responder shall occur on the day of release if requested by the team, based upon new information or a change in the **person's** mental condition, and the initial evaluation did not result in an emergency detention or a summons under chapter 71.05 RCW.

6. If the designated crisis responder determines an emergency detention under chapter 71.05 RCW is necessary, the department shall release the **person** only to a state hospital or to a consenting evaluation and treatment facility **or secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility**. The department shall arrange transportation of the **person** to the hospital or facility.

7. If the designated crisis responder believes that a less restrictive alternative treatment is appropriate, he or she shall seek a summons, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 71.05 RCW, to require the **person** to appear at an evaluation and treatment facility **or secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility**. If a summons is issued, the **person** shall remain within the corrections facility until completion of his or her term of confinement and be transported, by corrections personnel on the day of completion, directly to the identified  facility.

8. The secretary shall adopt rules to implement this section.


## Section 7
> This section modifies existing section [71.24.470](/rcw/71_mental_illness/71.24_community_behavioral_health_services_act.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/71_mental_illness/71.24_community_behavioral_health_services_act.md) for context.

The contracts may be with any qualified and appropriate entities. **The director shall ensure the authority has coverage in all counties of the state for the purposes of providing reentry community services program services.**

2. The case manager has the authority to assist these **persons** in obtaining the services, as set forth in the plan created under RCW 72.09.370(2), for up to five years. The services may include coordination of mental health services, assistance with unfunded medical expenses, **assistance** obtaining substance use disorder treatment, housing, employment services, educational or vocational training, independent living skills, parenting education, anger management services, **peer services,** and such other services as the case manager deems necessary.

3. The legislature intends that funds appropriated for the purposes of RCW 72.09.370, 71.05.145, and 71.05.212, and this section are to supplement and not to supplant general funding. Funds appropriated to implement RCW 72.09.370, 71.05.145, and 71.05.212, and this section are not to be considered available resources as defined in RCW 71.24.025 and are not subject to the priorities, terms, or conditions in the appropriations act established pursuant to RCW 71.24.035.

## Section 8
> This section modifies existing section [71.24.480](/rcw/71_mental_illness/71.24_community_behavioral_health_services_act.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/71_mental_illness/71.24_community_behavioral_health_services_act.md) for context.

1. A licensed or certified behavioral health agency acting in the course of the **agency's** duties under this chapter**and its individual employees are** not liable for civil damages resulting from the injury or death of another caused by a participant in the  reentry community **services** program who is a client of the **agency**, unless the act or omission of the **agency or employee** constitutes:

    a. Gross negligence;

    b. Willful or wanton misconduct; or

    c. A breach of the duty to warn of and protect from a client's threatened violent behavior if the client has communicated a serious threat of physical violence against a reasonably ascertainable victim or victims.

2. In addition to any other requirements to report violations, the licensed or certified behavioral health agency shall report **a reentry community services program participant's** expressions of intent to harm or other predatory behavior, regardless of whether there is an ascertainable victim, in progress reports and other established processes that enable courts and supervising entities to assess and address the progress and appropriateness of treatment.

3. A licensed or certified behavioral health agency's mere act of treating a participant in the  reentry community **services** program is not negligence. Nothing in this subsection alters the licensed or certified behavioral health agency's normal duty of care with regard to the client.

4. The limited liability provided by this section applies only to the conduct of licensed or certified behavioral health agencies **and their employees** and does not apply to conduct of the state.

5. For purposes of this section, "participant in the  reentry community **services** program" means a person who has been identified under RCW 72.09.370 as **a person** who: (a) Is reasonably believed to **present a danger** to himself or herself or others **if released to the community without supportive services**; and (b) has a mental disorder.


## Section 10
The Washington state institute for public policy shall update its previous evaluations of the reentry community services program under RCW 72.09.370 and 71.24.470, and broaden its cost-benefit analysis to include impacts on the use of public services, and other factors. The institute shall collaborate with the work group established under section 9 of this act to determine research parameters and help the work group answer additional research questions including, but not limited to, the potential cost, benefit, and risks involved in expanding or replicating the reentry community services program; and what modifications to the program are most likely to prove advantageous based on the current state of knowledge about evidence-based, research-based, and promising programs. The department of corrections, health care authority, administrative office of the courts, King county, and department of social and health services must cooperate with the institute to facilitate access to data or other resources necessary to complete this work. The institute must provide a preliminary report by July 1, 2022, and a final report by November 1, 2023, to the governor and relevant committees of the legislature.

    b. **In implementing the provisions of this subsection, the department shall approve residence locations in a manner that will not cause any one county to be disproportionately impacted.**
