<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>According to the federal centers for disease control and prevention, over 12 percent of women of reproductive age in the United States have difficulty becoming pregnant or staying pregnant;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infertility is evenly divided between men and women and approximately one-third of cases involve both partners being diagnosed or are unexplained;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increasing accessibility for infertility treatment will expand the state's health services and improve the short and long-term health outcomes for the resulting children and mothers, which may also reduce health care costs by reducing adverse outcomes; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insurance coverage reduces disparities in access to care for racial and ethnic minorities as well as for LGBTQ persons.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature, therefore, intends to provide coverage for the diagnosis of and treatment for infertility, as well as for standard fertility preservation services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2-642">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-642">¶</a></h2>
