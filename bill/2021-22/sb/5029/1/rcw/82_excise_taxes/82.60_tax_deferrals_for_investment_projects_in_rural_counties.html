<p>The legislature finds that there are <strong>counties</strong> in the state that <strong>experience chronically high levels of unemployment and that state policies are necessary to promote economic stimulation and new employment opportunities in these counties</strong>. The legislature further finds that <strong>firms participating in a tax deferral program in high unemployment counties created more jobs and experienced higher levels of income growth than firms that did not participate in the deferral</strong>. For these reasons, the legislature reestablishes a tax deferral program to be effective solely in  counties <strong>experiencing high levels of unemployment</strong>. The legislature declares that this limited program serves the vital public purpose of creating employment opportunities and reducing poverty in  counties <strong>experiencing levels of unemployment that are higher than those</strong> of the state.</p>

<p>In addition to the provisions of <strong>section 4 of this act</strong>, the department shall issue a sales and use tax deferral certificate for state and local sales and use taxes due under chapters 82.08, 82.12, and 82.14 RCW, on each eligible investment project that is located in an eligible area, if the applicant establishes that at the time the project is operationally complete:</p>

<p>Subject to the conditions in this section, a person is not liable for the amount of deferred taxes outstanding for an investment project when the person temporarily ceases to use its qualified buildings and qualified machinery and equipment for manufacturing or research and development activities in a county with a population of less than twenty thousand persons for a period not to exceed twenty-four months from the date that the department sent its assessment for the amount of outstanding deferred taxes to the taxpayer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The relief from repayment of deferred taxes under this section does not apply unless the number of qualified employment positions maintained at the investment project after manufacturing or research and development activities are temporarily ceased is at least ten percent of the number of qualified employment positions employed at the investment project at the time the deferral was approved by the department. If a person has been approved for more than one deferral under this chapter, relief from repayment of deferred taxes under this section does not apply unless the number of qualified employment positions maintained at the investment project after manufacturing or research and development activities are temporarily ceased is at least ten percent of the highest number of qualified employment positions at the investment project at the time any of the deferrals were approved by the department. If, at any time during the twenty-four month period after the department has sent the taxpayer an assessment for outstanding deferred taxes resulting from the person temporarily ceasing to use its qualified buildings and qualified machinery and equipment for manufacturing or research and development activities, the number of qualified employment positions falls below the ten percent threshold in this subsection, the amount of deferred taxes outstanding for the project is immediately due.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>A person is entitled to relief under this section only once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person whose application for relief from the payment of deferred taxes has been approved under this section must continue to file an annual tax performance report as required under RCW 82.60.070(1) or any successor statute.
