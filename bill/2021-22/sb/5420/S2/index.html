<p>The legislature finds that state data reporting requirements for hospitals are placing unwarranted burdens on the health care system during the national and state emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The legislature further finds that such an assessment must identify which hospital data reporting obligations need to be modified and whether collecting additional data or information fulfills legislative objectives.</p>
