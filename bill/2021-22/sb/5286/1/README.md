# Senate Bill 5286

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5286.xml)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that management of organic waste is an essential component of the state's solid waste management system. Proper management of organic waste provides many environmental and economic benefits to the state, local governments, residents, and businesses. Composting, anaerobic digestion, and other forms of organic waste management can mitigate climate change by reducing our carbon footprint through increased carbon sequestration, when compost or recycled organic materials are applied to soil systems, and through the useful diversion of organic waste from landfills, where the waste would otherwise produce carbon intensive methane emissions. This diversion of organic waste creates a savings in space for landfills that are already overstressed by the current demand for waste disposal.
Furthermore, recycling of organic waste contributes to a circular economy by eliminating waste, keeping local products and material in use, and regenerating natural systems. Compost and other recycled organic waste products also enrich soil, improve soil structure, and reduce the need for chemical fertilizers, providing beneficial applications in agriculture, postconstruction soil conditioning, infrastructure projects, horticulture, stormwater filtration, and erosion control.
The legislature also finds that interpretation and implementation of permitting requirements for organic waste processors across the state can vary among local jurisdictions. This and other siting requirements can cause barriers to the establishment of new composting facilities and the expansion of existing compost facilities.
Therefore, the legislature intends to establish a statewide organic waste management goal to be accomplished over the next decade in order to promote the reduction of organic waste resources going to landfills, the diversification of how organic waste is managed, the identification of technologies and methods for carbon sequestration, and the comprehensive use of compost and other recycled organic waste products by state and local governments, residents, and businesses to facilitate the growth of organic waste processing statewide.

## Section 4
> This section modifies existing section [70A.205.050](/rcw/70A_environmental_health_and_safety/70A.205_solid_waste_management—reduction_and_recycling.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/70A_environmental_health_and_safety/70A.205_solid_waste_management—reduction_and_recycling.md) for context.

1. Levels of service shall be defined in the waste reduction and recycling element of each local comprehensive solid waste management plan and shall include the services set forth in RCW 70A.205.045. In determining which service level is provided to residential and nonresidential waste generators in each community, counties and cities shall develop clear criteria for designating areas as urban or rural. In designating urban areas, local governments shall consider the planning guidelines adopted by the department, total population, population density, and any applicable land use or utility service plans.

2. **Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated specifically to cover local government costs, each city and county with a population of 50,000 or more must ensure that its comprehensive solid waste management plan incorporates approaches for source reduction, on-site and off-site management of organics, and where practical, levels of service that will achieve within its jurisdiction the organic waste diversion and reduction goals established under section 3 of this act.**


## Section 5
> This section modifies existing section [70A.205.055](/rcw/70A_environmental_health_and_safety/70A.205_solid_waste_management—reduction_and_recycling.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/70A_environmental_health_and_safety/70A.205_solid_waste_management—reduction_and_recycling.md) for context.

1. The department and local governments preparing plans are encouraged to work cooperatively during plan development. Each county and city preparing a comprehensive solid waste management plan shall submit a preliminary draft plan to the department for technical review. The department shall review and comment on the draft plan within one hundred twenty days of receipt. The department's comments shall state specific actions or revisions that must be completed for plan approval.

2. Each final draft solid waste management plan shall be submitted to the department for approval. The department will limit its comments on the final draft plans to those issues identified during its review of the draft plan and any other changes made between submittal of the preliminary draft and final draft plans. Disapproval of the local comprehensive solid waste management plan shall be supported by specific findings. A final draft plan shall be deemed approved if the department does not disapprove it within forty-five days of receipt.

3. If the department disapproves a plan or any plan amendments, the submitting entity may appeal the decision to the pollution control hearings board as provided in RCW 43.21B.230. The appeal shall be limited to review of the specific findings which supported the disapproval under subsection (2) of this section.

4. **The department may approve a plan or plan amendment for a city or county that meets the population threshold in RCW 70A.205.050(2) and is subject to the organic waste management goals established in section 3 of this act but fails to achieve the goals and requirements of section 3 of this act and RCW 70A.205.050, where the department determines that areas within the city or county lack composting facilities within a reasonable distance. The department may condition the approval and convene the local jurisdictions and solid waste handling and recycling industry to evaluate how to meet the goal of providing organic waste recycling and composting capacity within a reasonable distance, based on local constraints.**
