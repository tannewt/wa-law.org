<h2 id="section-1-42">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-42">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The greenhouse gas emissions limits established by the legislature in 2020 require significant and rapid reductions in all uses of fossil fuels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 2021 state energy strategy recommended that the state develop and implement a planned transition from fossil natural gas end uses to alternative energy forms that do not result in greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of residential and commercial customers using fossil natural gas has increased each year in the most recent 10 years for which data is available. Growth in the number of residential and commercial customers using fossil natural gas has increased emissions from fossil natural gas in Washington by an estimated 870,000 metric tons CO2e per year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the climate commitment act, gas companies will receive a limited amount of allowances at no cost that decline proportionally with the cap established under RCW 70A.65.070. Continued growth in the number of customers using fossil natural gas will require purchase of increasingly constrained allowances in excess of the free amounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Careful and comprehensive transition planning by gas companies, with oversight and review by the utilities and transportation commission, is necessary to avoid the substantial risk of stranded investments in natural gas distribution systems and harm to customers. If the cost of these stranded investments is imposed on remaining customers after other customers convert to electric equipment, the financial burden could result in rates that are neither fair to customers nor adequate for investors. The unfair burden would fall disproportionately on low-income customers, residential and commercial tenants, and others unable to avoid continued use of fossil natural gas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In furtherance of section 143(4), chapter 334, Laws of 2021, the utilities and transportation commission has initiated in its docket U-210553 an inquiry to examine feasible and practical pathways for investor-owned electric and natural gas utilities to contribute their share to greenhouse gas emissions reductions as described in RCW 70A.45.020. As part of its examination, the utilities and transportation commission must identify and consider the impacts of energy decarbonization on residential and commercial customers and the electric and natural gas utilities that serve them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2-32">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-32">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This section adds a new section to an existing chapter <a href="/rcw/80_public_utilities/80.28_gas_electrical_and_water_companies.html">80.28</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/80_public_utilities/80.28_gas_electrical_and_water_companies.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Each gas company must develop and implement a clean heat transition plan for the purposes of: Meeting the state's greenhouse gas emissions limits with respect to fossil natural gas combustion; limiting the expansion of the natural gas system for residential and commercial space and water heating; advancing the use of high-efficiency electric equipment and production and distribution of clean fuels; and ensuring the safe and equitable transition of the natural gas system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each gas company must ensure in its clean heat transition plan an equitable transition of the gas system by:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Providing adequate energy assistance to low-income customers of the gas company under RCW 80.28.068;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring that the transition results in benefits to low-income households, overburdened communities, and vulnerable populations, as those terms are defined in chapters 19.405 and 70A.65 RCW;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring the equitable distribution of energy and nonenergy benefits of utility programs and infrastructure to overburdened communities and vulnerable populations, including the reduction of energy burdens and improvement of indoor and outdoor air quality.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>By January 1, 2024, and every four years thereafter, each gas company must develop and submit to the commission a clean heat transition plan to achieve the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, consistent with its proportional obligation under RCW 70A.45.020, as must be established by order of the commission, resulting from combustion of natural gas sold or delivered by the company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each gas company must base its clean heat transition plan on a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of multiple emissions reduction strategies to identify the combination of strategies that comply with the requirements of this section at lowest reasonable cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each clean heat transition plan must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Identify specific actions to achieve the gas company's share of the statewide obligation in RCW 70A.45.020, as determined by order of the commission, and must include an evaluation of the costs and benefits of alternative transition actions, including the costs and benefits that will accrue to vulnerable populations and overburdened communities. The cost-benefit analysis must incorporate the social cost of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the use of natural gas as determined by the commission pursuant to RCW 80.28.395;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider recommendations from the latest state energy strategy created under RCW 43.21F.090;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify changes to depreciation schedules or rate design to be consistent with specific actions in the clean heat transition plan;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Include an assessment of current conditions, including:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The economic, public health, and environmental conditions within the gas company's service territory. These conditions are not restricted to the effects of utility actions, and the analysis must include relevant information from publicly available sources, including the cumulative impact analysis developed by the department of health under RCW 19.405.140; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The energy and nonenergy benefits and burdens associated with the utility's infrastructure and programs, including benefits and burdens caused by utility actions outside the utility's service area;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assess the relative impact of alternative emissions reduction strategies on the amount of indoor air pollution and the health of customers; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support an equitable transition for overburdened communities and low-income customers through no-cost grant programs for low-income residents and low-cost or specially targeted incentive programs for moderate income or fixed income seniors.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each gas company must, at a minimum, consider the following emissions reduction strategies in developing each clean heat transition plan:</p>
