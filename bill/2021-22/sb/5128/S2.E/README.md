# Engrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill 5128 as Recommended by Ways & Means

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5128-S2.E.xml)
## Section 1
The legislature recognizes that the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed the delivery of education across the state, as school districts transition to remote learning environments to protect the health of students and staff. The legislature also recognizes that the role of transportation services has evolved alongside remote learning programs to help students equitably access the instructional program of basic education. As permitted by emergency proclamation, many school districts have adapted to remote learning by transporting meals, learning materials, and technology supports directly to students' homes or neighborhoods. Other school districts have used transportation resources to bring students to learning centers or other agencies where support services are provided.
This flexibility has allowed school districts to creatively use the resources at their disposal to equitably address the needs of students during an ongoing emergency.
With this act, the legislature intends to temporarily suspend rider eligibility criteria for an expanded list of qualifying transportation services, so that all students can access necessary supports during the COVID-19 emergency. The legislature also intends to provide a mechanism for calculating student transportation funding immediately following the COVID-19 emergency, so that the temporary drop in student ridership does not impact future transportation allocations. Finally, the legislature intends to appropriate additional relief funds to backfill reductions in state funding allocations resulting from transportation declines caused by the COVID-19 emergency.

## Section 3
> This section modifies an existing section. Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.160_student_transportation.md) for context.

Each district shall submit three times each year to the superintendent of public instruction during October, February, and May of each year a report containing the following:

1. [Empty]
    a. The number of eligible students transported to and from school as provided for in RCW 28A.160.150, along with identification of stop locations and school locations, and (b) the number of miles driven for pupil transportation services as authorized in RCW 28A.160.150 the previous school year; and

2. Other operational data and descriptions as required by the superintendent to determine allocation requirements for each district. The superintendent shall require that districts separate the costs of operating the program for the transportation of eligible students to and from school as defined by RCW 28A.160.160(3) **,** non-to-and-from-school pupil transportation costs**, and costs to provide expanded services under section 2(1) of this act** in the annual financial statement. The cost, quantity, and type of all fuel purchased by school districts for use in to-and-from-school transportation shall be included in the annual financial statement.

Each district shall submit the information required in this section on a timely basis as a condition of the continuing receipt of school transportation moneys.


## Section 4
> This section modifies an existing section. Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.160_student_transportation.md) for context.

1. The superintendent of public instruction shall phase-in the implementation of the distribution formula under this chapter for allocating state funds to school districts for the transportation of students to and from school. The phase-in shall begin no later than the 2011-2013 biennium and be fully implemented by the 2013-2015 biennium.

    a. The formula must be developed and revised on an ongoing basis using the major cost factors in student transportation, including basic and special student loads, school district land area, average distance to school, roadway miles, and number of locations served. Factors must include all those site characteristics that are statistically significant after analysis of the data required by the revised reporting process.

    b. The formula must allocate funds to school districts based on the average predicted costs of transporting students to and from school, using a regression analysis. Only factors that are statistically significant shall be used in the regression analysis. Employee compensation costs included in the allowable transportation expenditures used for the purpose of establishing each school district's independent variable in the regression analysis shall be limited to the base salary or hourly wage rates, fringe benefit rates, and applicable health care rates provided in the omnibus appropriations act.

2. During the phase-in period, funding provided to school districts for student transportation operations shall be distributed on the following basis:

    a. Annually, each school district shall receive the lesser of the previous school year's pupil transportation operations allocation, or the total of allowable pupil transportation expenditures identified on the previous school year's final expenditure report to the state plus district indirect expenses using the federal restricted indirect rate as calculated in the district annual financial report;

    b. Annually, the amount identified in (a) of this subsection shall be adjusted for any budgeted increases provided in the omnibus appropriations act for salaries or fringe benefits;

    c. Annually, any funds appropriated by the legislature in excess of the maintenance level funding amount for student transportation shall be distributed among school districts on a prorated basis using the difference between the amount identified in (a) adjusted by (b) of this subsection and the amount determined under the formula in RCW 28A.160.180; and

    d. Allocations provided to recognize the cost of depreciation to districts contracting with private carriers for student transportation shall be deducted from the allowable transportation expenditures in (a) of this subsection.

**(3) If a school or school district provided full remote or partial remote instruction under the authority of RCW 28A.150.290 due to a local, state, or national emergency that caused a substantial disruption to full in-person instruction, the superintendent of public instruction may use the student transportation data from the last reporting period in which the school district provided full in-person instruction to calculate transportation allocations. Such data may only be used until the subsequent reporting period when updated ridership data is available.**


## Section 7
(1) The public schools emergency transportation relief account is created in the state treasury. Money in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Expenditures from the account may only be used to backfill reductions in state funding allocations resulting from transportation declines caused by a declared statewide emergency, provided that such reductions have not been backfilled through receipt of federal emergency relief funds, and must be attributable to documented allowable uses for transportation-related services as established under section 2 of this act.
(2) A charter school, state-tribal compact school, or school district may not receive expenditures from the public schools emergency transportation relief account if the school or school district meets the minimum parameters for in-person learning recommended by the department of health and does not offer in-person learning at or above the recommended level.
(3) Any funds that remain in the public schools emergency transportation relief account at the end of the 2021-2023 fiscal biennia must be deposited into the state general fund.
(4) The public schools emergency transportation relief account is intended to be the payor of last resort, and as such no charter school, state-tribal compact school, or school district may receive expenditures from the account until the school or school district has demonstrated there are no available federal relief funds that can be used to address allowable transportation costs.

## Section 8
The sum of $100,000,000 is appropriated for fiscal year 2021, from the general fund account—state to the public schools emergency transportation relief account created in section 7 of this act for the purposes of backfilling reductions in state funding allocations resulting from transportation declines caused by a declared statewide emergency, provided that such reductions have not been backfilled through receipt of federal emergency relief funds, and must be attributable to documented allowable uses for transportation-related services as established under section 2 of this act.
