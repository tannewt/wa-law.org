<p>This act may be known and cited as the Washington privacy act.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-590">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-590">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the people of Washington regard their privacy as a fundamental right and an essential element of their individual freedom. Washington's Constitution explicitly provides the right to privacy, and fundamental privacy rights have long been and continue to be integral to protecting Washingtonians and to safeguarding our democratic republic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ongoing advances in technology have produced an exponential growth in the volume and variety of personal data being generated, collected, stored, and analyzed, which presents both promise and potential peril. The ability to harness and use data in positive ways is driving innovation and brings beneficial technologies to society. However, it has also created risks to privacy and freedom. The unregulated and unauthorized use and disclosure of personal information and loss of privacy can have devastating impacts, ranging from financial fraud, identity theft, and unnecessary costs, to personal time and finances, to destruction of property, harassment, reputational damage, emotional distress, and physical harm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given that technological innovation and new uses of data can help solve societal problems, protect public health associated with global pandemics, and improve quality of life, the legislature seeks to shape responsible public policies where innovation and protection of individual privacy coexist. The legislature notes that our federal authorities have not developed or adopted into law regulatory or legislative solutions that give consumers control over their privacy. In contrast, the European Union's general data protection regulation has continued to influence data privacy policies and practices of those businesses competing in global markets. In the absence of federal standards, Washington and other states across the United States are analyzing elements of the European Union's general data protection regulation to enact state-based data privacy regulatory protections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Responding to COVID-19 illustrates the need for public policies that protect individual privacy while fostering technological innovation. For years, contact tracing best practices have been used by public health officials to securely process high value individual data and have effectively stopped the prolific spread of infectious diseases. However, the scale of COVID-19 is unprecedented. Contact tracing is evolving in a manner that necessitates the use of technology to rapidly collect and process data from multiple data sets, many of which are unanticipated, to protect public health as well as to facilitate the continued safe operation of the economy. The benefits of such technology, however, should not supersede the potential privacy risks to individuals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exposure notification applications have already been deployed throughout the country and the world. However, contact tracing technology is rapidly evolving. Applications may be integrated in a manner that facilitates the aggregation and sharing of individual data that in effect generate profiles of individuals. Artificial intelligence may be used for the extrapolation of data to analyze and interpret data for public health purposes. Moreover, the potential government use of exposure notification applications poses additional potential privacy risks to individuals due to the types of sensitive data it has access to and processes. Much of that processing may have legal effects, including access to services or establishments. The capabilities of next generation contact tracing technologies are unknown and policies must be in place to provide privacy protections for current uses as well as potential future uses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With this act, the legislature intends to: Provide a modern privacy regulatory framework with data privacy guardrails to protect individual privacy; establish mechanisms for consumers to exercise control over their data; instill public confidence on the processing of their personal and public health data during any global pandemic; and require companies to be responsible custodians of data as technological innovations emerge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This act gives consumers the ability to protect their own rights to privacy by explicitly providing consumers the right to access, correct, and delete personal data, as well as the rights to obtain data in a portable format and to opt out of the collection and use of personal data for certain purposes. These rights will add to, and not subtract from, the consumer protection rights that consumers already have under Washington state law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This act also imposes affirmative obligations upon companies to safeguard personal data, and provide clear, understandable, and transparent information to consumers about how their personal data is used. It strengthens compliance and accountability by requiring data protection assessments in the collection and use of personal data. Finally, it exclusively empowers the state attorney general to obtain and evaluate a company's data protection assessments, to conduct investigations, while preserving consumers' rights under the consumer protection act to impose penalties where violations occur, and to prevent against future violations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lastly, the legislature encourages the state office of privacy and data protection to monitor (1) the development of universal privacy controls that communicate a consumer's affirmative, freely given, and unambiguous choice to opt out of the processing of their personal data, and (2) the effectiveness of allowing a consumer to designate a third party to exercise a consumer right on their behalf as authorized in other privacy laws.</p>

<p>Controllers and processors are responsible for meeting their respective obligations established under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Processors are responsible under this chapter for adhering to the instructions of the controller and assisting the controller to meet its obligations under this chapter. This assistance includes the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Taking into account the nature of the processing, the processor shall assist the controller by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfillment of the controller's obligation to respond to consumer requests to exercise their rights pursuant to section 103 of this act; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, the processor shall: Assist the controller in meeting the controller's obligations in relation to the security of processing the personal data and in relation to the notification of a breach of the security of the system pursuant to RCW 19.255.010; and provide information to the controller necessary to enable the controller to conduct and document any data protection assessments required by section 109 of this act. The controller and processor are each responsible for only the measures allocated to them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding the instructions of the controller, a processor shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Ensure that each person processing the personal data is subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to the data; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engage a subcontractor only after providing the controller with an opportunity to object and pursuant to a written contract in accordance with subsection (5) of this section that requires the subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking into account the context of processing, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk and establish a clear allocation of the responsibilities between them to implement such measures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Processing by a processor must be governed by a contract between the controller and the processor that is binding on both parties and that sets out the processing instructions to which the processor is bound, including the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data subject to the processing, the duration of the processing, and the obligations and rights of both parties. In addition, the contract must include the requirements imposed by this subsection and subsections (3) and (4) of this section, as well as the following requirements:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>At the choice of the controller, the processor shall delete or return all personal data to the controller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data is required by law;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The processor shall make available to the controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations in this chapter; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The processor shall allow for, and contribute to, reasonable audits and inspections by the controller or the controller's designated auditor. Alternatively, the processor may, with the controller's consent, arrange for a qualified and independent auditor to conduct, at least annually and at the processor's expense, an audit of the processor's policies and technical and organizational measures in support of the obligations under this chapter using an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and audit procedure for the audits as applicable, and provide a report of the audit to the controller upon request.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In no event may any contract relieve a controller or a processor from the liabilities imposed on them by virtue of its role in the processing relationship as defined by this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that depends upon the context in which personal data are to be processed. A person that is not limited in its processing of personal data pursuant to a controller's instructions, or that fails to adhere to such instructions, is a controller and not a processor with respect to a specific processing of data. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor. If a processor begins, alone or jointly with others, determining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, it is a controller with respect to the processing.</p>

<li>
<p>A controller may not discriminate against a consumer for exercising any of the rights contained in this chapter, including denying goods or services to the consumer, charging different prices or rates for goods or services, and providing a different level of quality of goods and services to the consumer. This subsection does not prohibit a controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no fee, if the offering is in connection with a consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts, or club card program. If a consumer exercises their right pursuant to section 103(5) of this act, a controller may not sell personal data to a third-party controller as part of such a program unless: (a) The sale is reasonably necessary to enable the third party to provide a benefit to which the consumer is entitled; (b) the sale of personal data to third parties is clearly disclosed in the terms of the program; and (c) the third party uses the personal data only for purposes of facilitating such a benefit to which the consumer is entitled and does not retain or otherwise use or disclose the personal data for any other purpose.</p>

Data protection assessments are confidential and exempt from public inspection and copying under chapter 42.56 RCW. The disclosure of a data protection assessment pursuant to a request from the attorney general under this subsection does not constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege or work product protection with respect to the assessment and any information contained in the assessment unless otherwise subject to case law regarding the applicability of attorney-client privilege or work product protections.</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding the instructions of the controller, a processor shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Ensure that each person processing the personal data is subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to the data; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engage a subcontractor only after providing the controller with an opportunity to object and pursuant to a written contract in accordance with subsection (5) of this section that requires the subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data.</p>

In addition, the contract must include the requirements imposed by this subsection and subsections (3) and (4) of this section, as well as the following requirements:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>At the choice of the controller, the processor shall delete or return all personal data to the controller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data is required by law;</p>

Alternatively, the processor may, with the controller's consent, arrange for a qualified and independent auditor to conduct, at least annually and at the processor's expense, an audit of the processor's policies and technical and organizational measures in support of the obligations under this chapter using an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and audit procedure for the audits as applicable, and provide a report of the audit to the controller upon request.</p>

<p>Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that depends upon the context in which personal data is to be processed. A person that is not limited in its processing of personal data pursuant to a controller's instructions, or that fails to adhere to such instructions, is a controller and not a processor with respect to a specific processing of data. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor. If a processor begins, alone or jointly with others, determining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, it is a controller with respect to the processing.</p>

<p>Except as provided in this chapter, it is unlawful for a controller or processor to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Process technology-assisted contact tracing information unless:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The controller or processor provides the individual with a privacy notice prior to or at the time of the processing; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The individual provides consent for the processing;</p>

<li>
<p>Sell any technology-assisted contact tracing information; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Share any technology-assisted contact tracing information with another controller, processor, or third party unless the sharing is governed by a contract or data-sharing agreement as prescribed in section 303 of this act and is disclosed to an individual in the notice required in section 304 of this act.</p>

<li>
<p>Controllers and processors are responsible for meeting their respective obligations established under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Processors are responsible under this chapter for adhering to the instructions of the controller and assisting the controller to meet its obligations under this chapter. This assistance must include the processor assisting the controller in meeting the controller's obligations in relation to the security of processing technology-assisted contact tracing information and in relation to the notification of a breach of the security of the system pursuant to RCW 42.56.590.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding the instructions of the controller, a processor shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Ensure that each person processing the technology-assisted contact tracing information is subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to the information; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engage a subcontractor only after providing the controller with an opportunity to object and pursuant to a written contract in accordance with subsection (5) of this section that requires the subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the technology-assisted contact tracing information.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking into account the context of processing, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk and establish a clear allocation of the responsibilities between them to implement such measures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Processing by a processor must be governed by a contract or data-sharing agreement between the controller and the processor that is binding on both parties and that sets out the processing instructions to which the processor is bound, including the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of data subject to the processing, the duration of the processing, and the obligations and rights of both parties. In addition, the contract or data-sharing agreement must include the requirements imposed by this subsection and subsections (3) and (4) of this section, as well as the following requirements:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>At the choice of the controller, the processor shall delete or return all technology-assisted contact tracing information to the controller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the technology-assisted contact tracing information is required by law;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The processor shall make available to the controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations in this chapter; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The processor shall allow for, and contribute to, reasonable audits and inspections by the controller or the controller's designated auditor. Alternatively, the processor may, with the controller's consent, arrange for a qualified and independent auditor to conduct, at least annually and at the processor's expense, an audit of the processor's policies and technical and organizational measures in support of the obligations under this chapter using an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and audit procedure for the audits as applicable, and provide a report of the audit to the controller upon request.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In no event may any contract or data-sharing agreement relieve a controller or a processor from the liabilities imposed on them by virtue of its role in the processing relationship as defined in this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that depends upon the context in which technology-assisted contact tracing information is to be processed. A person that is not limited in its processing of technology-assisted contact tracing information pursuant to a controller's instructions, or that fails to adhere to such instructions, is a controller and not a processor with respect to processing of technology-assisted contact tracing information. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to processing of technology-assisted contact tracing information remains a processor. If a processor begins, alone or jointly with others, determining the purposes and means of the processing of technology-assisted contact tracing information, it is a controller with respect to the processing.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>A controller shall establish, implement, and maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical data security practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of technology-assisted contact tracing information.
