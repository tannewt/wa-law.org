<h2 id="section-1-227">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-227">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes that many federally recognized Indian tribes in Washington exercise felony criminal jurisdiction, yet none operate or have access to a prison facility. Tribal defendants sentenced to greater than one year in custody must serve their time in local jail facilities ill-equipped to house inmates for long sentences. This act will authorize the Washington state department of corrections to negotiate agreements with Indian tribes that will provide a public safety benefit to all residents of Washington by allowing tribal court inmates to serve their felony sentences in an appropriate facility with access to rehabilitative services.</p>
