<p>In the event the tax on special fuel imported into this state in the fuel supply tanks of motor vehicles for taxable use on Washington highways can be more accurately determined on a mileage basis, the department is authorized to approve and adopt such basis. When a special fuel user imports special fuel into or exports special fuel from the state of Washington in the fuel supply tanks of motor vehicles, the amount of special fuel consumed in such vehicles on Washington highways shall be deemed to be such proportion of the total amount of such special fuel consumed in his or her entire operations within and without this state as the total number of miles traveled on the public highways within this state bears to the total number of miles traveled within and without the state. The department may also adopt such mileage basis for determining the taxable use of special fuel used in motor vehicles which travel regularly over prescribed courses on and off the highways within the state of Washington. In the absence of records showing the number of miles actually operated per gallon of special fuel consumed, fuel consumption shall be calculated at the rate of one gallon for every: (1) Four miles traveled by vehicles over forty thousand pounds gross vehicle weight; (2) seven miles traveled by vehicles twelve thousand one to forty thousand pounds gross vehicle weight; (3) ten miles traveled by vehicles six thousand one to twelve thousand pounds gross vehicle weight; and (4) sixteen miles traveled by vehicles six thousand pounds or less gross vehicle weight.</p>

<p>If any licensee, whether or not licensed as such, fails, neglects, or refuses to file a required fuel tax report, the department must determine the tax liability and add the penalty provided in subsection (2) of this section to the liability. An assessment made by the department pursuant to this subsection or to subsection (2) of this section is presumed to be correct, and the burden is on the person who challenges the assessment to establish by a fair preponderance of the evidence that it is erroneous or excessive.</p>

<p>Except in the case of filing a false or fraudulent report, if the department deems mitigation of penalties and interest to be reasonable and in the best interests of carrying out the purpose of this chapter, it may mitigate the assessments.</p>

<li>
<p>Except in the case of a fraudulent report or failure to file a report, deficiencies, penalties, and interest must be assessed within five years from the twenty-fifth day of the next succeeding month following the reporting period for which the amount is determined or within five years after the return is filed, whichever period expires later.</p>

<p>The state patrol must list and particularly describe in duplicate the fuel seized. The selling price of the fuel seized must be the average terminal rack price for similar fuel, at the closest terminal rack on the day of sale, unless circumstance warrants that a different selling price is appropriate. The method used to value the fuel must be documented. The fuel must be sold at the earliest point in time, and the total price must include all appropriate state and federal taxes. The state patrol or the department may enter into contracts for the transportation, handling, storage, and sale of fuel subject to forfeiture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state patrol must, within five days after the seizure of a conveyance or fuel, cause notice to be served on the owner of the property seized, if known, on the person in charge of the property, and on any other person having any known right or interest in the property, of the seizure and intended forfeiture. The notice may be served by any method authorized by law or court rule including but not limited to service by mail. If service is by mail it must be by both certified mail with return receipt requested and regular mail. Service by mail is deemed complete upon mailing within the five-day period after the date of seizure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If no person notifies the state patrol in writing of the person's claim of ownership or right to possession of the items seized within fifteen days of the date of the notice of seizure, the items seized are considered forfeited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any person notifies the state patrol, in writing, of the person's claim of ownership or right to possession of the items seized within fifteen days of the date of the notice of seizure, the person or persons must be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard as to the claim or right. The hearing must be before the director of licensing, or the director's designee. A hearing and any appeals must be in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW. The burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence is upon the person claiming to be the lawful owner or the person claiming to have the lawful right to possession of the items seized. The state patrol and the department must promptly return the conveyance seized, and money from the sale of fuel seized, to the claimant upon a determination that the claimant is the present lawful owner and is lawfully entitled to possession of the items seized.</p>
