<p>The director shall by rule and regulation adopted as provided in chapter 34.05 RCW (Administrative Procedure Act) set up the necessary administrative procedure for collection by the department of the aircraft fuel excise tax as provided for in RCW 82.42.020, placing the responsibility of collection of said tax upon every distributor of aircraft fuel within the state; he or she may require the licensing of every distributor of aircraft fuel and shall require such a corporate surety bond or security of any distributor or person not otherwise bonded under provisions of *chapter 82.36 RCW as is provided for distributors of motor vehicle fuel under *RCW 82.36.060; he or she shall provide such forms and may require such reports or statements as in his or her determination shall be necessary for the proper administration of this chapter. The director may require such records to be kept, and for such periods of time, as deemed necessary for the administration of this chapter, which records shall be available at all times for the director or his or her representative who may require a statement under oath as to the contents thereof. During a state of emergency declared under RCW 43.06.010(12), the director, on his or her own motion or at the request of any taxpayer affected by the emergency, may extend the time for filing any report or the due date for tax remittances as the director deems proper.</p>
<p>Every application for a distributor's license must contain the following information to the extent it applies to the applicant:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Proof as the department may require concerning the applicant's identity, including but not limited to his or her fingerprints or those of the officers of a corporation making the application;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The qualification and business history of the applicant and any partner, officer, or director;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The applicant's financial condition or history including a bank reference and whether the applicant or any partner, officer, or director has ever been adjudged bankrupt or has an unsatisfied judgment in a federal or state court;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the applicant has been adjudged guilty of a crime that directly relates to the business for which the license is sought and the time elapsed since the conviction is less than ten years, or has suffered a judgment within the preceding five years in a civil action involving fraud, misrepresentation, or conversion and in the case of a corporation or partnership, all directors, officers, or partners.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After receipt of an application for a license, the director may conduct an investigation to determine whether the facts set forth are true. The director may require a fingerprint record check of the applicant through the Washington state patrol criminal identification system and the federal bureau of investigation before issuance of a license. The results of the background investigation including criminal history information may be released to authorized department personnel as the director deems necessary. The department shall charge a license holder or license applicant a fee of fifty dollars for each background investigation conducted.</p>
<p>An applicant who makes a false statement of a material fact on the application may be prosecuted for false swearing as defined by RCW 9A.72.040.</p>
