# Senate Bill 5316

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5316.xml)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that by constitutional design Washington's legislature has since statehood been a citizen legislature comprising individuals who conduct the people's business and then return to Washington's diverse communities to resume their lives as private individuals. The constitutional design of a part-time citizen legislature relies on the effective delegation of state fiscal authority to the executive branch and effective executive branch implementation of its authority to make expenditures on behalf of the state, along with appropriate oversight of this delegation and implementation. Therefore, the legislature finds it necessary to clarify delegated powers to the executive branch to effectively manage the state's finances while the legislature is not in session and to provide oversight during the legislative interim. Specifically, the legislature finds the power delegated to the governor to accept and expend unanticipated revenues requires a defined oversight board to prevent infringement on the legislature's sole constitutional power to appropriate state funds. Therefore, the legislature intends to revise the powers and processes to manage the state's finances and creates a joint legislative committee to provide legislative input and oversight of executive branch spending activities while the legislature is not in session.

The governor may reject or revise the request.** A copy of any **request the governor desires to approve must** be submitted to the joint legislative **interim budget** committee . **The committee must be provided ten calendar days to review and comment on the governor's request prior to approval under RCW 43.79.280.**

        ii. **Impose new or additional maintenance of effort requirements on existing programs or sources of funding;**

        iii. **Fund a new activity, program, or service in or into the next ensuing biennium;**

        iv. **Require implementation of the spending by contract or agreement that would prevent the legislature from appropriating the revenue; or**

    v. **Allow the state discretion to use the funds for multiple programs or purposes within a single department, agency, board, or commission or to use the funds in multiple departments, agencies, boards, or commissions.**

2. (a) **Whenever any money in the amount of five million dollars or more, from the federal government, or from other sources, which was not anticipated in the operating or capital budget approved by the legislature has been awarded or has actually been received when the legislature is not in session, the head of any department, agency, board, or commission through which such expenditures shall be made must submit a request to the governor in the form of a proposed allotment amendment setting forth the facts constituting the need for such expenditure and the estimated amount to be expended. The request must also include an explanation of the timing, source, and availability of such funds and why the need for expenditure could not have been anticipated in time for such expenditure to have been approved as part of the operating or capital budget act for that particular fiscal year.**

A copy of any proposal submitted to the governor to expend money from an appropriated transportation fund or account in excess of appropriations provided by law that is based on the receipt of unanticipated revenues must be submitted, at a minimum, to the standing committees on transportation of the house and senate at the same time as it is transmitted to the governor. **The committees must be provided ten calendar days to review and comment on the request prior to approval under RCW 43.79.280.**

4. **Expenditures authorized under this section may not be made in excess of the actual amount received, and no money may be expended for any purpose except the specific purpose for which it was received.**

5. **If unanticipated moneys from nonstate sources could be used to save or replace general fund moneys to accomplish a budgeted program or purpose, then the governor must also submit with the request an alternative proposal to use the unanticipated moneys for the sole purpose of reducing general fund allotments and to place such moneys in unallotted reserve status. The joint legislative interim budget committee may approve the request submitted by the governor, in whole or in part, or the alternative proposal.**

6. **The processes provided in this section must be followed to revise an approved request under RCW 43.79.280 to change the amount approved for expenditure or the purpose or use of the unanticipated moneys. For all other revisions to approved requests, the governor must notify the joint legislative interim budget committee of the proposed changes and provide ten calendar days to review and comment on the revision prior to its implementation.**

7. **For purposes of this section, moneys have been awarded if the state has received a document from the federal government or other sources setting forth the terms and conditions of a grant, cooperative agreement, or other agreement to receive financial assistance.**
