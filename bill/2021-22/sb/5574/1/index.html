<h2 id="section-32-14">Section 32 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-32-14">¶</a></h2>
<p>During the interim period for a new county, the parent county or counties remains responsible for providing all county services previously provided by that parent county in the portion of the parent county that is stricken to form a new county at the current level of service, unless otherwise agreed to between the parent county and the initial officers of the new county.</p>
