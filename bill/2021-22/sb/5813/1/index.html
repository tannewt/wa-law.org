<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the people of Washington regard their privacy as a fundamental right and an essential element of their individual freedom. Washington's Constitution explicitly provides the right to privacy and fundamental privacy rights have long been and continue to be integral to protecting Washingtonians and to safeguarding our democratic republic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington is a technology leader on a national and global level and recognizes its distinctive position in promoting the efficient balance of consumer privacy and economic benefits. Ongoing advances in technology have produced an exponential growth in the volume and variety of personal data being generated, collected, stored, and analyzed, which presents both promise and potential peril. The ability to harness and use data in positive ways is driving innovation and brings beneficial technologies to society. However, it has also created risks to privacy and freedom. The unregulated and unauthorized use and disclosure of personal information and loss of privacy can have devastating impacts, ranging from financial fraud, identity theft, and unnecessary costs, to personal time and finances, to destruction of property, harassment, reputational damage, emotional distress, and physical harm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From a very young age, today's youth spend an extensive amount of their time engaged in online activities and services for various purposes including education, socializing, shopping, gaming, and entertainment. Children and adolescents navigate various websites and online applications without fully understanding what personal data is being collected about them, how this data can impact them in the future, or how to ensure the privacy and security of their personal data. The personal data of this vulnerable population requires and deserves additional protections, which includes parental or guardian oversight, adolescent control of data, and the ability for adults to delete their personal data from when they were a child or adolescent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are many different types of businesses that collect data about and from consumers. However, a data broker is in the business of combining and selling data about consumers with whom it does not have a direct relationship. Data brokers often collect data from multiple sources, all while consumers may not know that the data broker exists. While data brokers offer many benefits in a modern economy, such as providing information that is critical to services including credit reporting, background checks, risk mitigation, fraud detection, and people search, there are also risks associated with the prevalent combination and sale of data about consumers. These risks may relate to a consumer's ability to know and control information held and sold about them and risks due to the unauthorized or harmful acquisition and use of consumer information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to provide consumers with more control over how their personal data is used by businesses, several states have enacted laws that provide consumers with the right to opt out of targeted advertising and the sale of their data. In an effort to make the opt out right more workable for consumers, such laws often authorize consumers to request to opt out through do not track mechanisms and require businesses to recognize these requests. However, technical specifications needed to implement such a requirement are in the early stages of development and it is worth taking a measured, thoughtful approach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With this act, the legislature intends to: Strengthen and expand existing privacy protections for Washington residents by establishing additional protections and controls for the personal data of children and adolescents; provide consumers transparency about data brokers; require data brokers to allow consumers to access, delete, and correct their data; and engage in deliberate, inclusive rule making to determine appropriate and reasonable technical specifications for honoring consumer requests to opt out of certain processing. In addition, this act imposes affirmative obligations upon companies to safeguard personal data and provide clear, understandable, and transparent information to consumers about how their personal data is used.</p>

<p>A business must conduct and document a data protection assessment of each of its processing activities involving the personal data of children or adolescents. Such a data protection assessment must take into account the type of personal data to be processed by the business, including the extent to which the personal data is sensitive data, and the context in which the personal data is to be processed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A data protection assessment conducted under subsection (1) of this section must identify and weigh the benefits that may flow directly and indirectly from the processing to the business, the adolescent or child, other stakeholders, and the public against the potential risks to the rights of the adolescent, child, or parent or legal guardian of the child associated with such processing, as mitigated by safeguards that can be employed by the business to reduce such risks. The use of deidentified data and the reasonable expectations of adolescents, children, and parents or legal guardians, as well as the context of the processing and the relationship between the business and the adolescent, child, or parent or legal guardian must be factored into this assessment by the business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The attorney general may request, in writing, that a business disclose any data protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the attorney general. The business must make a data protection assessment available to the attorney general upon such a request. The attorney general may evaluate the data protection assessments for compliance with the responsibilities contained in this chapter and, if it serves a civil investigative demand, with RCW 19.86.110. Data protection assessments are confidential and exempt from public inspection and copying under chapter 42.56 RCW. The disclosure of a data protection assessment pursuant to a request from the attorney general under this subsection does not constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege or work product protection with respect to the assessment and any information contained in the assessment unless otherwise subject to case law regarding the applicability of attorney-client privilege or work product protections.</p>
