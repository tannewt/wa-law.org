</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The eviction prevention rental assistance program is created in the department to prevent evictions by providing resources to households most likely to become homeless or suffer severe health consequences, or both, after an eviction, while promoting equity by prioritizing households, including communities of color, disproportionately impacted by public health emergencies and by homelessness and housing instability. The department must provide grants to eligible organizations, as described in RCW 43.185.060, to provide assistance to program participants. The eligible organizations must use grant moneys for:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Rental assistance, including rental arrears and future rent if needed to stabilize the applicant's housing and prevent their eviction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utility assistance for households if needed to prevent an eviction; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Administrative costs of the eligible organization, which must not exceed limits prescribed by the department.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Households eligible to receive assistance through the eviction prevention rental assistance program are those:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>With incomes at or below 80 percent of the county area median income;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who are families with children, living in doubled up situations, young adults, senior citizens, and others at risk of homelessness or significant physical or behavioral health complications from homelessness; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That meet any other eligibility requirements as established by the department after consultation with stakeholder groups, including persons at risk of homelessness due to unpaid rent, representatives of communities of color, homeless service providers, landlord representatives, local governments that administer homelessness assistance, a statewide association representing cities, a statewide association representing counties, and affordable housing advocates.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eligible grantees must actively work with organizations rooted in communities of color to assist and serve marginalized populations within their communities. At least 10 percent of the grant total must be subgranted to organizations that serve and are substantially governed by marginalized populations to pay the costs associated with program outreach, assistance completing applications for assistance, and related costs. Upon request by an eligible grantee or the county or city in which it exists, the department must provide a list of organizations that serve and are substantially governed by marginalized populations, if known. If an eligible grantee is unable to subgrant with an organization that serves and is substantially governed by marginalized populations, the grantee may request an exemption from the subgrant requirement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must ensure equity by developing performance measures and benchmarks that promote both equitable program access and equitable program outcomes. Performance measures and benchmarks must be developed by the department in consultation with stakeholder groups, including persons at risk of homelessness due to unpaid rent, representatives of communities of color, homeless service providers, landlord representatives, local governments that administer homelessness assistance, a statewide association representing cities, a statewide association representing counties, and affordable housing advocates. Performance measures and benchmarks must also ensure that the race and ethnicity of households served under the program are proportional to the numbers of people at risk of homelessness in each county for each of the following groups:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Black or African American;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>American Indian and Alaska Native;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hispanic or Latinx;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asian;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other multiracial.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may develop additional rules, requirements, procedures, and guidelines as necessary to implement and operate the eviction prevention rental assistance program.</p>
</li>
