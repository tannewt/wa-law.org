<blockquote>
<p>This section adds a new section to an existing chapter <a href="/rcw/38_militia_and_military_affairs/38.52_emergency_management.html">38.52</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/38_militia_and_military_affairs/38.52_emergency_management.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>

<li>
<p>To ensure the readiness of the health care system and its ability to work with emergency management in responding to an emergency or disaster, the statutes and regulations set forth in this section are automatically waived or suspended upon the governor's declaration of a statewide state of emergency pursuant to RCW 43.06.010, unless:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The governor issues an order rejecting the waiver or suspension of all statutes and regulations or specific statutes or regulations based on a finding that strict compliance with the statutes or regulations would not prevent, hinder, or delay necessary action in responding to the emergency or disaster; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The statute or regulation implements or is dependent on a federal law that has not been waived by the federal government and waiving the state statute or regulation would result in a failure to comply with such federal law. For the purposes of this exception, a federal law for which the federal government has issued a statement regarding enforcement discretion is treated as waived.</p>

<li>
<p>If the governor's proclamation of a state of emergency coincides with a state of emergency declaration by the president of the United States that includes the state of Washington and any agency of the federal government waives or suspends statutory and regulatory obligations or limitations that apply to the health care system operating in this state, for which there is a corresponding state statute or regulation that has not been automatically waived under this section, the state may not penalize a health care facility or a health care provider as defined in RCW 70.02.010 for acting in reliance on the federal waiver or suspension until the state explicitly declines to waive or suspend the corresponding state statute or regulation.</p>
