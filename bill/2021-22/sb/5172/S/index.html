<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that the numerous cases in Washington state have addressed the application of the prospective and retroactive effect of the courts' decisions, and that the courts have established a general rule favoring retroactivity. The legislature finds that recent decisions relating to overtime wage claims create exceptional cases requiring unique legislative action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to address the retroactive effect of court decisions concerning overtime wage claims by removing an exceptional constitutionally suspect historical exemption and by creating an affirmative defense for employers which are affected by the elimination of the exceptional historical exemption.</p>
