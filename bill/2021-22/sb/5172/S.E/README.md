# Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 5172 as Recommended by Labor, Commerce & Tribal Affairs

## Section 1
In order to stabilize, strengthen, and protect our state's agricultural workforce and economy, it is the intent of the legislature to pass the laws necessary to protect farmworkers and to provide agricultural employers with certainty and predictability. 
The legislature intends to address the historical exceptions of agricultural work from overtime standards from both the federal fair labor standards act and the state minimum wage act when they were enacted over 70 years ago. Excluded from the opportunity to earn overtime pay, farmworkers across our state remain among our state's poorest workers. A United States department of labor study in 2016 found that nationally, 30 percent of farmworker families live below the poverty line, almost double the poverty rate of American families overall. The state department of health found that the current novel coronavirus pandemic has had a significant and disproportionate impact on farmworkers. The virus' risks to essential farmworkers from potential workplace exposures are compounded by systemic barriers to testing, prevention measures, and medical care.
The legislature also intends to avoid disruptions within the state's vital agricultural sector. While Washington is well known as the national leader in apple production, the state's agricultural sector is incredibly diverse: Over 300 crops are harvested, and a variety of livestock are raised on over 35,000 farms across the state. The robust size of our agricultural sector means our state overall ranks in the top 10 nationally in the size of our farm labor force. Agriculture is a cornerstone of our state economy. Uncertainty from recent legal decisions regarding overtime standards are compounding the pandemic's disruptions to the food chain and the safety challenges of operating during a public health crisis.
The legislature intends to provide clear overtime standards to reduce litigation between parties in this key sector of the state's economy during the challenges and additional costs brought on by the novel coronavirus and to protect the security of our food supply chain. This act's transitional approach is reasonable to achieve the legislature's purpose of increasing the safety of an at risk and essential workforce, increasing the public welfare of low-income individuals by removing a historical barrier to their earning potential, and maintaining the food security and economic security provided by a stable agricultural sector.

## Section 2
> This section modifies existing section [49.46.130](/rcw/49_labor_regulations/49.46_minimum_wage_requirements_and_labor_standards.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/49_labor_regulations/49.46_minimum_wage_requirements_and_labor_standards.md) for context.

1. Except as otherwise provided in this section **and section 4 of this act**, no employer shall employ any of his or her employees for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such employee receives compensation for his or her employment in excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he or she is employed.

2. This section does not apply to:

    a. Any person exempted pursuant to RCW 49.46.010(3). The payment of compensation or provision of compensatory time off in addition to a salary shall not be a factor in determining whether a person is exempted under RCW 49.46.010(3)(c);

    b. Employees who request compensating time off in lieu of overtime pay;

    c. Any individual employed as a seaman whether or not the seaman is employed on a vessel other than an American vessel;

    d. Seasonal employees who are employed at concessions and recreational establishments at agricultural fairs, including those seasonal employees employed by agricultural fairs, within the state provided that the period of employment for any seasonal employee at any or all agricultural fairs does not exceed fourteen working days a year;

    e. Any individual employed as a motion picture projectionist if that employee is covered by a contract or collective bargaining agreement which regulates hours of work and overtime pay;

    f. An individual employed as a truck or bus driver who is subject to the provisions of the Federal Motor Carrier Act (49 U.S.C. Sec. 3101 et seq. and 49 U.S.C. Sec. 10101 et seq.), if the compensation system under which the truck or bus driver is paid includes overtime pay, reasonably equivalent to that required by this subsection, for working longer than forty hours per week;

    g. **Except as otherwise provided in section 4 of this act, any** individual employed (i) on a farm, in the employ of any person, in connection with the cultivation of the soil, or in connection with raising or harvesting any agricultural or horticultural commodity, including raising, shearing, feeding, caring for, training, and management of livestock, bees, poultry, and furbearing animals and wildlife, or in the employ of the owner or tenant or other operator of a farm in connection with the operation, management, conservation, improvement, or maintenance of such farm and its tools and equipment; or (ii) in packing, packaging, grading, storing or delivering to storage, or to market or to a carrier for transportation to market, any agricultural or horticultural commodity; or (iii) commercial canning, commercial freezing, or any other commercial processing, or with respect to services performed in connection with the cultivation, raising, harvesting, and processing of oysters or in connection with any agricultural or horticultural commodity after its delivery to a terminal market for distribution for consumption;

    h. Any industry in which federal law provides for an overtime payment based on a workweek other than forty hours. However, the provisions of the federal law regarding overtime payment based on a workweek other than forty hours shall nevertheless apply to employees covered by this section without regard to the existence of actual federal jurisdiction over the industrial activity of the particular employer within this state. For the purposes of this subsection, "industry" means a trade, business, industry, or other activity, or branch, or group thereof, in which individuals are gainfully employed (section 3(h) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended (Public Law 93-259));

    i. Any hours worked by an employee of a carrier by air subject to the provisions of subchapter II of the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C.

    j. Any individual licensed under chapter 18.85 RCW unless the individual is providing real estate brokerage services under a written contract with a real estate firm which provides that the individual is an employee. For purposes of this subsection (2)(j), "real estate brokerage services" and "real estate firm" mean the same as defined in RCW 18.85.011.

3. No employer shall be deemed to have violated subsection (1) of this section by employing any employee of a retail or service establishment for a workweek in excess of the applicable workweek specified in subsection (1) of this section if:

    a. The regular rate of pay of the employee is in excess of one and one-half times the minimum hourly rate required under RCW 49.46.020; and

    b. More than half of the employee's compensation for a representative period, of not less than one month, represents commissions on goods or services.

In determining the proportion of compensation representing commissions, all earnings resulting from the application of a bona fide commission rate is to be deemed commissions on goods or services without regard to whether the computed commissions exceed the draw or guarantee.

4. No employer of commissioned salespeople primarily engaged in the business of selling automobiles, trucks, recreational vessels, recreational vessel trailers, recreational vehicle trailers, recreational campers, manufactured housing, or farm implements to ultimate purchasers shall violate subsection (1) of this section with respect to such commissioned salespeople if the commissioned salespeople are paid the greater of:

    a. Compensation at the hourly rate, which may not be less than the rate required under RCW 49.46.020, for each hour worked up to forty hours per week, and compensation of one and one-half times that hourly rate for all hours worked over forty hours in one week; or

    b. A straight commission, a salary plus commission, or a salary plus bonus applied to gross salary.

5. No public agency shall be deemed to have violated subsection (1) of this section with respect to the employment of any employee in fire protection activities or any employee in law enforcement activities (including security personnel in correctional institutions) if: (a) In a work period of twenty-eight consecutive days the employee receives for tours of duty which in the aggregate exceed two hundred forty hours; or (b) in the case of such an employee to whom a work period of at least seven but less than twenty-eight days applies, in his or her work period the employee receives for tours of duty which in the aggregate exceed a number of hours which bears the same ratio to the number of consecutive days in his or her work period as two hundred forty hours bears to twenty-eight days; compensation at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he or she is employed.
