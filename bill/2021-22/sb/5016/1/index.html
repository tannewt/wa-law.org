The declaration must include a statement signed by the owner that a wheeled all-terrain vehicle that had been previously converted to a tracked all-terrain vehicle must conform with all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards and state standards while in use as a wheeled all-terrain vehicle upon public roads, streets, or highways.
