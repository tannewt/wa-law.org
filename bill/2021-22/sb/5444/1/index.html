<h2 id="section-1-249">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-249">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that increasing the rate of adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles is helping to reduce harmful air pollution from exhaust emissions, including greenhouse gas emissions, in the state. At the same time, the legislature also finds that there is a need to ensure that the greater adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles does not reduce funds to maintain and improve transportation infrastructure and that there is a need for fairness in how these funds are generated. The legislature also finds that a road usage charge or per mile fee system appears to be a viable method to ensure these goals are achieved. It is therefore the legislature's intent to impose a per mile fee to mitigate the impact of increased electric and hybrid vehicles on state roads and highways and to allow further evaluation of the feasibility of transitioning from a revenue collection system based on fuel taxes to a per mile funding system.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds and declares that the per mile funding system must at all times recognize and respect an individual's interests in privacy, information use, and civil liberties. Experience in states that collect road usage charges, as well as the research and year-long test of road usage charging in Washington, demonstrates that mileage-based charges can be implemented in a way that ensures data security and protects the privacy of vehicle owners. The legislature intends that the per mile funding system authorized in this act be designed and implemented in a manner that places privacy of the vehicle owner as a first principle, especially with regard to location data. Detailed travel locations or patterns must not be disclosed, and legal and technical safeguards must protect personal information.</p>

<p>By December 1, 2022, the department and the transportation commission must collaborate to develop an implementation plan for the voluntary early adoption program pursuant to subsection (3) of this section and imposing a per mile fee on electric and hybrid vehicles pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. This plan must incorporate the ongoing work of the transportation commission in evaluating a road usage charge, including coordinating with federal grant-funded research and development to continue in parallel with these activities. The plan must include, but is not limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Different mileage reporting methods;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluation and comparison of the benefits and costs of allowing for payment plan options and annual payment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any recommended statutory changes, including suggested offsets or rebates to the per mile fees. These offsets or rebates will not be utilized in the per mile funding system until approved by the legislature;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specific recommendations to better align the system with other vehicle-related charges and potentially establish the framework for broader implementation of a per mile funding system, including analysis of the preferred method for addressing eighteenth amendment restriction considerations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A recommended implementation and governance structure, and transition plan with the department as the designated lead agency to operate and administer the per mile funding system;</p>

<p>Recommendations for augmenting vehicle owner privacy in light of new and emerging mileage reporting methods or technologies, and proposed rules to be adopted by the commission related to extend privacy protections in a per mile funding system; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Detailed information on the recommended periodic review and evaluation process to best ensure the per mile funding system is achieving the policy and revenue goals established by the legislature.</p>

<p>To realize the environmental benefits of electrification of the transportation system it is necessary to support the adoption of electric vehicles and other electric technology in the state by incentivizing the purchase of these vehicles, building out the charging infrastructure, developing greener transit options, and supporting clean alternative fuel infrastructure.
