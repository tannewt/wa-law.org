<li>
<p>Whenever a defendant has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, or there is reason to doubt his or her competency, the court on its own motion or on the motion of any party shall either appoint or request the secretary to designate a qualified expert or professional person, who shall be approved by the prosecuting attorney, to evaluate and report upon the mental condition of the defendant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The signed order of the court shall serve as authority for the evaluator to be given access to all records held by any mental health, medical, educational, or correctional facility that relate to the present or past mental, emotional, or physical condition of the defendant. If the court is advised by any party that the defendant may have a developmental disability, the evaluation must be performed by a developmental disabilities professional <strong>and the evaluator shall have access to records of the developmental disabilities administration of the department</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The evaluator shall assess the defendant in a jail, detention facility, in the community, or in court to determine whether a period of inpatient commitment will be necessary to complete an accurate evaluation. If inpatient commitment is needed, the signed order of the court shall serve as authority for the evaluator to request the jail or detention facility to transport the defendant to a hospital or secure mental health facility for a period of commitment not to exceed fifteen days from the time of admission to the facility. Otherwise, the evaluator shall complete the evaluation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court may commit the defendant for evaluation to a hospital or secure mental health facility without an assessment if: (i) The defendant is charged with murder in the first or second degree; (ii) the court finds that it is more likely than not that an evaluation in the jail will be inadequate to complete an accurate evaluation; or (iii) the court finds that an evaluation outside the jail setting is necessary for the health, safety, or welfare of the defendant. The court shall not order an initial inpatient evaluation for any purpose other than a competency evaluation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The order shall indicate whether, in the event the defendant is committed to a hospital or secure mental health facility for evaluation, all parties agree to waive the presence of the defendant or to the defendant's remote participation at a subsequent competency hearing or presentation of an agreed order if the recommendation of the evaluator is for continuation of the stay of criminal proceedings, or if the opinion of the evaluator is that the defendant remains incompetent and there is no remaining restoration period, and the hearing is held prior to the expiration of the authorized commitment period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a defendant is ordered to be evaluated under this subsection (1), or when a party or the court determines at first appearance that an order for evaluation under this subsection will be requested or ordered if charges are pursued, the court may delay granting bail until the defendant has been evaluated for competency or sanity and appears before the court. Following the evaluation, in determining bail the court shall consider: (i) Recommendations of the evaluator regarding the defendant's competency, sanity, or diminished capacity; (ii) whether the defendant has a recent history of one or more violent acts; (iii) whether the defendant has previously been acquitted by reason of insanity or found incompetent; (iv) whether it is reasonably likely the defendant will fail to appear for a future court hearing; and (v) whether the defendant is a threat to public safety.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court may direct that a qualified expert or professional person retained by or appointed for the defendant be permitted to witness the evaluation authorized by subsection (1) of this section, and that the defendant shall have access to all information obtained by the court appointed experts or professional persons. The defendant's expert or professional person shall have the right to file his or her own report following the guidelines of subsection (3) of this section. If the defendant is indigent, the court shall upon the request of the defendant assist him or her in obtaining an expert or professional person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The report of the evaluation shall include the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A description of the nature of the evaluation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A diagnosis or description of the current mental status of the defendant;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the defendant suffers from a mental disease or defect, or has a developmental disability, an opinion as to competency;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the defendant has indicated his or her intention to rely on the defense of insanity pursuant to RCW 10.77.030, and an evaluation and report by an expert or professional person has been provided concluding that the defendant was criminally insane at the time of the alleged offense, an opinion as to the defendant's sanity at the time of the act, and an opinion as to whether the defendant presents a substantial danger to other persons, or presents a substantial likelihood of committing criminal acts jeopardizing public safety or security, unless kept under further control by the court or other persons or institutions, provided that no opinion shall be rendered under this subsection (3)(d) unless the evaluator or court determines that the defendant is competent to stand trial;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When directed by the court, if an evaluation and report by an expert or professional person has been provided concluding that the defendant lacked the capacity at the time of the offense to form the mental state necessary to commit the charged offense, an opinion as to the capacity of the defendant to have a particular state of mind which is an element of the offense charged;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An opinion as to whether the defendant should be evaluated by a designated crisis responder under chapter 71.05 RCW.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The secretary may execute such agreements as appropriate and necessary to implement this section and may choose to designate more than one evaluator.</p>

<p>The legislature establishes <strong>a</strong> performance <strong>target of seven days or fewer for the following services related to competency to stand trial, when access to the services is legally authorized:</strong></p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p><strong>To extend an offer of admission to a defendant in pretrial custody for inpatient competency evaluation or inpatient competency restoration services;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>To extend an offer of admission to a defendant ordered to be committed to a state hospital following dismissal of charges based on incompetency to stand trial under RCW 10.77.086; and</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>To complete a competency evaluation in jail and distribute the evaluation report.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The legislature establishes a performance target of 21 days or fewer to complete a competency evaluation in the community and distribute the evaluation report.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A maximum time limit of 14 days is established to complete the services specified in subsection (1)(a) of this section, subject to the limitations under subsection (9) of this section</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that these targets may not be achievable in all cases , but intends for the department to manage, allocate, and request appropriations for resources in order to meet these targets whenever possible without sacrificing the accuracy and quality of competency</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>services</strong>.</p>
<p>The time periods measured in <strong>subsection (1) of this section</strong> shall run from the date on which the state hospital receives the court referral and charging documents, discovery, police reports, the names and addresses of the attorneys for the defendant and state or county, the name of the judge ordering the evaluation, information about the alleged crime, and criminal history information related to the defendant.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>It shall be a defense to an allegation that the department has exceeded the maximum time limits for completion of competency services described in  subsection (2) <strong>of this section</strong> if the department can demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the reason for exceeding the maximum time limits was outside of the department's control including, but not limited to, the following circumstances:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Despite a timely request, the department has not received necessary medical  information regarding the current medical status of a defendant ;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The individual circumstances of the defendant make accurate completion of an evaluation of competency to proceed or stand trial dependent upon review of mental health, substance use disorder, or medical history information which is in the custody of a third party and cannot be immediately obtained by the department**, provided that completion** shall not be postponed for procurement of  information which is merely supplementary ;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Additional time is needed for the defendant to no longer show active signs and symptoms of impairment related to substance use so that an accurate evaluation may be completed;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Completion of the referral <strong>requires additional time to accommodate the</strong> availability or participation <strong>of</strong> counsel,  court personnel, interpreters, or the defendant;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The defendant asserts legal rights that result in a delay in the provision of competency services; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An unusual spike in the receipt of evaluation referrals or in the number of defendants requiring restoration services has occurred, causing temporary delays until the unexpected excess demand for competency services can be resolved.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The department shall provide written notice to the court when it will not be able to meet the maximum time limits under subsection (2) of this section and identify the reasons for the delay and provide a reasonable estimate of the time necessary to complete the evaluation. Good cause for an extension for the additional time estimated by the department shall be presumed absent a written response from the court or a party received by the department within seven days.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Develop, document, and implement procedures to monitor the clinical status of defendants admitted to a state hospital for competency services that allow the state hospital to accomplish early discharge for defendants for whom clinical objectives have been achieved or may be achieved before expiration of the commitment period;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investigate the extent to which patients admitted to a state hospital under this chapter overstay time periods authorized by law and take reasonable steps to limit the time of commitment to authorized periods; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish written standards for the productivity of forensic evaluators and utilize these standards to internally review the performance of forensic evaluators.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following any quarter in which a state hospital has failed to meet one or more of the performance targets or maximum time limits <strong>under</strong> subsection (1) <strong>or (2)</strong> of this section , the department shall report to the executive and the legislature the extent of this deviation and describe any corrective action being taken to improve performance. This report <strong>shall</strong> be made publicly available. An average may be used to determine timeliness under this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The</strong> department shall report annually to the legislature and the executive on the timeliness of services related to competency to  stand trial and the timeliness with which court referrals accompanied by charging documents, discovery, and criminal history information are provided to the department relative to the signature date of the court order. The report must be in a form that is accessible to the public and that breaks down performance by county.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not create any new entitlement or cause of action related to the timeliness of competency <strong>to stand trial</strong> services , nor can it form the basis for contempt sanctions under chapter 7.21 RCW or a motion to dismiss criminal charges.</p>

<p>If the defendant is charged with a felony and determined to be incompetent, until he or she has regained the competency necessary to understand the proceedings against him or her and assist in his or her own defense, but in any event for a period of no longer than <strong>90</strong> days, the court shall commit the defendant to the custody of the secretary for <strong>inpatient</strong> competency restoration**, or may alternatively order the defendant to receive outpatient competency restoration based** on a recommendation from a forensic navigator and input from the parties.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>To be eligible for an order for outpatient competency restoration, a defendant must be clinically appropriate and be willing to:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Adhere to medications or receive prescribed intramuscular medication;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abstain from alcohol and unprescribed drugs**; and**</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court orders inpatient competency restoration, the department shall place the defendant in an appropriate facility of the department for competency restoration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court orders outpatient competency restoration, the court shall modify conditions of release as needed to authorize the department to place the person in approved housing, which may include access to supported housing, affiliated with a contracted outpatient competency restoration program. The department, in conjunction with the health care authority, must establish rules for conditions of participation in the outpatient competency restoration program, which must include the defendant being subject to medication management and regular urinalysis testing for defendants who have a current substance use disorder diagnosis. The outpatient competency restoration program shall monitor the defendant during the defendant's placement in the program and report any noncompliance or significant changes with respect to the defendant to the department and, if applicable, the forensic navigator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a defendant fails to comply with the restrictions of the outpatient restoration program such that restoration is no longer appropriate in that setting or the defendant is no longer clinically appropriate for outpatient competency restoration, the <strong>director of the outpatient competency restoration program shall notify the authority and the department of the need to terminate the outpatient competency restoration program and intent to request placement for the defendant</strong> in an appropriate facility of the department for inpatient competency restoration . <strong>The outpatient competency restoration program shall coordinate with the authority, the department, and any law enforcement personnel under (d)(i) of this subsection to ensure that the time period between termination and acceptance into the inpatient facility is as minimal as possible. The time period for inpatient competency restoration shall be the same as if the outpatient competency restoration had not occurred, starting from admission to the facility. The department shall obtain a placement for the defendant within seven days of the notice of termination of the outpatient competency restoration program.</strong></p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p><strong>The department may cause a peace officer to take the defendant into emergency custody for transport to a crisis stabilization unit, evaluation and treatment facility, emergency department of a local hospital, or triage facility for medical clearance, and thereafter to the designated inpatient competency restoration facility. The signed outpatient competency restoration order of the court shall serve as authority for the detention of the defendant under this subsection. This subsection does not preclude voluntary transportation of the defendant to a facility for medical clearance or inpatient competency restoration, or authorize admission of the defendant into jail.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall notify the court and parties of the <strong>defendant's admission for inpatient competency restoration</strong> before the close of the next judicial day. The court shall schedule a hearing within five days to review the  conditions of release of the defendant and <strong>anticipated release from treatment and</strong> issue appropriate orders. The standard of proof shall be a preponderance of the evidence, and the court may in its discretion render its decision based on written submissions, live testimony, or remote testimony.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court may not issue an order for outpatient competency restoration unless the department certifies that there is an available appropriate outpatient competency restoration program that has adequate space for the person at the time the order is issued or the court places the defendant under the guidance and control of a professional person identified in the court order.</p>

<li>
<p>For a defendant whose highest charge is a class C felony, or a class B felony that is not classified as violent under RCW 9.94A.030, the maximum time allowed for the initial <strong>felony competency restoration</strong> period  is <strong>45</strong> days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court determines or the parties agree <strong>before the initial felony competency restoration period or at any subsequent stage of the proceedings</strong> that the defendant is unlikely to regain competency, the court may dismiss the charges without prejudice without ordering the defendant to undergo <strong>an initial or further period of competency</strong> restoration treatment, in which case the court shall order that the defendant be referred for evaluation for civil commitment in the manner provided in subsection (5) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On or before expiration of the initial <strong>felony competency restoration</strong> period  the court shall conduct a hearing<strong>to</strong> determine whether  the defendant is <strong>now competent to stand trial.</strong> If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that <strong>the</strong> defendant  is incompetent <strong>to stand trial</strong>, the court <strong>may</strong> order <strong>an extension of the competency restoration period</strong> for an additional period of <strong>90</strong> days, but the court must at the <strong>same</strong> time  set a date for a <strong>new</strong> hearing to determine the defendant's competency <strong>to stand trial</strong> before the expiration of <strong>this</strong> second restoration period. The defendant, the defendant's attorney, <strong>and</strong> the prosecutor <strong>have</strong> the right to demand that the hearing be before a jury. No extension shall be ordered for a second or third <strong>felony competency</strong> restoration period  if the defendant's incompetence has been determined by the secretary to be solely the result of a developmental disability which is such that competence is not reasonably likely to be regained during an extension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>At</strong> the hearing upon the expiration of the second <strong>felony competency</strong> restoration period**,** or at the end of the first <strong>felony competency</strong> restoration period <strong>if the</strong> defendant <strong>is ineligible for a second or third competency restoration period under subsection (4) of this section</strong>, if the jury or court finds that the defendant is incompetent<strong>to stand trial, the court shall dismiss the charges</strong> without prejudice and  order the defendant <strong>to</strong> be committed to a state hospital  for up to <strong>120</strong> hours starting from admission to the facility, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, for evaluation for the purpose of filing a civil commitment petition under chapter 71.05 RCW. <strong>However, the court</strong> shall not <strong>dismiss the charges</strong> if the court or jury finds that: (a) The defendant (i) is a substantial danger to other persons; or (ii) presents a substantial likelihood of committing criminal acts jeopardizing public safety or security; and (b) there is a substantial probability that the defendant will regain competency within a reasonable period of time. <strong>If</strong> the court or jury makes such a finding, the court may extend the period of commitment for up to an additional six months.</p>
