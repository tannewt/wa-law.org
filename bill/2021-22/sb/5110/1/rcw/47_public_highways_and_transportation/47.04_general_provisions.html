<p>The department shall establish a process for issuing a lease for the use of the right-of-way by a service provider and shall require that telecommunications equipment be colocated on the same structure whenever practicable. Consistent with federal highway administration approval, the lease must include the right of direct ingress and egress from the highway for construction and maintenance of the personal wireless service facility during nonpeak hours if public safety is not adversely affected. Direct ingress and egress may be allowed at any time for the construction of the facility if public safety is not adversely affected and if construction will not substantially interfere with traffic flow during peak traffic periods. The lease may specify an indirect ingress and egress to the facility if it is reasonable and available for the particular location.</p>

<p>Federal funds that are administered by the department of transportation and are passed through to municipal corporations or political subdivisions of the state and moneys that are received as total reimbursement for goods, services, or projects constructed by the department of transportation are removed from the transportation budget. To process and account for these expenditures a new treasury trust account is created to be used for all department of transportation one hundred percent federal and local reimbursable transportation expenditures. This new account is nonbudgeted and nonappropriated. At the same time, federal and private local appropriations and full-time equivalents in subprograms R2, R3, T6, Y6, and Z2 processed through this new account are removed from the department of transportation's 1997-99 budget.</p>
<p>The department of transportation may make expenditures from the account before receiving federal and local reimbursements. However, at the end of each biennium, the account must maintain a zero or positive cash balance. In the twenty-fourth month of each biennium the department of transportation shall calculate and transfer sufficient cash from either the motor vehicle fund or the multimodal transportation account to cover any negative cash balances. The amount transferred is calculated based on expenditures from each fund. In addition, any interest charges accruing to the new account must be distributed to the motor vehicle fund and the multimodal transportation account.</p>
<p>The department of transportation shall provide an annual report to the senate and house transportation committees and the office of financial management on expenditures and full-time equivalents processed through the new account.

<ol>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section only, &quot;assault&quot; means an act by a motorist that results in physical injury to an employee of the department while engaged in highway construction or maintenance activities along a roadway right-of-way (fence line to fence line, landscaped areas) or in the loading and unloading of passenger vehicles in service of the vessel as a maritime employee not covered under chapter 51.32 RCW or engaged in those work activities as a Washington state ferries terminal employee covered under chapter 51.32 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In recognition of the nature of employment in departmental highway construction or maintenance activities and by the Washington state ferries, this section provides a supplementary program to reimburse employees of the department for some of their costs attributable to their being the victims of assault by motorists. This program is limited to the reimbursement provided in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An employee is entitled to receive the reimbursement provided in this section only if the secretary finds that each of the following has occurred:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A motorist has assaulted the employee who is engaged in highway construction or maintenance along a roadway right-of-way (fence line to fence line, landscaped areas) or service of the vessel as a maritime employee or terminal employee engaged in the loading or unloading of passenger vehicles and as a result the employee has sustained demonstrated physical injuries that have required the employee to miss one or more days of work;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The assault is not attributable to any extent to the employee's negligence, misconduct, or failure to comply with any rules or conditions of employment; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of labor and industries has approved the employee's workers' compensation application under chapter 51.32 RCW, or for maritime employees the department of transportation risk management office has approved maintenance and cure benefits under 46 U.S.C. Sec. 688 et seq.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reimbursement authorized under this section is as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The employee's accumulated sick leave days will not be reduced for the workdays missed. The injured worker who qualifies for and receives assault benefits will also receive full standard benefits (vacation leave, sick leave, health insurance, etc.) as if uninjured;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For an employee covered by chapter 51.32 RCW, for each workday missed for which the employee is not eligible to receive compensation under chapter 51.32 RCW, the employee will receive the full amount of the injured worker's net pay at the time of injury; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In respect to workdays missed for which the employee will receive or has received compensation under chapter 51.32 RCW, or under federal maritime law benefits, including the Jones Act, for an employee deemed a maritime employee assigned to work in service of the vessel or a nonmaritime terminal employee covered under chapter 51.32 RCW, the employee will be reimbursed in an amount that, when added to that compensation, will result in the employee receiving no more than full net pay (gross pay less mandatory and voluntary deductions) for the workdays missed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reimbursement under this section may not last longer than three hundred sixty-five consecutive days after the date of the injury. No application for assault benefits is valid nor may a claim be enforced unless it was made within one year after the day upon which the injury occurred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The employee is not entitled to the reimbursement provided in subsection (4) of this section for a workday for which the secretary or an applicable designee finds that the employee has not diligently pursued his or her compensation remedies under chapter 51.32 RCW or federal maritime law, including the Jones Act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reimbursement may be made only for absences that the secretary or an applicable designee believes are justified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the employee is receiving reimbursement under this section, he or she will continue to be classified as a state employee, and the reimbursement amount is considered as salary or wages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall make all reimbursement payments required to be made to employees under this section. The payments are considered as a salary or wage expense and must be paid by the department in the same manner and from the same appropriations as other salary and wage expenses for the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section precludes the department from recovering the supplemental payments authorized by this section from the assaulting motorist, and that recovery is considered exclusive of recovery under chapter 51.24 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the legislature revokes the reimbursement authorized under this section or repeals this section, no affected employee is entitled after that to receive the reimbursement as a matter of contractual right.</p>
