<p>An environmental board may issue a certificate of appealability if it finds that delay in obtaining a final and prompt determination of the issues would be detrimental to any party or the public interest and either:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Fundamental and urgent statewide or regional issues are raised; or</p>

<p>If an issue on review is the jurisdiction of the environmental board, the board may file an application for direct review on that issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The environmental board shall have thirty days to grant or deny the request for a certificate of appealability and its decision shall be filed with the superior court and served on all parties of record.</p>
