<li>
<p>It is the intent of this chapter to impose a tax only once for each hazardous substance possessed in this state and to tax the first possession of all hazardous substances, including substances and products that the department of ecology determines to present a threat to human health or the environment. However, it is not intended to impose a tax on the first possession of small amounts of any hazardous substance (other than petroleum and pesticide products) that is first possessed by a retailer for the purpose of sale to ultimate consumers. This chapter is not intended to exempt any person from tax liability under any other law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the specific purpose of the model toxics control reform act (chapter 422, Laws of 2019) to update the model toxics control program and its primary funding mechanism. These reforms are intended to achieve the financial stability, transparency, and long-term protection of revenues. Specifically, this reform act makes the following changes:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Increases funding for programs and projects related to clean air, clean water, toxic cleanup, and prevention, with specific focus on stormwater pollution;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides distinct and transparent financial separation of capital and operating budget funding under the model toxics control program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improves the transparency and visibility of operating and capital project expenditures under the model toxics control program; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eliminates the year-to-year volatility of hazardous substance tax revenues by moving to a volumetric rate for petroleum products.</p>
