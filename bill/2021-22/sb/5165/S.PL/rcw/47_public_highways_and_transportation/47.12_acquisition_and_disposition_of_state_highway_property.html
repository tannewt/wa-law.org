<p>Whenever it is necessary to secure any lands or interests in land for a right-of-way for any state highway, or for the drainage thereof or construction of a protection therefor or so as to afford unobstructed vision therefor toward any railroad crossing or another public highway crossing or any point of danger to public travel or to provide a visual or sound buffer between highways and adjacent properties or for the purpose of acquiring sand pits, gravel pits, borrow pits, stone quarries, or any other land for the extraction of materials for construction or maintenance or both, or for any site for the erection upon and use as a maintenance camp, of any state highway, or any site for other necessary structures or for structures for the health and accommodation of persons traveling or stopping upon the state highways of this state, or any site for the construction and maintenance of structures and facilities adjacent to, under, upon, within, or above the right-of-way of any state highway for exclusive or nonexclusive use by an urban public transportation system, or for any other highway purpose, together with right-of-way to reach such property and gain access thereto, the department of transportation is authorized to acquire such lands or interests in land in behalf of the state by gift, purchase, or condemnation. In case of condemnation to secure such lands or interests in land, the action shall be brought in the name of the state of Washington in the manner provided for the acquiring of property for the public uses of the state, and in such action the selection of the lands or interests in land by the secretary of transportation shall, in the absence of bad faith, arbitrary, capricious, or fraudulent action, be conclusive upon the court and judge before which the action is brought that said lands or interests in land are necessary for public use for the purposes sought. The cost and expense of such lands or interests in land may be paid as a part of the cost of the state highway for which such right-of-way, drainage, unobstructed vision, sand pits, gravel pits, borrow pits, stone quarries, maintenance camp sites, and structure sites or other lands are acquired.</p>

<li>
<p>Except as provided in RCW 47.12.026 and 47.12.029, whenever it is necessary to secure any lands or interests in lands for any highway purpose mentioned in RCW 47.12.010, or for the construction of any toll facility or ferry terminal or docking facility, the title to which is in the state of Washington and under the jurisdiction of the department of natural resources, the department of transportation may acquire jurisdiction over the lands or interests in lands, or acquire rights to remove materials from the lands in the manner set forth in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At any time after the final adoption of a right-of-way plan or other plan requiring the acquisition of lands or interests in lands for any purpose as authorized in subsection (1) of this section, the department of transportation may file with the department of natural resources a notice setting forth its intent to acquire jurisdiction of the lands or interests in lands under the jurisdiction of the department of natural resources required for right-of-way or other highway purposes related to the construction or improvement of such state highway, toll facility, or ferry terminal or docking facility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of transportation at the time of filing its notice of intent as provided in subsection (2) of this section shall file therewith a written statement showing the total amount of just compensation to be paid for the property in the event of settlement. The offer shall be based upon the department of transportation approved appraisal of the fair market value of the property to be acquired. In no event may the offer of settlement be referred to or used during any arbitration proceeding or trial conducted for the purpose of determining the amount of just compensation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just compensation and/or fair market value for the purposes of this section shall be determined in accordance with applicable federal and state constitutional, statutory, and case law relating to the condemnation of private and public property for public purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the department of natural resources does not accept the offer of the department of transportation, the department of transportation may nonetheless pay to the department of natural resources the amount of its offer and obtain immediate possession and use of the property pending the determination of just compensation in the manner hereinafter provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the amount of just compensation is not agreed to, either the department of natural resources or the department of transportation may request in writing the appointment of an arbitrator for the purpose of determining the amount of compensation to be paid by the department of transportation for the acquisition of jurisdiction over the lands or interests in lands or rights therein. In that event the department of natural resources and the department of transportation may jointly agree on an arbitrator to determine the compensation, and his or her determination shall be final and conclusive upon both departments. The costs of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the parties. If the department of natural resources and the department of transportation are unable to agree on the selection of an arbitrator within thirty days after a request therefor is made, either the department of transportation or the department of natural resources may file a petition with the superior court for Thurston county for the purpose of determining the amount of just compensation to be paid. The matter shall be tried by the court pursuant to the procedures set forth in RCW 8.04.080.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever the department of transportation has acquired immediate possession and use of property by payment of the amount of its offer to the department of natural resources, and the arbitration award or judgment of the court for the acquisition exceeds the payment for immediate possession and use, the department of transportation shall forthwith pay the amount of such excess to the department of natural resources with interest thereon from the date it obtained immediate possession. If the arbitration or court award is less than the amount previously paid by the department of transportation for immediate possession and use, the department of natural resources shall forthwith pay the amount of the difference to the department of transportation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon the payment of just compensation, as agreed to by the department of transportation and the department of natural resources, or as determined by arbitration or by judgment of the court, and other costs or fees as provided by statute, the department of natural resources shall cause to be executed and delivered to the department of transportation an instrument transferring jurisdiction over the lands or interests in lands, or rights to remove material from the lands, to the department of transportation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in RCW 47.12.026, whenever the department of transportation ceases to use any lands or interests in lands acquired in the manner set forth in this section for the purposes mentioned herein, the department of natural resources may reacquire jurisdiction over the lands or interests in land by paying the fair market value thereof to the department of transportation. If the two departments are unable to agree on the fair market value of the lands or interests in lands, the market value shall be determined and the interests therein shall be transferred in accordance with the provisions and procedures set forth in subsections (4) through (8) of this section.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The department of transportation may obtain an easement for highway or toll facilities purposes or for ferry terminal or docking facilities on, over, or across harbor areas in accordance with RCW 47.12.023 but only when the areas are approved by the harbor line commission as a public place for public landings, wharves, or other public conveniences of commerce or navigation. No charge may be made to the department of transportation for such an easement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon the selection by the department of transportation of an easement for highway or toll facilities right-of-way or for ferry terminal or docking facilities, as authorized in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the department of natural resources shall cause to be executed and delivered to the department of transportation an instrument transferring the easement. Whenever the state no longer requires the easement for highway or toll facilities right-of-way or for ferry terminal or docking facilities, the easement shall automatically terminate and the department of transportation shall, upon request, cause to be executed an instrument relinquishing to the department of natural resources all of its interest in the lands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of transportation, pursuant to the procedures set forth in RCW 47.12.023, may remove sand and gravel and borrow materials and stone from the beds of navigable waters under the jurisdiction of the department of natural resources which lie below the line of ordinary high water upon the payment of fair market value per cubic yard for such materials to be determined in the manner set forth in RCW 47.12.023.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of transportation may acquire full jurisdiction over lands under the jurisdiction of the department of natural resources including the beds of navigable waters that are required for the relocation of the operating tracks of any railroad that will be displaced by the acquisition of such railroad property for state highway purposes. The department of transportation may exchange lands so acquired in consideration or partial consideration for the land or property rights needed for highway purposes and may cause to be executed a conveyance of the lands in the manner prescribed in RCW 47.12.150. In that event the department of transportation shall pay to the department of natural resources, as just compensation for the acquisition, the fair market value of the property, including the beds of any navigable waters, to be determined in accordance with procedures set forth in RCW 47.12.023.</p>

<p>Whenever it is necessary to secure any lands for primary or secondary state highway right-of-way or other state highway purposes, the title to which is in any county of the state or in any political or municipal subdivision of the state, which land is not at the time being used as a public highway, the county legislative authority or the board of directors or governing body of any such political or municipal subdivision are authorized to directly lease, sell, or convey by gift the land or any interest therein to the state of Washington, without requiring competitive bids or notice to the public, and at such price as the legislative authority, directors, or governing body may deem for the best interests of the county or for the best interests of the political or municipal subdivision of the state. The county legislative authority or the directors or governing body of any political or municipal subdivision are empowered to execute a deed or other proper instrument to the land, passing title to the state of Washington, and the instrument need not require consideration other than the benefit which may be derived by the grantor on account of the use thereof. Whenever any state highway is established by legislative enactment and the state highway is upon the former route of a county road, the county legislative authority shall cause the title to the existing right-of-way or so much thereof as the department requires to be transferred to the state of Washington by proper instrument.</p>

<li>
<p>Whenever the department determines that any real property owned by the state of Washington and under the jurisdiction of the department is no longer required for transportation purposes and that it is in the public interest to do so, the department may sell the property or exchange it in full or part consideration for land or building improvements or for construction of highway improvements at fair market value to any person through the solicitation of written bids through public advertising in the manner prescribed under RCW 47.28.050 or in the manner prescribed under RCW 47.12.283.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Any abutting private owner but only after each other abutting private owner (if any), as shown in the records of the county assessor, is notified in writing of the proposed sale. If more than one abutting private owner requests in writing the right to purchase the property within fifteen days after receiving notice of the proposed sale, the property shall be sold at public auction in the manner provided in RCW 47.12.283;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To any other owner of real property required for transportation purposes;</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>When selling real property pursuant to RCW 47.12.283, the department may withhold or withdraw the property from an auction when requested by one of the entities or persons listed in subsection (3) of this section and only after the receipt of a nonrefundable deposit equal to ten percent of the fair market value of the real property or five thousand dollars, whichever is less. This subsection does not prohibit the department from exercising its discretion to withhold or withdraw the real property from an auction if the department determines that the property is no longer surplus or chooses to sell the property through one of the other means listed in subsection (2) of this section. If a transaction under this subsection is not completed within sixty days, the real property must be put back up for sale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sales to purchasers may, at the department's option, be for cash, by real estate contract, or exchange of land or highway improvements. Transactions involving the construction of improvements must be conducted pursuant to chapter 47.28 RCW and Title 39 RCW, as applicable, and must comply with all other applicable laws and rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conveyances made pursuant to this section shall be by deed executed by the secretary of transportation and shall be duly acknowledged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise provided, all moneys received pursuant to the provisions of this section less any real estate broker commissions paid pursuant to RCW 47.12.320 shall be deposited in the motor vehicle fund.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The department may sell the personal property at public auction after due notice has been given in accordance with general rules adopted by the secretary. The department may set minimum prices that will be accepted for any item offered for sale at public auction as provided in this section and may prescribe terms or conditions of sale. If an item is offered for sale at the auction and no satisfactory bids are received or the amount bid is less than the minimum set by the department, the department may sell the item at private sale for the best price that it deems obtainable, but not less than the highest price bid at the public auction. The proceeds of all sales under this section must be placed in the motor vehicle fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may issue permits to residents of this state to remove specified quantities of standing or downed trees and shrubs, rock, sand, gravel, or soils that have no market value in place and that the department desires to be removed from state-owned lands that are under the jurisdiction of the department. An applicant for a permit must certify that the materials so removed are to be used by the applicant and that they will not be disposed of to any other person. Removal of materials under the permit must be in accordance with rules adopted by the department. The fee for a permit is two dollars and fifty cents, which fee must be deposited in the motor vehicle fund. The department may adopt rules providing for special access to limited access facilities for the purpose of removal of materials under permits authorized in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may sell timber or logs to an abutting landowner for cash at full appraised value, but only after each other abutting owner (if any), as shown in the records of the county assessor, is notified in writing of the proposed sale. If more than one abutting owner requests in writing the right to purchase the timber within fifteen days after receiving notice of the proposed sale, the timber must be sold in accordance with subsection (1) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may sell timber or logs having an appraised value of one thousand dollars or less directly to interested parties for cash at the full appraised value without notice or advertising.

<p>It is declared to be the public policy of the state of Washington to provide for the acquisition of real property and engineering costs necessary for the improvement of the state highway system, in advance of actual construction, for the purposes of eliminating costly delays in construction, reducing hardship to owners of the property, and eliminating economic waste occasioned by the improvement of such property immediately prior to its acquisition for highway uses.</p>
<p>The legislature therefore finds and declares that purchase and condemnation of real property necessary for the state highway system and engineering costs, reasonably in advance of programmed construction, is a public use and purpose and a highway purpose.</p>
<p>The department is hereby authorized to purchase or condemn any real property or property rights therein which it deems will be necessary for the improvement of routes on the state highway system by the method provided in RCW 47.12.180 through 47.12.240 or alternatively by the method provided in RCW 47.12.242 through 47.12.246. Neither method may be used to condemn property or property rights in advance of programmed construction until the department has complied with hearing procedures required for the location or relocation of the type of highway for which the property is to be condemned.</p>

<p>For the purpose of environmental mitigation of transportation projects, the department may acquire or develop, or both acquire and develop, environmental mitigation sites in advance of the construction of programmed projects. The term &quot;advanced environmental mitigation&quot; means mitigation of adverse impacts upon the environment from transportation projects before their design and construction. Advanced environmental mitigation consists of the acquisition of property; the acquisition of property, water, or air rights; the development of property for the purposes of improved environmental management; engineering costs necessary for such purchase and development; and the use of advanced environmental mitigation sites to fulfill project environmental permit requirements. Advanced environmental mitigation must be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the definition of mitigation found in the council of environmental quality regulations (40 C.F.R. Sec. 1508.20) and the governor's executive order on wetlands (EO 90-04). Advanced environmental mitigation is for projects approved by the transportation commission as part of the state's six-year plan or included in the state highway system plan. Advanced environmental mitigation must give consideration to activities related to fish passage, fish habitat, wetlands, and flood management. Advanced environmental mitigation may also be conducted in partnership with federal, state, or local government agencies, tribal governments, interest groups, or private parties. Partnership arrangements may include joint acquisition and development of mitigation sites, purchasing and selling mitigation bank credits among participants, and transfer of mitigation site title from one party to another. Specific conditions of partnership arrangements will be developed in written agreements for each applicable environmental mitigation site.</p>
