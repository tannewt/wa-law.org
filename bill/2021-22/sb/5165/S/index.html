<p>The Washington state patrol is directed to terminate its &quot;Agreement for Utility Connection and Reimbursement of Water Extension Expenses&quot; with the city of Shelton, executed on June 12, 2017, subject to the city of Shelton's consent to terminate the agreement.

The legislature also finds that the water connection provides an ongoing water supply that is necessary to the operation of the training facility, that the state is making use of the water connection for these public activities, and that any future incidental use of the municipal infrastructure put in place to support these activities will not impede the Washington state patrol's ongoing use of the water connection extension.</p>

<li>
<p>For projects identified as connecting Washington projects and supported by revenues under chapter 44, Laws of 2015 3rd sp. sess., it is the priority of the legislature that the department deliver the named projects. The legislature encourages the department to continue to institutionalize innovation and collaboration in design and project delivery with an eye toward the most efficient use of resources. In doing so, the legislature expects that, for some projects, costs will be reduced during the project design phase due to the application of practical design. However, significant changes to a project title or scope arising from the application of practical design requires legislative approval. The legislature will utilize existing mechanisms and processes to ensure timely and efficient approval. Practical design-related changes to the scope may be proposed by the department, for the legislature's approval, only if the project's intended performance is substantially unchanged and the local governments and interested stakeholders impacted by the project have been consulted and have reviewed the proposed changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the greatest extent practicable, a contract for the construction of a project with any change to the title or scope, whether significant or not, arising from the application of practical design must not be let until the department has provided a detailed notice describing the change to the chairs and ranking members of the house of representatives and senate transportation committees or, if during the interim, to the joint transportation committee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To determine the savings attributable to practical design, each connecting Washington project must be evaluated. For design-bid-build projects, the evaluation must occur at the end of the project design phase. For design-build projects, the evaluation must occur at the completion of thirty percent design. Each year as a part of its annual budget submittal, the department must include a detailed summary of how practical design has been applied and the associated savings gained. The annual summary must also include for each project: Details regarding any savings gained specifically through changes in the cost of materials, changes in the scope of a project and associated impacts on risk, the retirement of any risk reserves, and unused contingency funds.</p>

<p>The transportation future funding program is intended to provide for future emergent transportation projects, accelerating the schedule for existing connecting Washington projects, and highway preservation investments, beginning in fiscal year 2024, based on savings accrued from the application of practical design and any retired risk or unused contingency funding on connecting Washington projects. <strong>However, for the 2021-2023 biennium the transportation future funding program may be used to fund fish passage barrier removal projects.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning July 1, 2016, the department must submit a report to the state treasurer and the transportation committees of the legislature once every six months identifying the amount of savings attributable to the application of practical design, retired risk, and unused contingency funding, and report when the savings become available. The state treasurer must transfer the available amounts identified in the report to the transportation future funding program account created in RCW 46.68.396.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning in fiscal year 2024, as a part of its budget submittal, the department may provide a list of highway improvement projects or preservation investments for potential legislative approval as part of the transportation future funding program. Highway improvement projects considered for inclusion under the transportation future funding program may include new connecting Washington projects, or accelerate the schedule for existing connecting Washington projects, and must: Address significant safety concerns; alleviate congestion and advance mobility; provide compelling economic development gains; leverage partnership funds from local, federal, or other sources; or require a next phase of funding to build upon initial investments provided by the legislature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that if savings attributable to the application of practical design are used to accelerate existing connecting Washington projects, savings must also be used for new connecting Washington projects of equal cost.</p>

<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/34_administrative_law/34.05_administrative_procedure_act.html">34.05.350</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/34_administrative_law/34.05_administrative_procedure_act.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If an agency for good cause finds:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>That immediate adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule is necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety, or general welfare, and that observing the time requirements of notice and opportunity to comment upon adoption of a permanent rule would be contrary to the public interest;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That state or federal law or federal rule or a federal deadline for state receipt of federal funds requires immediate adoption of a rule; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to implement the requirements or reductions in appropriations enacted in any budget for fiscal year 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012,  2013, <strong>or in an omnibus transportation appropriations act for the 2021-2023 biennium related to setting toll rates or ferry fares,</strong> which necessitates the need for the immediate adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, and that observing the time requirements of notice and opportunity to comment upon adoption of a permanent rule would be contrary to the fiscal needs or requirements of the agency,</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>the agency may dispense with those requirements and adopt, amend, or repeal the rule on an emergency basis. The agency's finding and a concise statement of the reasons for its finding shall be incorporated in the order for adoption of the emergency rule or amendment filed with the office of the code reviser under RCW 34.05.380 and with the rules review committee.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>An emergency rule adopted under this section takes effect upon filing with the code reviser, unless a later date is specified in the order of adoption, and may not remain in effect for longer than one hundred twenty days after filing. Identical or substantially similar emergency rules may not be adopted in sequence unless conditions have changed or the agency has filed notice of its intent to adopt the rule as a permanent rule, and is actively undertaking the appropriate procedures to adopt the rule as a permanent rule. This section does not relieve any agency from compliance with any law requiring that its permanent rules be approved by designated persons or bodies before they become effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within seven days after the rule is adopted, any person may petition the governor requesting the immediate repeal of a rule adopted on an emergency basis by any department listed in RCW 43.17.010. Within seven days after submission of the petition, the governor shall either deny the petition in writing, stating his or her reasons for the denial, or order the immediate repeal of the rule. In ruling on the petition, the governor shall consider only whether the conditions in subsection (1) of this section were met such that adoption of the rule on an emergency basis was necessary. If the governor orders the repeal of the emergency rule, any sanction imposed based on that rule is void. This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit adoption of any rule as a permanent rule.</p>
