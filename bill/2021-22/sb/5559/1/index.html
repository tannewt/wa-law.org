<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/49_labor_regulations/49.46_minimum_wage_requirements_and_labor_standards.html">49.46.210</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/49_labor_regulations/49.46_minimum_wage_requirements_and_labor_standards.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Beginning January 1, 2018, except as provided in RCW 49.46.180, every employer shall provide each of its employees paid sick leave as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>An employee shall accrue at least one hour of paid sick leave for every forty hours worked as an employee. An employer may provide paid sick leave in advance of accrual provided that such front-loading meets or exceeds the requirements of this section for accrual, use, and carryover of paid sick leave.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An employee is authorized to use paid sick leave for the following reasons:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>An absence resulting from an employee's mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; to accommodate the employee's need for medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; or an employee's need for preventive medical care;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To allow the employee to provide care for a family member with a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; care of a family member who needs medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; or care for a family member who needs preventive medical care; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the employee's place of business has been closed by order of a public official for any health-related reason, or when an employee's child's school or place of care has been closed for such a reason.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An employee is authorized to use paid sick leave for absences that qualify for leave under the domestic violence leave act, chapter 49.76 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An employee is entitled to use accrued paid sick leave beginning on the ninetieth calendar day after the commencement of his or her employment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Employers are not prevented from providing more generous paid sick leave policies or permitting use of paid sick leave for additional purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An employer may require employees to give reasonable notice of an absence from work, so long as such notice does not interfere with an employee's lawful use of paid sick leave.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(i) <strong>Except as provided in (g)(iii) of this subsection, for</strong> absences exceeding three days, an employer may require verification that an employee's use of paid sick leave is for an authorized purpose. If an employer requires verification, verification must be provided to the employer within a reasonable time period during or after the leave.</p>
<ol type="i" start="2">
<li>An employer's requirements for verification may not result in an unreasonable burden or expense on the employee and may not exceed privacy or verification requirements otherwise established by law.</li>
</ol>
<p>iii.(A) <strong>For verification for an authorized purpose under (b)(i) of this subsection for absences exceeding three days, an employer who does not offer a health insurance plan as an employee benefit and pays at least 85 percent of the cost of the insurance:</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(I) <strong>May only require an oral or written explanation provided by the employee as verification that an employee's use of paid sick leave is for the authorized purpose; and</strong></p>
<p>(II) <strong>May not require a medical examination or statement from a health care provider.</strong></p>
<p>(B) <strong>Any verification under this subsection (1)(g)(iii) must also be consistent with any rules adopted by the department of labor and industries.</strong></p>
<pre><code>h. An employer may not require, as a condition of an employee taking paid sick leave, that the employee search for or find a replacement worker to cover the hours during which the employee is on paid sick leave.

i. For each hour of paid sick leave used, an employee shall be paid the greater of the minimum hourly wage rate established in this chapter or his or her normal hourly compensation. The employer is responsible for providing regular notification to employees about the amount of paid sick leave available to the employee.

j. Unused paid sick leave carries over to the following year, except that an employer is not required to allow an employee to carry over paid sick leave in excess of forty hours.

k. This section does not require an employer to provide financial or other reimbursement for accrued and unused paid sick leave to any employee upon the employee's termination, resignation, retirement, or other separation from employment. When there is a separation from employment and the employee is rehired within twelve months of separation by the same employer, whether at the same or a different business location of the employer, previously accrued unused paid sick leave shall be reinstated and the previous period of employment shall be counted for purposes of determining the employee's eligibility to use paid sick leave under (d) of this **subsection**.
