<p><strong>The ethics boards shall adopt rules at each of their agencies describing a process for a person to seek a waiver from the postemployment requirements in subsection (6)(d) and (e) of this section.

The ethics boards are authorized to delegate waiver approval to the chair or the chair's designee, including the executive director. Before granting a waiver, the board must find that:</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p><strong>The postemployment activity presents no conflict with the state's interest;</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/42_public_officers_and_agencies/42.52_ethics_in_public_service.html">42.52.900</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/42_public_officers_and_agencies/42.52_ethics_in_public_service.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Government derives its powers from the people. Ethics in government are the foundation on which the structure of government rests. State officials and employees of government hold a public trust that obligates them, in a special way, to honesty and integrity in fulfilling the responsibilities to which they are elected and appointed. Paramount in that trust is the principle that public office, whether elected or appointed, may not be used for personal gain or private advantage.</p>
<p>The citizens of the state expect all state officials and employees to perform their public responsibilities in accordance with the highest ethical and moral standards and to conduct the business of the state only in a manner that advances the public's interest. State officials and employees are subject to the sanctions of law and scrutiny of the media; ultimately, however, they are accountable to the people and must consider this public accountability as a particular obligation of the public service. Only when affairs of government are conducted, at all levels, with openness as provided by law and an unswerving commitment to the public good does government work as it should.</p>
<p>The obligations of government rest equally on the state's citizenry. The effectiveness of government depends, fundamentally, on the confidence citizens can have in the judgments and decisions of their elected representatives. Citizens, therefore, should honor and respect the principles and the spirit of representative democracy, recognizing that both elected and appointed officials, together with state employees, seek to carry out their public duties with professional skill and dedication to the public interest. Such service merits public recognition and support.</p>
<p>All who have the privilege of working for the people of Washington state can have but one aim: To give the highest public service to its citizens.</p>
<p><strong>Furthermore, the legislature finds that the state has a compelling interest in preserving the public trust in the integrity of our government and ensuring that the actions of state employees are free from improper influence. The ability of a former public officer or employee in state government to be paid to influence state government actions immediately after leaving state service creates the appearance to the public of special favor, unfair access, and conflicts of interest. The practice of paying former public servants in state government to use their special knowledge of internal agency process and personal relationships with former colleagues to gain influence for private and special interests should be tempered for a period of time to protect the public interest.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A majority of states, as well as the federal government, have enacted laws requiring a cooling off period or other postgovernment employment laws addressing when a former public officer may lobby government or seek to influence his or her former employer. These laws impose anywhere from a one-year to a lifetime ban on certain postemployment activities. A cooling off period can effectively reduce the leverage a former officer or high-level employee has when he or she is paid to influence policy decisions within the authority of his or her former employer or former duties, until that influence is mitigated through the passage of time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The disclosure by former state officers and high-level employees of their postemployment income sources will strengthen transparency and confidence in the integrity of government.</strong></p>
