<p>This section provides uniform small works roster provisions to award contracts for construction, building, renovation, remodeling, alteration, repair, or improvement of real property that may be used by state agencies and by any local government that is expressly authorized to use these provisions. These provisions may be used in lieu of other procedures to award contracts for such work with an estimated cost of three hundred fifty thousand dollars or less. The small works roster process includes the limited public works process authorized under subsection (3) of this section and any local government authorized to award contracts using the small works roster process under this section may award contracts using the limited public works process under subsection (3) of this section.</p>

<li>
<p>A state agency or authorized local government may create a single general small works roster, or may create a small works roster for different specialties or categories of anticipated work. Where applicable, small works rosters may make distinctions between contractors based upon different geographic areas served by the contractor. The small works roster or rosters shall consist of all responsible contractors who have requested to be on the list, and where required by law are properly licensed or registered to perform such work in this state. A state agency or local government establishing a small works roster or rosters may require eligible contractors desiring to be placed on a roster or rosters to keep current records of any applicable licenses, certifications, registrations, bonding, insurance, or other appropriate matters on file with the state agency or local government as a condition of being placed on a roster or rosters. At least once a year, the state agency or local government shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation within the jurisdiction a notice of the existence of the roster or rosters and solicit the names of contractors for such roster or rosters. In addition, responsible contractors shall be added to an appropriate roster or rosters at any time they submit a written request and necessary records. Master contracts may be required to be signed that become effective when a specific award is made using a small works roster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A state agency establishing a small works roster or rosters shall adopt rules implementing this subsection. A local government establishing a small works roster or rosters shall adopt an ordinance or resolution implementing this subsection. Procedures included in rules adopted by the department of enterprise services in implementing this subsection must be included in any rules providing for a small works roster or rosters that is adopted by another state agency, if the authority for that state agency to engage in these activities has been delegated to it by the department of enterprise services under chapter 43.19 RCW. An interlocal contract or agreement between two or more state agencies or local governments establishing a small works roster or rosters to be used by the parties to the agreement or contract must clearly identify the lead entity that is responsible for implementing the provisions of this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Procedures shall be established for securing telephone, written, or electronic quotations from contractors on the appropriate small works roster to assure that a competitive price is established and to award contracts to the lowest responsible bidder, as defined in RCW 39.04.010. Invitations for quotations shall include an estimate of the scope and nature of the work to be performed as well as materials and equipment to be furnished. However, detailed plans and specifications need not be included in the invitation. This subsection does not eliminate other requirements for architectural or engineering approvals as to quality and compliance with building codes. Quotations may be invited from all appropriate contractors on the appropriate small works roster. As an alternative, quotations may be invited from at least five contractors on the appropriate small works roster who have indicated the capability of performing the kind of work being contracted, in a manner that will equitably distribute the opportunity among the contractors on the appropriate roster. However, if the estimated cost of the work is from two hundred fifty thousand dollars to three hundred fifty thousand dollars, a state agency or local government that chooses to solicit bids from less than all the appropriate contractors on the appropriate small works roster must also notify the remaining contractors on the appropriate small works roster that quotations on the work are being sought. The government has the sole option of determining whether this notice to the remaining contractors is made by: (i) Publishing notice in a legal newspaper in general circulation in the area where the work is to be done; (ii) mailing a notice to these contractors; or (iii) sending a notice to these contractors by facsimile or other electronic means. For purposes of this subsection (2)(c), &quot;equitably distribute&quot; means that a state agency or local government soliciting bids may not favor certain contractors on the appropriate small works roster over other contractors on the appropriate small works roster who perform similar services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A contract awarded from a small works roster under this section need not be advertised.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Immediately after an award is made, the bid quotations obtained shall be recorded, open to public inspection, and available by at least one of the following: Telephone or electronic request.</p>

<p>For projects awarded under the small works roster process established under this subsection, a state agency or authorized local government may waive the retainage requirements of RCW 60.28.011(1)(a), thereby assuming the liability for contractor's nonpayment of: (i) Laborers, mechanics, subcontractors, materialpersons, and suppliers; and (ii) taxes, increases, and penalties under Titles 50, 51, and 82 RCW that may be due from the contractor for the project. However, the state agency or local government has the right of recovery against the contractor for any payments made on the contractor's behalf.

A state agency or authorized local government must equitably distribute opportunities for limited public works projects among contractors willing to perform in the geographic area of the work. A state agency or authorized local government shall maintain a list of the contractors contacted and the contracts awarded during the previous twenty-four months under the limited public works process, including the name of the contractor, the contractor's registration number, the amount of the contract, a brief description of the type of work performed, and the date the contract was awarded. For limited public works projects, a state agency or authorized local government may waive the payment and performance bond requirements of chapter 39.08 RCW and may waive the retainage requirements of RCW 60.28.011(1)(a), thereby assuming the liability for the contractor's nonpayment of laborers, mechanics, subcontractors, materialpersons, suppliers, and taxes, increases, and penalties imposed under Titles 50, 51, and 82 RCW that may be due from the contractor for the limited public works project, however the state agency or authorized local government shall have the right of recovery against the contractor for any payments made on the contractor's behalf.</p>

<p>The legislature recognizes that fair and open competition is a basic tenet of public works procurement, that such competition reduces the appearance of and opportunity for favoritism and inspires public confidence that contracts are awarded equitably and economically, and that effective monitoring mechanisms are important means of curbing any improprieties and establishing public confidence in the process by which contractual services are procured. The legislature finds that there will continue to exist a need for additional correctional facilities due to the inadequate capacity of existing correctional facilities to accommodate the predicted growth of offender populations and that it is necessary to provide public works contract options for the effective construction and repair of additional department of corrections facilities.</p>

<p>In addition to currently authorized methods of public works contracting, and in lieu of the requirements of RCW 39.04.010 and 39.04.020 through 39.04.060, capital projects funded for over ten million dollars authorized by the legislature for the department of corrections to construct or repair facilities may be accomplished under contract using the general contractor/construction manager method described in this section. In addition, the general contractor/construction manager method may be used for up to two demonstration projects under ten million dollars for the department of corrections. Each demonstration project shall aggregate capital projects authorized by the legislature at a single site to total no less than three million dollars with the approval of the office of financial management. The department of enterprise services shall present its plan for the aggregation of projects under each demonstration project to the oversight advisory committee established under subsection (2) of this section prior to soliciting proposals for general contractor/construction manager services for the demonstration project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;general contractor/construction manager&quot; means a firm with which the department of enterprise services has selected and negotiated a maximum allowable construction cost to be guaranteed by the firm, after competitive selection through a formal advertisement, and competitive bids to provide services during the design phase that may include life-cycle cost design considerations, value engineering, scheduling, cost estimating, constructability, alternative construction options for cost savings, and sequencing of work, and to act as the construction manager and general contractor during the construction phase. The department of enterprise services shall establish an independent oversight advisory committee with representatives of interest groups with an interest in this subject area, the department of corrections, and the private sector, to review selection and contracting procedures and contracting documents. The oversight advisory committee shall discuss and review the progress of the demonstration projects. The general contractor/construction manager method is limited to projects authorized on or before July 1, 1997.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contracts for the services of a general contractor/construction manager awarded under the authority of this section shall be awarded through a competitive process requiring the public solicitation of proposals for general contractor/construction manager services. Minority and women enterprise total project goals shall be specified in the bid instructions to the general contractor/construction manager finalists. The director of enterprise services is authorized to include an incentive clause in any contract awarded under this section for savings of either time or cost or both from that originally negotiated. No incentives granted shall exceed five percent of the maximum allowable construction cost. The director of enterprise services or his or her designee shall establish a committee to evaluate the proposals considering such factors as: Ability of professional personnel; past performance in negotiated and complex projects; ability to meet time and budget requirements; location; recent, current, and projected workloads of the firm; and the concept of their proposal. After the committee has selected the most qualified finalists, these finalists shall submit sealed bids for the percent fee, which is the percentage amount to be earned by the general contractor/construction manager as overhead and profit, on the estimated maximum allowable construction cost and the fixed amount for the detailed specified general conditions work. The maximum allowable construction cost may be negotiated between the department of enterprise services and the selected firm after the scope of the project is adequately determined to establish a guaranteed contract cost for which the general contractor/construction manager will provide a performance and payment bond. The guaranteed contract cost includes the fixed amount for the detailed specified general conditions work, the negotiated maximum allowable construction cost, the percent fee on the negotiated maximum allowable construction cost, and sales tax. If the department of enterprise services is unable to negotiate a satisfactory maximum allowable construction cost with the firm selected that the department of enterprise services determines to be fair, reasonable, and within the available funds, negotiations with that firm shall be formally terminated and the department of enterprise services shall negotiate with the next low bidder and continue until an agreement is reached or the process is terminated. If the maximum allowable construction cost varies more than fifteen percent from the bid estimated maximum allowable construction cost due to requested and approved changes in the scope by the state, the percent fee shall be renegotiated. All subcontract work shall be competitively bid with public bid openings. Specific contract requirements for women and minority enterprise participation shall be specified in each subcontract bid package that exceeds ten percent of the department's estimated project cost. All subcontractors who bid work over two hundred thousand dollars shall post a bid bond and the awarded subcontractor shall provide a performance and payment bond for their contract amount if required by the general contractor/construction manager. A low bidder who claims error and fails to enter into a contract is prohibited from bidding on the same project if a second or subsequent call for bids is made for the project. Bidding on subcontract work by the general contractor/construction manager or its subsidiaries is prohibited. The general contractor/construction manager may negotiate with the low-responsive bidder only in accordance with RCW 39.04.015 or, if unsuccessful in such negotiations, rebid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the project is completed for less than the agreed upon maximum allowable construction cost, any savings not otherwise negotiated as part of an incentive clause shall accrue to the state. If the project is completed for more than the agreed upon maximum allowable construction cost, excepting increases due to any contract change orders approved by the state, the additional cost shall be the responsibility of the general contractor/construction manager.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The powers and authority conferred by this section shall be construed as in addition and supplemental to powers or authority conferred by any other law, and nothing contained in this section may be construed as limiting any other powers or authority of the department of enterprise services. However, all actions taken pursuant to the powers and authority granted to the director or the department of enterprise services under this section may only be taken with the concurrence of the department of corrections.</p>

<p>A well-trained construction trades workforce is critical to the ability of the state of Washington to construct public works. Studies of the state's workforce highlight population trends that, without a concerted effort to offset them, will lead to an inadequate supply of skilled workers in the construction industry. State government regularly constructs public works. The efficient and economical construction of public works projects will be harmed if there is not an ample supply of trained construction workers. Apprenticeship training programs are particularly effective in providing training and experience to individuals seeking to enter or advance in the workforce. By providing for apprenticeship utilization on public works projects, state government can create opportunities for training and experience that will help assure that a trained workforce will be available, including returning veterans, in sufficient numbers in the future for the construction of public works. Furthermore, the state of Washington hereby establishes its intent to assist returning veterans through programs such as the &quot;helmets to hardhats&quot; program, which is administered by the center for military recruitment, assessment, and veterans employment. It is the state's intent to assist returning veterans with apprenticeship placement career opportunities, in order to expedite the transition from military service to the construction workforce.</p>
