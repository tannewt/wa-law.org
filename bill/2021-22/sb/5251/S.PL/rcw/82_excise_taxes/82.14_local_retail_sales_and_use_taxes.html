<p>The legislature finds that the several counties and cities of the state lack adequate sources of revenue to carry out essential county and municipal purposes. The legislature further finds that the most efficient and appropriate methods of deriving revenues for such purposes is to vest additional taxing powers in the governing bodies of counties and cities which they may or may not implement. The legislature intends, by enacting this chapter, to provide the means by which essential county and municipal purposes can be financially served should they choose to employ them.</p>

<li>
<p>The governing body of any county or city, while not required by legislative mandate to do so, may, by resolution or ordinance for the purposes authorized by this chapter, impose a sales and use tax in accordance with the terms of this chapter. Such tax must be collected from those persons who are taxable by the state under chapters 82.08 and 82.12 RCW, upon the occurrence of any taxable event within the county or city as the case may be. This sales and use tax does not apply to natural or manufactured gas, except for natural gas that is used as a transportation fuel as defined in RCW 82.16.310 and is taxable by the state under chapters 82.08 and 82.12 RCW. The rate of such tax imposed by a county is five-tenths of one percent of the selling price (in the case of a sales tax) or value of the article used (in the case of a use tax). The rate of such tax imposed by a city may not exceed five-tenths of one percent of the selling price (in the case of a sales tax) or value of the article used (in the case of a use tax). However, in the event a county imposes a sales and use tax under this subsection, the rate of such tax imposed under this subsection by any city therein may not exceed four hundred and twenty-five one-thousandths of one percent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the tax authorized in subsection (1) of this section, the governing body of any county or city may by resolution or ordinance impose an additional sales and use tax in accordance with the terms of this chapter. Such additional tax must be collected upon the same taxable events upon which the tax imposed under subsection (1) of this section is imposed. The rate of such additional tax imposed by a county is up to five-tenths of one percent of the selling price (in the case of a sales tax) or value of the article used (in the case of a use tax). The rate of such additional tax imposed by a city is up to five-tenths of one percent of the selling price (in the case of a sales tax) or value of the article used (in the case of a use tax). However, in the event a county imposes a sales and use tax under the authority of this subsection at a rate equal to or greater than the rate imposed under the authority of this subsection by a city within the county, the county must receive fifteen percent of the city tax. In the event that the county imposes a sales and use tax under the authority of this subsection at a rate which is less than the rate imposed under this subsection by a city within the county, the county must receive that amount of revenues from the city tax equal to fifteen percent of the rate of tax imposed by the county under the authority of this subsection. The authority to impose a tax under this subsection is intended in part to compensate local government for any losses from the phaseout of the property tax on business inventories.</p>

A public facilities district formed under RCW 35.57.010(1)(e) may not impose the tax authorized under this section at a rate that exceeds two-tenths of one percent minus the rate of the highest tax authorized by this section that is imposed by any other public facilities district within its boundaries. An anchor jurisdiction may impose the tax authorized by subsection (2)(b) of this section at a rate not to exceed two-tenths of one percent, regardless of whether any other public facilities district (including a distressed public facilities district) within its boundaries imposes the tax authorized by this section or the rate of such tax imposed by the public facilities district. If a public facilities district formed under RCW 35.57.010(1)(e) has imposed a tax under this section and issued or incurred obligations pledging that tax, so long as those obligations are outstanding no other public facilities district within its boundaries may thereafter impose a tax under this section at a rate that would reduce the rate of the tax that was pledged to the repayment of those obligations. A public facilities district that imposes a tax under this section is responsible for the payment of any costs incurred for the purpose of administering the provisions of this section, RCW 35.57.010(1)(e), and 35.57.020(1)(b), including any administrative costs associated with the imposition of the tax under this section incurred by either the department of revenue or local government, or both.</p>

<li>
<p>The governing body of any city, while not required by legislative mandate to do so, may, by resolution or ordinance for the purposes authorized by this chapter, fix and impose on every person a use tax for the privilege of using natural gas or manufactured gas in the city as a consumer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tax is imposed in an amount equal to the value of the article used by the taxpayer multiplied by the rate in effect for the tax on natural gas businesses under RCW 35.21.870 in the city in which the article is used. The &quot;value of the article used,&quot; does not include any amounts that are paid for the hire or use of a natural gas business in transporting the gas subject to tax under this subsection if those amounts are subject to tax under RCW 35.21.870.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tax imposed under this section does not apply to the use of natural or manufactured gas if the person who sold the gas to the consumer has paid a tax under RCW 35.21.870 with respect to the gas for which exemption is sought under this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a credit against the tax levied under this section in an amount equal to any tax paid by:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The person who sold the gas to the consumer when that tax is a gross receipts tax similar to that imposed pursuant to RCW 35.21.870 by another municipality or other unit of local government with respect to the gas for which a credit is sought under this subsection; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The person consuming the gas upon which a use tax similar to the tax imposed by this section was paid to another municipality or other unit of local government with respect to the gas for which a credit is sought under this subsection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use tax imposed must be paid by the consumer. The administration and collection of the tax imposed is pursuant to RCW 82.14.050.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tax authorized by this section does not apply to the use of natural gas, compressed natural gas, or liquefied natural gas, if the consumer uses the gas for transportation fuel as defined in RCW 82.16.310.</p>

<p>The legislature finds and declares that local government criminal justice systems are in need of assistance. Many counties and cities are unable to provide sufficient funding for additional police protection, mitigation of congested court systems, public safety education, and relief of overcrowded jails.</p>
<p>In order to ensure public safety, it is necessary to provide fiscal assistance to help local governments to respond immediately to these criminal justice problems, while initiating a review of the criminal justice needs of cities and counties and the resources available to address those needs.</p>
<p>To provide for a more efficient and effective response to these problems, the legislature encourages cities and counties to coordinate strategies against crime and use multijurisdictional and innovative approaches in addressing criminal justice problems.</p>

<p>The county criminal justice assistance account is created in the state treasury. Beginning in fiscal year 2000, the state treasurer must transfer into the county criminal justice assistance account from the general fund the sum of $23,200,000 divided into four equal deposits occurring on July 1, October 1, January 1, and April 1. For each fiscal year thereafter, the state treasurer must increase the total transfer by the fiscal growth factor, as defined in RCW 43.135.025, forecast for that fiscal year by the office of financial management in November of the preceding year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The moneys deposited in the county criminal justice assistance account for distribution under this section, less any moneys appropriated for purposes under subsections (4) and (5) of this section, must be distributed at such times as distributions are made under *RCW 82.44.150 and on the relative basis of each county's funding factor as determined under this subsection.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A county's funding factor is the sum of:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The population of the county, divided by 1,000, and multiplied by two-tenths;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The crime rate of the county, multiplied by three-tenths; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The annual number of criminal cases filed in the county superior court, for each 1,000 in population, multiplied by five-tenths.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under this section and RCW 82.14.320 and 82.14.330:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The population of the county or city is as last determined by the office of financial management;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The crime rate of the county or city is the annual occurrence of specified criminal offenses, as calculated in the most recent annual report on crime in Washington state as published by the Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs, for each 1,000 in population;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The annual number of criminal cases filed in the county superior court must be determined by the most recent annual report of the courts of Washington, as published by the administrative office of the courts;</p>
</li>

<p>Distributions and eligibility for distributions in the 1989-1991 biennium must be based on 1988 figures for both the crime rate as described under <a href="ii">(b)</a> of this subsection and the annual number of criminal cases that are filed as described under <a href="iii">(b)</a> of this subsection. Future distributions must be based on the most recent figures for both the crime rate as described under <a href="ii">(b)</a> of this subsection and the annual number of criminal cases that are filed as described under <a href="iii">(b)</a> of this subsection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Moneys distributed under this section must be expended exclusively for criminal justice purposes. Except after May 13, 2021, through December 31, 2023, these funds may not be used to replace or supplant existing funding. Criminal justice purposes are defined as activities that substantially assist the criminal justice system, which may include circumstances where ancillary benefit to the civil or juvenile justice system occurs, and which includes (a) domestic violence services such as those provided by domestic violence programs, community advocates, and legal advocates, as defined in RCW 70.123.020, and (b) during the 2001-2003 fiscal biennium, juvenile dispositional hearings relating to petitions for at-risk youth, truancy, and children in need of services. Existing funding for purposes of this subsection is defined as calendar year 1989 actual operating expenditures for criminal justice purposes. Calendar year 1989 actual operating expenditures for criminal justice purposes exclude the following: Expenditures for extraordinary events not likely to reoccur, changes in contract provisions for criminal justice services, beyond the control of the local jurisdiction receiving the services, and major nonrecurring capital expenditures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not more than five percent of the funds deposited to the county criminal justice assistance account may be available for appropriations for enhancements to the state patrol crime laboratory system and the continuing costs related to these enhancements. Funds appropriated from this account for such enhancements may not supplant existing funds from the state general fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the 2017-2019 fiscal biennium, the sum of $153,000, and during the 2019-2021 and 2021-2023 fiscal biennia, the sum of $510,000, may be appropriated for the Washington state patrol to provide investigative assistance and report services to assist local law enforcement agencies to prosecute criminals. It is the intent of the legislature that this policy will be continued in subsequent fiscal biennia.</p>

If a discrepancy is found, the department must adjust its determination accordingly. A sponsoring or cosponsoring local government may not receive, in any fiscal year, more revenues from taxes imposed under the authority of this section than the amount approved annually by the department. The department may not approve the receipt of more distributions of sales and use tax under this section to a sponsoring or cosponsoring local government than is authorized under subsection (7) of this section.</p>
