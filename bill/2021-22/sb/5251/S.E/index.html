</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning October 1, 2018, marketplace facilitators subject to a tax collection obligation under RCW 82.08.052 (1) or (2) must collect and remit to the department retail sales tax on all taxable retail sales made or facilitated by the marketplace facilitator, whether in its own right or as an agent of a marketplace seller, regardless of whether the marketplace seller is subject to a tax collection obligation under RCW 82.08.052 (1) or (2). Beginning January 1, 2020, the collection obligation of a marketplace facilitator under this chapter also applies to any other taxes and fees, as defined under RCW 82.02.260, that are imposed on a retail sale made or facilitated by the marketplace facilitator, whether in its own right or as an agent of a marketplace seller, regardless of whether the marketplace seller has a tax collection obligation under RCW 82.08.052 (1) or (2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to other applicable recordkeeping requirements, the department may require a marketplace facilitator to provide or make available to the department any information the department determines is reasonably necessary to enforce the provisions of this chapter and chapter 82.13 RCW. Such information may include documentation of sales made by marketplace sellers through the marketplace facilitator's marketplace . The department may prescribe by rule the form and manner for providing this information.</p>

<li>
<p>Beginning July 1, 2019, to ensure that marketplace sellers have the necessary information to timely and accurately file their excise tax returns with the department pursuant to RCW 82.32.045, a marketplace facilitator must, at a minimum, provide each of its marketplace sellers with access, through a written report or other means, to gross sales information for all Washington sales made as an agent of the marketplace seller under this section during the immediately preceding month. Marketplace facilitators must provide such access within fifteen calendar days following the end of each month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a marketplace seller does not receive the gross sales information for all Washington sales through a marketplace facilitator, as required under (a) of this subsection (4), the marketplace seller may determine its business and occupation tax liability under chapter 82.04 RCW based on a reasonable method of estimating Washington sales as may be required or approved by the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this subsection, &quot;Washington sales&quot; means any sale sourced to this state under RCW 82.32.730, regardless of whether the sale is a retail sale.</p>

<p>If a marketplace facilitator has fully complied with the requirements of subsection (4)(a) of this section, the marketplace facilitator is relieved of liability under this chapter and chapter 82.12 RCW for failure to collect the correct amount of tax to the extent that the marketplace facilitator can show to the department's satisfaction that the error was due to incorrect information given to the marketplace facilitator by the marketplace seller, unless the marketplace facilitator and marketplace seller are affiliated persons.

<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The taxable retail sale was made through the marketplace facilitator's marketplace;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Communicates to the marketplace seller the buyer's offer to purchase the product;</p>

<p>The department may by rule determine the manner in which a taxpayer may claim the liability relief provided under this subsection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in this section, a marketplace seller obligated to collect the taxes imposed under this chapter and chapter 82.12 RCW is not required to collect such taxes on all taxable retail sales through a marketplace operated by a marketplace facilitator if the marketplace seller has obtained documentation from the marketplace facilitator indicating that the marketplace facilitator is registered with the department and will collect all applicable taxes due under this chapter and chapter 82.12 RCW on all taxable retail sales made on behalf of the marketplace seller through the marketplace operated by the marketplace facilitator . The documentation required by this subsection (7) must be provided in a form and manner prescribed by or acceptable to the department. This subsection (7) does not relieve a marketplace seller from liability for uncollected taxes due under this chapter or chapter 82.12 RCW resulting from a marketplace facilitator's failure to collect the proper amount of tax due when the error was due to incorrect information given to the marketplace facilitator by the marketplace seller.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No class action may be brought against a marketplace facilitator in any court of this state on behalf of purchasers arising from or in any way related to an overpayment of sales or use tax collected by the marketplace facilitator, regardless of whether that claim is characterized as a tax refund claim. Nothing in this subsection affects a purchaser's right to seek a refund from the department as provided under chapter 82.32 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section affects the obligation of any purchaser to remit sales or use tax and any other applicable taxes and fees, as to any applicable taxable transaction in which the seller or the seller's agent does not collect and remit sales tax.</p>

<p>Except as otherwise provided in this section, every new tax preference expires on the first day of the calendar year that is subsequent to the calendar year that is ten years from the effective date of the tax preference. With respect to any new property tax exemption, the exemption does not apply to taxes levied for collection beginning in the calendar year that is subsequent to the calendar year that is ten years from the effective date of the tax preference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If a new tax preference applies to both a state tax and a corresponding local tax that the department administers, such as a state and local sales and use tax exemption, the expiration of that new tax preference under this subsection applies to both the state and local tax.</strong></p>
</li>

<p>A future amendment that expands a tax preference does not extend the tax preference beyond the period provided in this subsection unless an extension is expressly and unambiguously stated in the amendment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsection (1) of this section does not apply if legislation creating a new tax preference includes an expiration date for the new tax preference or an exemption from this section in its entirety or from the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, whether or not such exemption is codified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsection (1) of this section does not apply to any existing tax preference that is amended to clarify an ambiguity or correct a technical inconsistency. Future enacted legislation intended to make such clarifications or corrections must explicitly indicate this intent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;New tax preference&quot; means a tax preference that initially takes effect after August 1, 2013, or a tax preference in effect as of August 1, 2013, that is expanded or extended after August 1, 2013, even if the expanding or extending amendment includes any other change to the tax preference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Tax preference&quot; has the same meaning as in RCW 43.136.021 with respect to any state tax administered by the department, except does not include the Washington estate and transfer tax in chapter 83.100 RCW.</p>

The rate percent necessary to raise the amount of taxes levied for any taxing district within the county must be computed upon the assessed value of the property of the district. All taxes assessed against any property must be added together and extended on the rolls in a column headed consolidated or total tax. In extending any tax, whenever the tax amounts to a fractional part of a cent greater than one-half of a cent it must be rounded up to one cent, and whenever it amounts to one-half of a cent or less it must be dropped.

<p>Beginning with the adjustment made by March 1, 2024, as provided in subsection (8) of this section, and every second adjustment thereafter, if an income threshold in a county is not adjusted based on percentage of county median income, then the income threshold must be adjusted based on the growth of the <strong>seasonally adjusted</strong> consumer price index for all urban consumers (CPI-U) for the prior twelve month period as published by the United States bureau of labor statistics. In no case may the adjustment be greater than one percent. The adjusted thresholds must be rounded to the nearest one dollar. If the income threshold adjustment is negative, the income threshold for the prior year continues to apply.</p>
