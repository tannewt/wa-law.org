<p>There shall be a &quot;board of industrial insurance appeals,&quot; hereinafter called the &quot;board,&quot; consisting of three members appointed by the governor, with the advice and consent of the senate, as hereinafter provided. One shall be a representative of the public and a lawyer, appointed from a mutually agreed to list of not less than three active or judicial members of the Washington state bar association, submitted to the governor by the two organizations defined below, and such member shall be the chairperson of said board. The second member shall be a representative of the majority of workers engaged in employment under this title and selected from a list of not less than three names submitted to the governor by an organization, statewide in scope, which through its affiliates embraces a cross section and a majority of the organized labor of the state. The third member shall be a representative of employers under this title, and appointed from a list of at least three names submitted to the governor by a recognized statewide organization of employers, representing a majority of employers. The initial terms of office of the members of the board shall be for six, four, and two years respectively. Thereafter all terms shall be for a period of six years. Each member of the board shall be eligible for reappointment and shall hold office until his or her successor is appointed and qualified. In the event of a vacancy the governor is authorized to appoint a successor to fill the unexpired term of his or her predecessor. All appointments to the board shall be made in conformity with the foregoing plan. In the event a board member becomes incapacitated in excess of thirty days either due to his or her illness or that of an immediate family member as determined by a request for family leave or as certified by the affected member's treating physician or licensed advanced registered nurse practitioner, the governor shall appoint an acting member to serve pro tem. Such an appointment shall be made in conformity with the foregoing plan, except that the list of candidates shall be submitted to the governor not more than fifteen days after the affected organizations are notified of the incapacity and the governor shall make the appointment within fifteen days after the list is submitted. The temporary member shall serve until such time as the affected member is able to reassume his or her duties by returning from requested family leave or as determined by the treating physician or licensed advanced registered nurse practitioner or until the affected member's term expires, whichever occurs first. Whenever the workload of the board and its orderly and expeditious disposition shall necessitate, the governor may appoint two additional pro-tem members in addition to the regular members. Such appointments shall be for a definite period of time, and shall be made from lists submitted respectively by labor and industry as in the case of regular members. One pro-tem member shall be a representative of labor and one shall be a representative of industry. Members shall devote their entire time to the duties of the board and shall receive for their services a salary as fixed by the governor in accordance with the provisions of RCW 43.03.040 which shall be in addition to travel expenses in accordance with RCW 43.03.050 and 43.03.060 as now existing or hereafter amended. Headquarters for the board shall be located in Olympia. The board shall adopt a seal which shall be judicially recognized.</p>

<p>Whenever the department has made any order, decision, or award, it shall promptly serve the worker, beneficiary, employer, or other person affected thereby, with a copy thereof by mail, or if the worker, beneficiary, employer, or other person affected thereby chooses, the department may send correspondence and other legal notices by secure electronic means except for orders communicating the closure of a claim. In the event the department has made an order communicating the closure of a claim of a self-insured employer, the self-insured employer may serve the department order provided the self-insured employer does so using a separate, secure, and verifiable nonelectronic means of delivery and includes the department prescribed notice explaining the contents of the order and any protest or appeal rights. The service by the self-insured employer is a communication for the purposes of filing an appeal under RCW 51.52.060. Persons who choose to receive correspondence and other legal notices electronically shall be provided information to assist them in ensuring all electronic documents and communications are received. Correspondence and notices must be addressed to such a person at his or her last known postal or electronic address as shown by the records of the department. Correspondence and notices sent electronically are considered received on the date sent by the department. The copy, in case the same is a final order, decision, or award, shall bear on the same side of the same page on which is found the amount of the award, a statement, set in black faced type of at least ten point body or size, that such final order, decision, or award shall become final within sixty days from the date the order is communicated to the parties unless a written request for reconsideration is filed with the department of labor and industries, Olympia, or an appeal is filed with the board of industrial insurance appeals, Olympia. However, a department order or decision making demand, whether with or without penalty, for repayment of sums paid to a provider of medical, dental, vocational, or other health services rendered to an industrially injured worker, shall state that such order or decision shall become final within twenty days from the date the order or decision is communicated to the parties unless a written request for reconsideration is filed with the department of labor and industries, Olympia, or an appeal is filed with the board of industrial insurance appeals, Olympia.</p>

<p>Whenever the department has taken any action or made any decision relating to any phase of the administration of this title the worker, beneficiary, employer, or other person aggrieved thereby may request reconsideration of the department, or may appeal to the board. In an appeal before the board, the appellant shall have the burden of proceeding with the evidence to establish a prima facie case for the relief sought in such appeal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An order by the department awarding benefits shall become effective and benefits due on the date issued. Subject to (b)(i) and (ii) of this subsection, if the department order is appealed the order shall not be stayed pending a final decision on the merits unless ordered by the board. Upon issuance of the order granting the appeal, the board will provide the worker with notice concerning the potential of an overpayment of benefits paid pending the outcome of the appeal and the requirements for interest on unpaid benefits pursuant to RCW 51.52.135. A worker may request that benefits cease pending appeal at any time following the employer's motion for stay or the board's order granting appeal. The request must be submitted in writing to the employer, the board, and the department. Any employer may move for a stay of the order on appeal, in whole or in part. The motion must be filed within fifteen days of the order granting appeal. The board shall conduct an expedited review of the claim file provided by the department as it existed on the date of the department order. The board shall issue a final decision within twenty-five days of the filing of the motion for stay or the order granting appeal, whichever is later. The board's final decision may be appealed to superior court in accordance with RCW 51.52.110. The board shall grant a motion to stay if the moving party demonstrates that it is more likely than not to prevail on the facts as they existed at the time of the order on appeal. The board shall not consider the likelihood of recoupment of benefits as a basis to grant or deny a motion to stay. If a self-insured employer prevails on the merits, any benefits paid may be recouped pursuant to RCW 51.32.240.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>If upon reconsideration requested by a worker or medical provider, the department has ordered an increase in a permanent partial disability award from the amount reflected in an earlier order, the award reflected in the earlier order shall not be stayed pending a final decision on the merits. However, the increase is stayed without further action by the board pending a final decision on the merits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any party appeals an order establishing a worker's wages or the compensation rate at which a worker will be paid temporary or permanent total disability or loss of earning power benefits, the worker shall receive payment pending a final decision on the merits based on the following:</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>
<p>When the employer is self-insured, the wage calculation or compensation rate the employer most recently submitted to the department; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the employer is insured through the state fund, the highest wage amount or compensation rate uncontested by the parties.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Payment of benefits or consideration of wages at a rate that is higher than that specified in (b)(ii)(A) or (B) of this subsection is stayed without further action by the board pending a final decision on the merits.</p>
<ol type="a" start="3">
<li>In an appeal from an order of the department that alleges willful misrepresentation, the department or self-insured employer shall initially introduce all evidence in its case in chief. Any such person aggrieved by the decision and order of the board may thereafter appeal to the superior court, as prescribed in this chapter.</li>

<p>The board, upon request of the worker, beneficiary, or employer, or upon its own motion, may direct all parties interested in an appeal, together with their attorneys, if any, to appear before it, a member of the board, or an authorized industrial appeals judge, for a conference for the purpose of determining the feasibility of settlement, the simplification of issues of law and fact, the necessity of amendments to the notice of appeal or other pleadings, the possibility of obtaining admissions of fact and of documents which will avoid unnecessary proof, the limitation of the number of expert witnesses, and such other matters as may aid in the disposition of the appeal. Such conference may be held prior to the hearing, or it may be held during the hearing, at the discretion of the board member or industrial appeals judge conducting the same, in which case the hearing will be recessed for such conference. Following the conference, the board member or industrial appeals judge conducting the same, shall state on the record the results of such conference, and the parties present or their representatives shall state their concurrence on the record. Such agreement as stated on the record shall control the subsequent course of the proceedings, unless modified at a subsequent hearing to prevent manifest injustice. If agreement concerning final disposition of the appeal is reached by the parties present at the conference, or by the employer and worker or beneficiary, the board may enter a final decision and order in accordance therewith, providing the board finds such agreement is in conformity with the law and the facts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to carry out subsection (1) of this section, the board shall develop expertise to mediate disputes informally. Where possible, industrial appeals judges with a demonstrated history of successfully resolving disputes or who have received training in dispute resolution techniques shall be appointed to perform mediation functions. No industrial appeals judge who mediates in a particular appeal may, without the consent of the parties, participate in writing the proposed decision and order in the appeal: PROVIDED, That this shall not prevent an industrial appeals judge from issuing a proposed decision and order responsive to a motion for summary disposition or similar motion. This section shall not operate to prevent the board from developing additional methods and procedures to encourage resolution of disputes by agreement or otherwise making efforts to reduce adjudication time.</p>

<p>If, on appeal to the board, the order, decision, or award of the department is reversed or modified and additional relief is granted to a worker or beneficiary, or in cases where a party other than the worker or beneficiary is the appealing party and the worker's or beneficiary's right to relief is sustained by the board, the board shall fix a reasonable fee for the services of his or her attorney in proceedings before the board if written application therefor is made by the attorney, worker, or beneficiary within one year from the date the final decision and order of the board is communicated to the party making the application. In fixing the amount of such attorney's fee, the board shall take into consideration the fee allowed, if any, by the director, for services before the department, and the board may review the fee fixed by the director. Any attorney's fee set by the department or the board may be reviewed by the superior court upon application of such attorney, worker, or beneficiary. The department or self-insured employer, as the case may be, shall be served a copy of the application and shall be entitled to appear and take part in the proceedings. Where the board, pursuant to this section, fixes the attorney's fee, it shall be unlawful for an attorney to charge or receive any fee for services before the board in excess of that fee fixed by the board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For claim resolution settlement agreements, fees for attorney services are limited to fifteen percent of the total amount to be paid to the worker after the agreement becomes final. The board will also decide on any disputes as to attorneys' fees for services related to claim resolution settlement agreements consistent with the procedures in subsection (2) of this section.</p>

<li>
<p>In an appeal to the board involving the presumption established under RCW 51.32.185, the attorney's fee shall be payable as set forth under RCW 51.32.185.</p>
