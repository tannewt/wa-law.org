<h2 id="section-1-138">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-138">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that gasoline-powered and diesel-powered landscape equipment emit a host of air pollutants, including nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, carbon dioxide, and other pollutants, contributing to the global climate crisis and negatively impacting public health. According to the United States environmental protection agency, gas-powered mowers contribute five percent of United States air pollution and estimates indicate more than 17,000,000 gallons of fuel, mostly gasoline, is spilled each year while refueling lawn equipment. Nationally, the department of transportation data shows that in 2018, Americans used nearly 3,000,000,000 gallons of gasoline running lawn and garden equipment, equivalent to the annual energy use of more than 3,000,000 homes. One hour of running a gas lawnmower can contribute as much smog-forming pollution as driving a passenger car 300 miles, and one hour of running a gas leaf blower can contribute as much smog-forming pollution as driving a passenger car 1,100 miles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that the small gas engines used in lawn and garden equipment are not only bad for the environment and contributing to climate change, but they can also cause asthma, hearing loss, and other health issues for workers who use them. Going electric can generate health benefits and protect those who have to hear, handle, and inhale gas engines for hours on end. Additionally, the noise from gas-powered equipment can be a nuisance, with many communities enacting restrictions on the use of commercial lawn equipment. Residents value the quiet of electric equipment, especially during a time when many are working from home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that the technology and consumer markets are ready for the transition to cleaner, all-electric lawn and garden equipment. In some instances, electric and battery-operated equipment are just as powerful as gas, and more efficient. The market share of battery-powered lawn equipment is growing at a rate three times faster than gas, and already, many homeowners, businesses, cities, and universities have converted to all-electric landscaping equipment. It is estimated that the volume of electric-powered lawn equipment that North American manufacturers shipped jumped from about 9,000,000 units in 2015 to over 16,000,000 in 2020, an increase of more than 75 percent in only five years, and during that time, electric equipment went from roughly 32 percent to 44 percent of the overall lawn equipment market. Some manufacturers even have plans to cease the production of gas-powered equipment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to establish a zero-emission landscaping equipment incentive to accelerate the phase out of super-polluting gas-powered equipment by assisting residents and businesses in transitioning to cleaner alternatives.</p>
