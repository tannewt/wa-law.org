<h2 id="section-1-411">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-411">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that preventing catastrophic wildfires is an important and urgent duty of the state, as doing so protects the public as well as homes in the rural and urban edge communities, keeps forests intact, and maintains clean air for the benefit of all citizens. The legislature also finds that funding forest health activities and related community resiliency projects is an active means to prevent catastrophic wildfires, by reducing fuel loads that lead to such fires. Providing for active forest health treatments also maintains a working forest environment that sustains jobs, maintains healthy forests, and keeps the public that live near areas of wildfire threat aware, engaged, and educated about minimizing wildfire risk, thereby helping maintain resilient communities.</p>
<p>Previous acts of the legislature, including chapter 95, Laws of 2017 and chapter 248, Laws of 2017, have called upon the department of natural resources to create plans for solving the state's forest health issues, with specific targets for a 20-year plan and for assessing and treating 1,000,000 acres of land by 2033. The department of natural resources has created the 20-Year Forest Health Strategic Plan. The legislature intends to fund implementation of the plan with this chapter.</p>

<h2 id="section-7-117">Section 7 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7-117">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Washington forest health bond account is created in the state treasury.

Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. The account is intended to fund projects using proceeds from the sale of tax-exempt bonds.

<p>It is the intent of the legislature that the proceeds of the sale of new bonds authorized in this chapter will be appropriated in phases over eight biennia, beginning with the 2021-2023 biennium, to provide additional funding for forest health activities. This chapter is not intended to limit the legislature's ability to appropriate bond proceeds if the full amount authorized in this chapter has not been appropriated after eight biennia, and the authorization to issue bonds contained in this chapter does not expire until the full authorization has been appropriated and issued.</p>
