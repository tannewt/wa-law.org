<li>
<p>An otherwise effective written instrument of transfer may not be deemed testamentary solely because of a provision for a nonprobate transfer at death in the instrument.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Provision for a nonprobate transfer at death&quot; as used in subsection (1) of this section includes, but is not limited to, a written provision that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Money or another benefit up to that time due to, controlled, or owned by a decedent before death must be paid after the decedent's death to a person whom the decedent designates either in the instrument or a separate writing, including a will, executed at any time;</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Otherwise effective written instrument of transfer&quot; as used in subsection (1) of this section means: An insurance policy; a contract of employment; a bond; a mortgage; a promissory note; a certified or uncertified security; an account agreement; a compensation plan; a pension plan; an individual retirement plan; an employee benefit plan; a joint tenancy; a community property agreement; a trust; a conveyance; a deed of gift; a contract; or another written instrument of a similar nature that would be effective if it did not contain provision for a nonprobate transfer at death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section only eliminates a requirement that instruments of transfer comply with formalities for executing wills under chapter 11.12 RCW. This section does not make a written instrument effective as a contract, gift, conveyance, deed, or trust that would not otherwise be effective as such for reasons other than failure to comply with chapter 11.12 RCW.</p>
