<p>Unless the trust instrument designates a state other than Washington as the situs of the trust and does not expressly authorize transfer of situs, the trustee may register the trust as a Washington trust if any of the factors in subsection (1)(a) through (e) of this section are present. The trustee must register the trust by filing with the clerk of the court in any county where venue lies for the trust under RCW 11.96A.050, a statement including the following information:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The name and address of the trustee;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The date of the trust, name of the trustor, and name of the trust, if any;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The factor or factors listed in subsection (1)(a) through (e) of this section that are present for the trust and which qualify the trust for registration.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within five days of filing the registration with the court, the trustee must mail a copy of the registration to each qualified beneficiary who has not waived notice of the registration, in writing, filed in the cause, together with a notice that must be in substantially the same form as set forth in this section. Persons receiving such notice have thirty days from the date of filing the registration to file a petition in the court objecting to such registration and requesting the court to issue an order that Washington is not the proper situs of the trust, and to serve a copy of such petition upon the trustee or the trustee's lawyer. If a petition objecting to the registration is filed within thirty days of the date of filing the registration, the trustee must request the court to fix a time and place for the hearing of the petition and notify by mail, personal service or electronic transmission, if a valid consent to electronic transmission is in effect under the terms of RCW 11.96A.110, all qualified beneficiaries of the time and place of the hearing, not less than ten days before the hearing on the petition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless a person receiving notice of the registration files a petition with the court objecting to the registration within thirty days of the date of filing the registration, the registration will be deemed the equivalent of an order entered by the court declaring that the situs of the trust is Washington. After expiration of the thirty-day period following filing of the registration, the trustee may obtain a certificate of registration signed by the clerk, and issued under the seal of the court, which may be in the form specified in (d) of this subsection.</p>

<p>A trust may be created for a noncharitable purpose without a definite or definitely ascertainable beneficiary or for a noncharitable but otherwise valid purpose to be selected by the trustee. The trust may not be enforced for longer than the time period specified in RCW 11.98.130 as the period during which a trust cannot be deemed to violate the rule against perpetuities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A trust authorized by this section may be enforced by a person appointed in the terms of the trust or, if no person is so appointed, by a person appointed by the court. Such person is considered to be a permissible distributee of the trust; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Property of a trust authorized by this section may be applied only to its intended use, except to the extent the court determines that the value of the trust property exceeds the amount required for the intended use. Except as otherwise provided in the terms of the trust, property not required for the intended use must be distributed to the trustor, if then living, otherwise to the trustor's successors in interest. Successors in interest include the beneficiaries under the trustor's will, if the trustor has a will, or, in the absence of an effective will provision, the trustor's heirs.</p>

<li>
<p>Any power vested in three or more trustees jointly may be exercised by a majority of such trustees; but no trustee who has not joined in exercising a power is liable to the beneficiaries or to others for the consequences of such exercise; nor is a dissenting trustee liable for the consequences of an act in which that trustee joins at the direction of the majority of the trustees, if that trustee expressed his or her dissent in writing to each of the co-trustees at or before the time of such joinder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where two or more trustees are appointed to execute a trust and one or more of them for any reason does not accept the appointment or having accepted ceases to be a trustee, the survivor or survivors shall execute the trust and shall succeed to all the powers, duties and discretionary authority given to the trustees jointly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An individual trustee, with a co-trustee's consent, may, by a signed, written instrument, delegate any power, duty, or authority as trustee to that co-trustee. This delegation is effective upon delivery of the instrument to that co-trustee and may be revoked at any time by delivery of a similar signed, written instrument to that co-trustee. However, if a power, duty, or authority is expressly conferred upon only one trustee, it shall not be delegated to a co-trustee. If that power, duty, or authority is expressly excluded from exercise by a trustee, it shall not be delegated to the excluded trustee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If one trustee gives written notice to all other co-trustees of an action that the trustee proposes be taken, then the failure of any co-trustee to deliver a written objection to the proposal to the trustee, at the trustee's then address of record and within fifteen days from the date the co-trustee actually receives the notice, constitutes formal approval by the co-trustee, unless the co-trustee had previously given written notice that was unrevoked at the time of the trustee's notice, to that trustee that this fifteen-day notice provision is inoperative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As to any effective delegation made under subsection (3) of this section, a co-trustee has no liability for failure to participate in the administration of the trust.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Nothing in this section, however, otherwise excuses a co-trustee from liability for failure to participate in the administration of the trust and nothing in this section, including subsection (3) of this section, excuses a co-trustee from liability for the failure to attempt to prevent a breach of trust.</p>

<li>
<p>An investment by a trustee in securities of an investment company or investment trust to which the trustee, or its affiliate, provides services in a capacity other than as trustee is not presumed to be affected by a conflict between personal and fiduciary interests if the investment complies with the prudent investor rule of chapter 11.100 RCW. In addition to its compensation for acting as trustee, the trustee may be compensated by the investment company or investment trust for providing those services out of fees charged to the trust. If the trustee receives compensation from the investment company or investment trust for providing investment advisory or investment management services, the trustee must at least annually notify the permissible distributees of the rate and method by which that compensation was determined. The obligation of the trustee to provide the notice described in this section may be waived or modified by the trustor in the trust document or in a separate writing, made at any time, that is delivered to the trustee.</p>

<li>
<p>The following transactions, if fair to the beneficiaries, cannot be voided under this section:</p>

<li>
<p>An agreement between a trustee and a beneficiary relating to the appointment or compensation of the trustee;</p>

<li>
<p>Payment of reasonable compensation to the trustee and any affiliate providing services to the trust, provided total compensation is reasonable;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A transaction between a trust and another trust, decedent's estate, or guardianship of which the trustee is a fiduciary or in which a beneficiary has an interest;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A deposit of trust money in a regulated financial-service institution operated by the trustee or its affiliate;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A delegation and any transaction made pursuant to the delegation from a trustee to an agent that is affiliated or associated with the trustee; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any loan from the trustee or its affiliate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court may appoint a special fiduciary to make a decision with respect to any proposed transaction that might violate this section if entered into by the trustee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a trust has two or more beneficiaries, the trustee must act impartially in administering the trust and distributing the trust property, giving due regard to the beneficiaries' respective interests.</p>

<p>As used in this section, a trust includes a probate estate, and a trustee includes a personal representative. The words &quot;trustee&quot; and &quot;as trustee&quot; mean &quot;personal representative&quot; and &quot;as personal representative&quot; where this section is being construed in regard to personal representatives.</p>
<p>Actions on contracts which have been transferred to a trust and on contracts made by a trustee, and actions in tort for personal liability incurred by a trustee in the course of administration may be maintained by the party in whose favor the cause of action has accrued as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The plaintiff may sue the trustee in the trustee's representative capacity and any judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff is collectible by execution out of the trust property: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, If the action is in tort, collection shall not be had from the trust property unless the court determines in the action that (a) the tort was a common incident of the kind of business activity in which the trustee or the trustee's predecessor was properly engaged for the trust; or (b) that, although the tort was not a common incident of such activity, neither the trustee nor the trustee's predecessor, nor any officer or employee of the trustee or the trustee's predecessor, was guilty of personal fault in incurring the liability; or (c) that, although the tort did not fall within classes (a) or (b) above, it increased the value of the trust property. If the tort is within classes (a) or (b) above, collection may be had of the full amount of damage proved, and if the tort is within class (c) above, collection may be had only to the extent of the increase in the value of the trust property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the action is on a contract made by the trustee, the trustee may be held personally liable on the contract, if personal liability is not excluded. Either the addition by the trustee of the words &quot;trustee&quot; or &quot;as trustee&quot; after the signature of a trustee to a contract or the transaction of business as trustee under an assumed name in compliance with chapter 19.80 RCW excludes the trustee from personal liability. If the action is on a contract transferred to the trust or trustee, subject to any rights therein vested at time of the transfer, the trustee is personally liable only if he or she has in writing assumed that liability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In any such action against the trustee in the trustee's representative capacity the plaintiff need not prove that the trustee could have secured reimbursement from the trust fund if the trustee had paid the plaintiff's claim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The trustee may also be held personally liable for any tort committed by him or her, or by his or her agents or employees in the course of their employments only if, and to the extent that, damages for the tort are not collectible from trust property as provided in and pursuant to subsection (1) of this section.</p>
</li>

<p>Due to the inherent conflict of interest that exists between a trustee and a beneficiary of a trust, unless the terms of a trust refer specifically to RCW 11.98.200 through 11.98.240 and provide expressly to the contrary, the powers conferred upon a trustee who is a beneficiary of the trust, other than the trustor as a trustee, cannot be exercised by the trustee to make:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Discretionary distributions of either principal or income to or for the benefit of the trustee, except to provide for the trustee's health, education, maintenance, or support as described under section 2041 or 2514 of the Internal Revenue Code and the applicable regulations adopted under that section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discretionary allocations of receipts or expenses as between principal and income, unless the trustee acts in a fiduciary capacity whereby the trustee has no power to enlarge or shift a beneficial interest except as an incidental consequence of the discharge of the trustee's fiduciary duties; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discretionary distributions of either principal or income to satisfy a legal obligation of the trustee.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A proscribed power under this section that is conferred upon two or more trustees may be exercised by the trustees that are not disqualified under this section. If there is no trustee qualified to exercise a power proscribed under this section, a person described in RCW 11.96A.080 who is entitled to seek judicial proceedings with respect to a trust may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint another trustee who would not be disqualified, and the power may be exercised by another trustee appointed by the court. Alternatively, another trustee who would not be disqualified may be appointed in accordance with the provisions of the trust instrument if the procedures are provided, or as set forth in RCW 11.98.039 as if the office of trustee were vacant, or by a nonjudicial dispute resolution agreement under RCW 11.96A.220.</p>
