<li>
<p>For testamentary trusts established under wills probated in the state of Washington, in the superior court of the county where the probate of the will is being administered or was completed or, in the alternative, the superior court of the county where any qualified beneficiary of the trust as defined in RCW 11.98.002 resides, the county where any trustee resides or has a place of business, or the county where any real property that is an asset of the trust is located; and</p>

<li>
<p>A party to a proceeding pertaining to a trust may request that venue be changed. If the request is made within four months of the giving of the first notice of a proceeding pertaining to the trust, except for good cause shown, venue must be moved to the county with the strongest connection to the trust as determined by the court, considering such factors as the residence of a qualified beneficiary of the trust as defined in RCW 11.98.002, the residence or place of business of a trustee, and the location of any real property that is an asset of the trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Venue for proceedings subject to *chapter 11.88 or 11.92 RCW must be determined under the provisions of those chapters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Venue for proceedings pertaining to the probate of wills, the administration and disposition of a decedent's property, including nonprobate assets, and any other matter not identified in subsection (1), (2), or (3) of this section, must be in any county in the state of Washington that the petitioner selects. A party to a proceeding may request that venue be changed if the request is made within four months of the mailing of the notice of appointment and pendency of probate required by RCW 11.28.237, and except for good cause shown, venue must be moved as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If the decedent was a resident of the state of Washington at the time of death, to the county of the decedent's residence; or</p>

<li>
<p>Venue for proceedings pertaining to powers of attorney must be in the superior court of the county of the principal's residence, except for good cause shown.</p>

<li>
<p>If venue is moved, an action taken before venue is changed is not invalid because of the venue.</p>

<p>The terms of a will or trust, even if unambiguous, may be reformed by judicial proceedings under this chapter to conform the terms to the intention of the testator or trustor if it is proved by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that both the intent of the testator or trustor and the terms of the will or trust were affected by a mistake of fact or law, whether in expression or inducement. This does not limit the ability to reform the will or trust using the binding nonjudicial procedures of RCW 11.96A.220.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that it is in the interest of the citizens of the state of Washington to encourage the prompt and early resolution of disputes in trust, estate, and nonprobate matters. The legislature endorses the use of dispute resolution procedures by means other than litigation. The legislature also finds that the former chapter providing for the nonjudicial resolution of trust, estate, and nonprobate disputes, *chapter 11.96 RCW, has resulted in the successful resolution of thousands of disputes since 1984. The nonjudicial procedure has resulted in substantial savings of public funds by removing those disputes from the court system. Enhancement of the statutory framework supporting the nonjudicial process in *chapter 11.96 RCW would be beneficial and would foster even greater use of nonjudicial dispute methods to resolve trust, estate, and nonprobate disputes. The legislature further finds that it would be beneficial to allow parties to disputes involving trusts, estates, and nonprobate assets to have access to a process for required mediation followed by arbitration using mediators and arbitrators experienced in trust, estate, and nonprobate matters. Finally, the legislature also believes it would be beneficial to parties with disputes in trusts, estates, and nonprobate matters to clarify and streamline the statutory framework governing the procedures governing these cases in the court system.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature adopts RCW 11.96A.270 through 11.96A.320, that enhance *chapter 11.96 RCW and allow required mediation and arbitration in disputes involving trusts, estates, and nonprobate matters that are brought to the courts. RCW 11.96A.270 through 11.96A.320 also set forth specific civil procedures for handling trust and estate disputes in the court system. It is intended that the adoption of RCW 11.96A.270 through 11.96A.320 will encourage and direct all parties in trust, estate, and nonprobate matter disputes, and the court system, to provide for expeditious, complete, and final decisions to be made in disputed trust, estate, and nonprobate matters.</p>

<p>The intent of RCW 11.96A.260 through 11.96A.320 is to provide for the efficient settlement of disputes in trust, estate, and nonprobate matters through mediation and arbitration by providing any party the right to proceed first with mediation and then arbitration before formal judicial procedures may be utilized. Accordingly, any of the requirements or rights under RCW 11.96A.260 through 11.96A.320 are subject to any contrary agreement between the parties or the parties' virtual representatives.</p>
