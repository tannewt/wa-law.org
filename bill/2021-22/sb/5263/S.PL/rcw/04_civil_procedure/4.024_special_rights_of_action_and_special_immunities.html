<p>Operators are liable for failure to exercise ordinary and reasonable care to protect persons and property subject to injury in nuclear incidents. In addition, operators are liable for operational expenses and emergency purchases incurred by local or state governments in responding to nuclear incidents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a nuclear incident occurs, there is a presumption that the operator of a waste repository was negligent in constructing, operating, or monitoring the waste repository, or in transporting radioactive waste, and that the operator was an actual cause of the nuclear incident. The presumption may be rebutted by a clear and convincing showing by the operator that the nuclear incident was not the result of the operator's negligence and that the operator's negligence was not an actual cause of the nuclear incident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not limit the recovery of parties injured by a nuclear incident against the operators of a waste repository under theories of negligence in selecting contractors, failure to retain adequate controls over the waste repository, vicarious liability for contractors, failure to take reasonable precautionary measures with respect to inherently dangerous activities, and other negligence theories. This section does not limit the recovery of parties injured by a nuclear incident against parties other than operators of a waste facility.</p>

<p>The legislature finds and declares application of this section to pending claims and actions clarifies existing state law rather than changes it. Public employees who paid agency or fair share fees as a condition of public employment in accordance with state law and supreme court precedent before June 27, 2018, had no legitimate expectation of receiving that money under any available cause of action. Public employers and employee organizations who relied on, and abided by, state law and supreme court precedent in deducting and accepting those fees were not liable to refund them. Agency or fair share fees paid for collective bargaining representation that employee organizations were obligated by state law to provide to public employees. Application of this section to pending claims will preserve, rather than interfere with, important reliance interests.</p>

<p>Information provided by citizens concerning potential wrongdoing is vital to effective law enforcement and the efficient operation of government.

The costs of defending against such suits can be severely burdensome. The purpose of RCW 4.24.500 through 4.24.520 is to protect individuals who make good-faith reports to appropriate governmental bodies.</p>

The agency may disclose, upon request, relevant, necessary, and accurate information to any victim or witness to the offense, any individual community member who lives near the residence where the offender resides, expects to reside, or is regularly found, and any individual who requests information regarding a specific offender; (b) for offenders classified as risk level II, the agency may also disclose relevant, necessary, and accurate information to public and private schools, child day care centers, family day care providers, public libraries, businesses and organizations that serve primarily children, women, or vulnerable adults, and neighbors and community groups near the residence where the offender resides, expects to reside, or is regularly found; (c) for offenders classified as risk level III, the agency may also disclose relevant, necessary, and accurate information to the public at large; and (d) because more localized notification is not feasible and homeless and transient offenders may present unique risks to the community, the agency may also disclose relevant, necessary, and accurate information to the public at large for offenders registered as homeless or transient.</p>

The warning notice must consist of a sign in black letters, with each letter to be a minimum of one inch in height.

<p>&quot;WARNING</p>
<p>Under Washington state law, there is limited liability for an injury to or death of a participant in an agritourism activity conducted at this agritourism location if such an injury or death results exclusively from the inherent risks of the agritourism activity. Inherent risks of agritourism activities include, among others, risks of injury inherent to land, equipment, and animals, as well as the potential for you to act in a negligent manner that may contribute to your injury or death. We are required to ensure that in any activity involving minor children, only age-appropriate access to activities, equipment, and animals is permitted. You are assuming the risk of participating in this agritourism activity.&quot;</p>

<li>
<p>In any civil judicial or administrative action relating to sexual harassment or sexual assault, a nondisclosure policy or agreement that purports to limit the ability of any person to produce evidence regarding past instances of sexual harassment or sexual assault by a party to the civil action does not affect discovery or the availability of witness testimony relating to that civil action. Any provision of a nondisclosure policy or agreement including any arbitration agreement or decision that would limit, prevent, or punish such disclosure is contrary to public policy and unenforceable. However, the court or presiding officer shall enter appropriate orders upon motion of any party supported by affidavit or sworn declaration, or without motion but on the court's or presiding officer's own accord, to ensure that the identity of any person who is or is alleged to be a victim of sexual harassment or sexual assault is not made public as a result of a disclosure made under this section, unless such person consents.</p>

<p>The provisions of this section do not alter admissibility standards of evidence for the court or presiding officer to decide whether the probative value of evidence offered outweighs the potential prejudice.</p>
