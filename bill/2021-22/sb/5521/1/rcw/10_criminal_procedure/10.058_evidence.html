<p>In criminal and juvenile offense proceedings where independent proof of the corpus delicti is absent, and the alleged victim of the crime is dead or incompetent to testify, a lawfully obtained and otherwise admissible confession, admission, or other statement of the defendant shall be admissible into evidence if there is substantial independent evidence that would tend to establish the trustworthiness of the confession, admission, or other statement of the defendant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining whether there is substantial independent evidence that the confession, admission, or other statement of the defendant is trustworthy, the court shall consider, but is not limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Whether there is any evidence corroborating or contradicting the facts set out in the statement, including the elements of the offense;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The character of the witness reporting the statement and the number of witnesses to the statement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether a record of the statement was made and the timing of the making of the record in relation to the making of the statement; and/or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The relationship between the witness and the defendant.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>Where the court finds that the confession, admission, or other statement of the defendant is sufficiently trustworthy to be admitted, the court shall issue a written order setting forth the rationale for admission.</p>

<p>Nothing in this section may be construed to prevent the defendant from arguing to the jury or judge in a bench trial that the statement is not trustworthy or that the evidence is otherwise insufficient to convict.</p>

<p>A law enforcement officer, prosecuting attorney, or other government official may not ask or require a victim of an alleged sex offense to submit to a polygraph examination or other truth telling device as a condition for proceeding with the investigation of the offense. The refusal of a victim to submit to a polygraph examination or other truth telling device shall not by itself prevent the investigation, charging, or prosecution of the offense.

<p>In a criminal action in which the defendant is accused of a sex offense, evidence of the defendant's commission of another sex offense or sex offenses is admissible, notwithstanding Evidence Rule 404(b), if the evidence is not inadmissible pursuant to Evidence Rule 403.</p>

<li>
<p>In a case in which the state intends to offer evidence under this rule, the attorney for the state shall disclose the evidence to the defendant, including statements of witnesses or a summary of the substance of any testimony that is expected to be offered, at least fifteen days before the scheduled date of trial or at such later time as the court may allow for good cause.</p>

<li>
<p>Any violation under RCW 9A.44.096 (sexual misconduct with a minor in the second degree); and</p>

<p>For purposes of this section, uncharged conduct is included in the definition of &quot;sex offense.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When evaluating whether evidence of the defendant's commission of another sexual offense or offenses should be excluded pursuant to Evidence Rule 403, the trial judge shall consider the following factors:</p>

<p>The similarity of the prior acts to the acts charged;</p>

<li>
<p>The court shall not exclude evidence that is otherwise admissible in a criminal proceeding on the basis that the evidence was obtained as a result of an unconstitutional search or seizure if the court determines that the search or seizure was carried out under circumstances in which the peace officer acted with an objectively reasonable good faith belief that his or her conduct was lawful and constitutionally permissible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Circumstances in which a peace officer acted with an objectively reasonable good faith belief that his or her conduct was lawful and constitutionally permissible include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Obtaining evidence pursuant to a search warrant or an arrest warrant obtained from a neutral and detached magistrate that the peace officer reasonably believes to be valid;</p>

<li>
<p>Obtaining evidence pursuant to a warrantless search incident to an arrest for violation of a statute or ordinance that is later declared unconstitutional or otherwise invalidated; and</p>

<li>
<p>Obtaining evidence in reliance upon a court precedent that is later overruled.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A showing that a peace officer obtained evidence pursuant to, and within the scope of, a search warrant constitutes prima facie evidence that the peace officer acted with an objectively reasonable good faith belief that his or her conduct was lawful and constitutionally permissible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A court shall not exclude evidence that is otherwise admissible in a criminal proceeding on the basis that the evidence was obtained in violation of a statute, ordinance, or rule unless the court finds one or more of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The statute, ordinance, or rule expressly authorizes exclusion of evidence as a sanction for its violation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The violation was deliberate and without justification;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a substantial likelihood that the reliability of the evidence has been materially affected by the violation; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The exclusion of the evidence is required under the Constitution of the United States or this state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A statute, ordinance, or rule shall not be construed to require or authorize exclusion of evidence in a criminal proceeding under circumstances in which the evidence would be admissible in federal court.</p>

<p>This section does not require or authorize the exclusion of evidence in any criminal proceeding.</p>
