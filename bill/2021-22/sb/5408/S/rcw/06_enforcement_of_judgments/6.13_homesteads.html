<p>The homestead consists of real or personal property that the owner <strong>or a dependent of the owner</strong> uses as a residence. In the case of a dwelling house or mobile home, the homestead consists of the dwelling house or the mobile home in which the owner resides or intends to reside, with appurtenant buildings, and the land on which the same are situated and by which the same are surrounded, or improved or unimproved land**, regardless of area,** owned with the intention of placing a house or mobile home thereon and residing thereon. A mobile home may be exempted under this chapter whether or not it is permanently affixed to the underlying land and whether or not the mobile home is placed upon a lot owned by the mobile home owner <strong>or a dependent of the owner</strong>. Property included in the homestead must be actually intended or used as the principal home for the owner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As used in this chapter**:**</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&quot;Forced sale&quot; includes any sale of homestead property in a bankruptcy proceeding under Title 11 of the United States Code. The reinvestment provisions of RCW 6.13.070 do not apply to the proceeds.</strong></p>

<p>If the owner is married or in a state registered domestic partnership, the homestead may consist of the community or jointly owned property of the spouses or the domestic partners or the separate property of either spouse or either domestic partner: PROVIDED, That the same premises may not be claimed separately by the spouses or domestic partners with the effect of increasing the net value of the homestead available to the marital community or state registered domestic partnership beyond the amount specified in RCW 6.13.030 as now or hereafter amended.

<p><strong>In the context of a bankruptcy case, the homestead exemption defined in this chapter is intended to apply to Washington residents to the extent that they move or purchase a replacement homestead in a different state. This section specifically allows the former Washington domiciliary to choose Washington exemptions when they relocate to another state. It does not prohibit an extraterritorial application and applies to property located in other states in the context of a claim of exemptions under the United States bankruptcy code.</strong></p>
