<p>The legislature finds that the homestead exemption is intended to protect the homeowner's equity in a home against unsecured creditors. The legislature finds that changes to the homestead exemption are necessary to modernize the law and to address the case of Wilson v. Rigby, 909 F.3d 306 (2018), to adopt the reasoning in In re Good, 588 B.R. 573 (Bankr. W.D. Wash. 2018), and to overturn In re Bankr. Petition of Wieber, 182 Wn.2d 919 (2015).</p>

A mobile home may be exempted under this chapter whether or not it is permanently affixed to the underlying land and whether or not the mobile home is placed upon a lot owned by the mobile home owner <strong>or a dependent of the owner</strong>. Property included in the homestead must be actually intended or used as the principal home for the owner.</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>Except as provided in RCW 6.13.080, the homestead is exempt from attachment and from execution or forced sale for the debts of the owner up to the amount specified in RCW 6.13.030.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In a bankruptcy case, the debtor's exemption shall be determined on the date of the bankruptcy petition. If the value of the debtor's interest in homestead property on the petition date is less than or equal to the amount that can be exempted under RCW 6.13.030, then the debtor's entire interest in the property, including the debtor's right to possession and interests of no monetary value, is exempt. Any appreciation in the value of the debtor's exempt interest in the property during the bankruptcy case is also exempt.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proceeds of the voluntary sale of the homestead in good faith for the purpose of acquiring a new homestead, and proceeds from insurance covering destruction of homestead property held for use in restoring or replacing the homestead property, up to the amount specified in RCW 6.13.030, shall likewise be exempt for one year from receipt, and also such new homestead acquired with such proceeds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every homestead created under this chapter is presumed to be valid to the extent of all the property claimed exempt, until the validity thereof is contested in a court of general jurisdiction in the county or district in which the homestead is situated.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A judgment against the owner of a homestead shall become a lien on the value of the homestead property in excess of the homestead exemption from the time the judgment creditor records the judgment with the recording officer of the county where the property is located. However, if a judgment of a district court of this state has been transferred to a superior court, the judgment becomes a lien from the time of recording with such recording officer a duly certified abstract of the record of such judgment as it appears in the office of the clerk in which the transfer was originally filed. A department of revenue tax warrant filed pursuant to RCW 82.32.210 shall become a lien on the value of the homestead property in excess of the homestead exemption from the time of filing in superior court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In the context of a bankruptcy case, the homestead exemption defined in this chapter is intended to apply to Washington residents to the extent that they move or purchase a replacement homestead in a different state. This section specifically allows the former Washington domiciliary to choose Washington exemptions when they relocate to another state. It does not prohibit an extraterritorial application and applies to property located in other states in the context of a claim of exemptions under the United States bankruptcy code.</strong></p>
