<p>The legislature recognizes the importance of spending one's final moments around those closest to him or her. As such, the legislature intends to clarify the criteria for which the secretary of the Washington state department of corrections may grant a conditional emergency medical placement to explicitly include offenders diagnosed with a terminal illness, specifically blood cancer and cancer impacting internal organs. The legislature recognizes that as innovation in cancer treatment progresses, certain cancers, such as nonmelanoma skin cancer, are not terminal and should not be considered terminal by the secretary. The legislature intends to clarify eligibility for emergency medical placement with the goal of permitting offenders with terminal illnesses the ability to pass away surrounded by those who love them.</p>
