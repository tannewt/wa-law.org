<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that minimum recycled content requirements for plastic beverage containers, bans on problematic and unnecessary plastic packaging, and standards for customer opt-in for food service packaging and accessories are among actions needed to improve the state's recycling system as well as reduce litter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By implementing a minimum recycled content requirement for plastic beverage containers, prohibiting the sale and distribution of certain expanded polystyrene products, and establishing optional serviceware requirements as provided for in this chapter, the legislature intends to take another step towards ensuring plastic packaging and other packaging materials are reduced, recycled, and reused.</p>
