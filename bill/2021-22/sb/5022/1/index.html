<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds the department of ecology was directed, through an independent consultant, to study how plastic packaging is managed in the state, assess various policy options, and provide recommendations to achieve goals, that included:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Plastic packaging sold into the state is 100 percent recyclable, reusable, or compostable by January 1, 2025.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plastic packaging sold into the state incorporates at least 20 percent postconsumer recycled content by January 1, 2025.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plastic packaging is reduced when possible and optimized to meet the need for it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that the study recommendations included establishing an extended producer responsibility policy for all consumer packaging and paper with a framework that makes producers responsible for achieving specific management and environmental outcomes for the consumer packaging they supply into Washington state. In addition, the legislature finds extended producer responsibility policies designed to cover all material types collected through the state's existing recycling system offers the potential for greater economies of scale and operational efficiencies than could be achieved under a policy applied only to a subset of materials collected through that system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends that the policy of the state is to ensure that by 2040 an overall recycling and reuse rate of 90 percent is achieved for plastic packaging and other packaging materials. The legislature further intends that these materials are recycled or reused through extended producer responsibility programs. It is the intent of the legislature that extended producer responsibility programs are implemented by and for producers of plastic packaging and other material types so that the design and management of their packaging is accomplished in a manner that ensures minimal environmental impact, involves producers from design concept to end-of-life management, and incentivizes innovation and research to minimize environmental impacts.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of state government to ensure that local governments are providing adequate source reduction and separation opportunities and incentives to all, including persons in both rural and urban areas, and nonresidential waste generators such as commercial, industrial, and institutional entities, recognizing the need to provide flexibility to accommodate differing population densities, distances to and availability of recycling markets, and collection and disposal costs in each community; and to provide county and city governments with adequate technical resources to accomplish this responsibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It is the responsibility of producers to provide for the responsible management of covered products.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Environmental and economic considerations in solving the state's solid waste management problems requires strong consideration by local governments of regional solutions and intergovernmental cooperation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following priorities for the collection, handling, and management of solid waste are necessary and should be followed in descending order as applicable:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Waste reduction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recycling, with source separation of recyclable materials as the preferred method;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Energy recovery, incineration, or landfill of separated waste;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Energy recovery, incineration, or landfill of mixed municipal solid wastes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the state's goal to achieve a fifty percent recycling rate by 2007.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the state's goal that programs be established to eliminate residential or commercial yard debris in landfills by 2012 in those areas where alternatives to disposal are readily available and effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Steps should be taken to make recycling at least as affordable and convenient to the ratepayer as mixed waste disposal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is necessary to compile and maintain adequate data on the types and quantities of solid waste that are being generated and to monitor how the various types of solid waste are being managed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vehicle batteries should be recycled and the disposal of vehicle batteries into landfills or incinerators should be discontinued.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excessive and nonrecyclable packaging of products should be avoided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comprehensive education should be conducted throughout the state so that people are informed of the need to reduce, source separate, and recycle solid waste.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All governmental entities in the state should set an example by implementing aggressive waste reduction and recycling programs at their workplaces and by purchasing products that are made from recycled materials and are recyclable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To ensure the safe and efficient operations of solid waste disposal facilities, it is necessary for operators and regulators of landfills and incinerators to receive training and certification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is necessary to provide adequate funding to all levels of government so that successful waste reduction and recycling programs can be implemented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The development of stable and expanding markets for recyclable materials is critical to the long-term success of the state's recycling goals. Market development must be encouraged on a state, regional, and national basis to maximize its effectiveness. The state shall assume primary responsibility for the development of a multifaceted market development program to carry out the purposes of chapter 431, Laws of 1989.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is an imperative need to anticipate, plan for, and accomplish effective storage, control, recovery, and recycling of discarded tires and other problem wastes with the subsequent conservation of resources and energy.</p>

<p>The purpose of this chapter is to establish a comprehensive statewide program for solid waste handling, and solid waste recovery and/or recycling which will prevent land, air, and water pollution and conserve the natural, economic, and energy resources of this state. To this end it is the purpose of this chapter:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To assign primary responsibility for adequate solid waste handling to local government, reserving to the state, however, those functions necessary to assure effective programs throughout the state**, and reserving to producers responsibility for the management of covered products**;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide for adequate planning for solid waste handling by local government;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide for the adoption and enforcement of basic minimum performance standards for solid waste handling, including that all sites where recyclable materials are generated and transported from shall provide a separate container for solid waste;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To encourage the development and operation of waste recycling facilities needed to accomplish the management priority of waste recycling, to promote consistency in the requirements for such facilities throughout the state, and to ensure that recyclable materials diverted from the waste stream for recycling are routed to facilities in which recycling occurs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide technical and financial assistance to local governments in the planning, development, and conduct of solid waste handling programs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To encourage storage, proper disposal, and recycling of discarded vehicle tires and to stimulate private recycling programs throughout the state; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To encourage the development and operation of waste recycling facilities and activities needed to accomplish the management priority of waste recycling and to promote consistency in the permitting requirements for such facilities and activities throughout the state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that local governments be encouraged to use the expertise of private industry and to contract with private industry to the fullest extent possible to carry out solid waste recovery and/or recycling programs.</p>
