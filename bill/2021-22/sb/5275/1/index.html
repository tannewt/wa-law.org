<p>Affordable housing in rural areas for essential public employees such as teachers, nurses, and other public servants is in high demand. Rural counties in Washington are struggling to meet these demands as well as comply with the restrictions of the rural element of the growth management act. This inability to increase development has led to a housing shortage even in rural areas.</p>
<p>Limited areas of more intense rural development were instituted at the first passage of the growth management act in the 1990's. These areas are confined by a boundary set almost 30 years ago. Rural counties have struggled to develop under the growth management act. It is almost impossible for these counties to react to development pressures and societal pressures for housing and jobs under these conditions. The legislature finds that reform is necessary. Additionally, the legislature finds that providing flexibility with regard to the uses allowed within the boundary may alleviate some of these struggles. The legislature finds that it is important for rural counties to adopt creative solutions to the conflicts caused by development pressures.</p>
