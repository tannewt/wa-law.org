(2) The task force provided recommendations to state agencies for measurable goals and model policies to reduce environmental health inequities in Washington, equitable practices for meaningful community involvement, and how to use the environmental health disparities map to identify overburdened communities. In order for all communities in Washington state to be healthy and thriving, state government must concentrate on communities that currently do not meet environmental health standards.

"Vulnerable populations" include minority, low-income, tribal, or indigenous populations or geographic locations in Washington state that potentially experience disproportionate environmental harms and risks.
