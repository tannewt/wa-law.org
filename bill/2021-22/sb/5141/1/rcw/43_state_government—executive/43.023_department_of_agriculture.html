<p>Subject to the availability of funds appropriated for this specific purpose, and in consultation with the department of fish and wildlife, the department must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Review, in consultation with Washington State University, education needs related to pollinator education and develop a plan that outlines the goals related to pollinator education and the necessary partners, personnel, and other resources;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluate and complete an analysis of critical impacts and needed best management practices for managed and wild pollinators. The department shall lead this effort in partnership with Washington State University, and in collaboration with the department of fish and wildlife and the state conservation commission. The effort must utilize the framework established in the state's managed pollinator protection plan as a guide for formal recommendations and education opportunities. The analysis must address food insecurities, habitat loss, virus and disease, pests, and pesticides, which may play a role in pollinator health decline. The department shall make the resources produced pursuant to this subsection available to the public on the department's website, as well as through Washington State University and the state's conservation districts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Document, in consultation with Washington State University, the bee species within the state and map their distributions as practicable;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide economic and environmental impacts of weed listing and categorization on pollinator health to county noxious weed control boards in consultation with the state noxious weed control board and annually submit a report to the noxious weed control board describing pollinator health issues;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide materials, where practicable and in consultation with Washington State University, about certification programs that support pollinator health, biodiversity, and low-impact pesticide application to the public;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Educate the public through plant nurseries about the necessity for blooming nectar plants to be available to wild and managed pollinators throughout their respective active seasons;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Survey registered beekeepers to determine whether the current apiary program should be expanded to include apiary inspections or registration of apiary yards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continue and maintain partnership with federal agencies and neighboring states to promote and enhance the implementation of the national strategy to promote the health of honey bees and improve pollinator health;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase the availability of pollinator-related resources on the department's website, as practicable, and other state agencies' websites as appropriate;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review guidelines on state-managed lands to protect native pollinators and improve transparency for state-managed land areas which may permit managed honey bees so that impacts to wild pollinators from honey bees may be minimized; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In consultation with the department of revenue, review the open space taxation act and provide recommendations to the legislature, in compliance with RCW 43.01.036, on options to include pollinator habitat in the current open space property tax classification.</p>
