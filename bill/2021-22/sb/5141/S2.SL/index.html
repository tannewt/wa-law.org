<ol>
<li>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to reduce environmental and health disparities in Washington state and improve the health of all Washington state residents. This chapter implements the recommendations of the environmental justice task force established in section 221(48), chapter 415, Laws of 2019 entitled &quot;Report to the Washington state governor and legislature, Environmental Justice Task Force: Recommendations for Prioritizing EJ in Washington State Government (October 2020).&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As conveyed in the task force report, Washington state studies and national studies found that people of color and low-income people continue to be disproportionately exposed to environmental harms in their communities. As a result, there is a higher risk of adverse health outcomes for those communities. This risk is amplified when overlaid on communities with preexisting social and economic barriers and environmental risks, and creates cumulative environmental health impacts, which this act seeks to prevent and mitigate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This chapter also seeks to reduce exposure to environmental hazards within Indian country, as defined in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1151, due to off-reservation activities within the state, and to improve state practices to reduce contamination of traditional foods wherever they occur. Exposure to such hazards can result in generational health and ecological problems, particularly on small reservations where it is impossible to move away from a hazard.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Accordingly, the state has a compelling interest in preventing and addressing such environmental health disparities in the administration of ongoing and new environmental programs, including allocation of funds, and in administering these programs so as to remedy the effects of past disparate treatment of overburdened communities and vulnerable populations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The task force provided recommendations to state agencies for measurable goals and model policies to reduce environmental health inequities in Washington, equitable practices for meaningful community involvement, and how to use the environmental health disparities map to identify and promote the equitable distribution of environmental benefits to overburdened communities. In order for all communities in Washington state to be healthy and thriving, state government should aim to concentrate government actions to benefit communities that currently have the greatest environmental and health burdens.</p>

By July 1, 2025, each covered agency must consider their agency's activities and identify and begin applying environmental justice assessments to any actions that the agency identifies as significant that are in addition to the significant agency actions identified in section 2(12) (a) through (d) of this act. Significant agency actions designated by a covered agency under this subsection must be actions that may cause environmental harm or may affect the equitable distribution of environmental benefits to an overburdened community or a vulnerable population.</p>

Through the incorporation of environmental justice principles into its decision processes, including by conducting environmental justice assessments where required under section 14 of this act, each covered agency, to the extent allowed by law and consistent with legislative appropriations, must equitably distribute funding and expenditures related to programs that address or may cause environmental harms or provide environmental benefits towards overburdened communities and vulnerable populations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning on or before July 1, 2023, each covered agency must, where practicable, take the following actions when making expenditure decisions or developing budget requests to the office of financial management and the legislature for programs that address or may cause environmental harms or provide environmental benefits:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Focus applicable expenditures on creating environmental benefits that are experienced by overburdened communities and vulnerable populations, including reducing or eliminating environmental harms, creating community and population resilience, and improving the quality of life of overburdened communities and vulnerable populations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create opportunities for overburdened communities and vulnerable populations to meaningfully participate in agency expenditure decisions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clearly articulate environmental justice goals and performance metrics to communicate the basis for agency expenditures;</p>

<li>
<p>A covered agency may adopt rules or guidelines for criteria and procedures applicable to incorporating environmental justice principles in expenditure decisions, granting or withholding benefits, and processes for budget development.</p>
</li>

<p>In incorporating environmental justice principles into its decision processes for budget development, making expenditures, and granting or withholding benefits, each covered agency must consider any guidance developed by the council pursuant to section 20 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A covered agency may not take actions or make expenditures under this section that are inconsistent with or conflict with other statutes or with conditions or limitations on the agency's appropriations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a covered agency, due to the breadth of its programs and funding opportunities, determines it is not practicable to take the actions listed in subsection (2) of this section for all applicable expenditure decisions and budget requests developed, the covered agency is encouraged to prioritize taking the actions listed in subsection (2) of this section for those budget requests and expenditure decisions that are primarily directed at addressing environmental impacts. By July 1, 2023, each covered agency must publish on its website the types of decision processes for budget development, making expenditures, and granting or withholding environmental benefits for which the agency will take the actions listed in subsection (2) of this section.</p>
