<li>
<p>&quot;Computation date&quot; means July 1st of any year;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Cut-off date&quot; means September 30th next following the computation date;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Payroll&quot; means all wages (as defined for contribution purposes) paid by an employer to individuals in his or her employment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Qualification date&quot; means April 1st of the second year preceding the computation date;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Qualified employer&quot; means any employer who (a) reported some employment in the twelve-month period beginning with the qualification date, (b) had no period of four or more consecutive calendar quarters for which he or she reported no employment in the two calendar years immediately preceding the computation date, and (c) has submitted by the cut-off date all reports, contributions, interest, and penalties required under this title for the period preceding the computation date. Unpaid contributions, interest, and penalties must be disregarded for the purposes of this section if they constitute less than either one hundred dollars or one-half of one percent of the employer's total tax reported for the twelve-month period immediately preceding the computation date. Late reports, contributions, penalties, or interest may be disregarded for the purposes of this section if showing is made to the satisfaction of the commissioner, as the commissioner may define by rule, that an otherwise qualified employer acted in good faith and that forfeiture of qualification for a reduced contribution rate because of such delinquency would be inequitable;</p>

<p>(B) Any experience assigned to the predecessor involved in the transfer. If only a portion of the business was transferred, then the experience attributable to the acquired portion is assigned to the successor.</p>

    i.

<p>Except as provided in (b)(ii) and (iii) of this subsection (2), the successor shall pay contributions:</p>
<p>(A) At the contribution rate assigned to the predecessor employer at the time of the transfer for the remainder of that rate year. Any experience attributable to the predecessor relating to the assignment of the predecessor's rate class is transferred to the successor.</p>
<p>(B) Beginning January 1st following the transfer, the successor's contribution rate for each rate year shall be based on an array calculation factor rate that is a combination of the following: The successor's experience with payrolls and benefits; and any experience assigned to the predecessor involved in the transfer. If only a portion of the business was transferred, then the experience attributable to the acquired portion is assigned to the successor if qualified under RCW 50.29.010 by including the transferred experience. If not qualified under RCW 50.29.010, the contribution rate shall equal the sum of the rates determined by the commissioner under RCW 50.29.025 (1)(d) and 50.29.041, if applicable, and continuing until the successor qualifies for a different rate, including the transferred experience.</p>
<pre><code>    ii. If there is a substantial continuity of ownership, control, or management by the successor of the business of the predecessor, the successor shall pay contributions at the contribution rate determined for the predecessor employer at the time of the transfer for the remainder of that rate year. Any experience attributable to the predecessor relating to the assignment of the predecessor's rate class is transferred to the successor. Beginning January 1st following the transfer, the successor's array calculation factor rate shall be based on a combination of the transferred experience of the acquired business and the successor's experience after the transfer.

    iii. If the successor simultaneously acquires the business or a portion of the business of two or more employers with different contribution rates, the successor's rate, from the date the transfer occurred until the end of that rate year and until it qualifies in its own right for a new rate, shall be the sum of the rates determined by the commissioner under RCW 50.29.025 (1) (a) and (b)  and 50.29.041, applicable at the time of the acquisition, to the predecessor employer who, among the parties to the acquisition, had the largest total payroll in the completed calendar quarter immediately preceding the date of transfer, but not less than the sum of the rates determined by the commissioner under RCW 50.29.025 (1)(d) and 50.29.041, if applicable.

c. With respect to predecessor employers:

    i. The contribution rate on any payroll retained by a predecessor employer shall remain unchanged for the remainder of the rate year in which the transfer occurs.

    ii. In all cases, beginning January 1st following the transfer, the predecessor's contribution rate or the predecessor's array calculation factor for each rate year shall be based on its experience with payrolls and benefits as of the regular computation date for that rate year excluding the experience of the transferred business or transferred portion of business as that experience has transferred to the successor: PROVIDED, That if all of the predecessor's business is transferred to a successor or successors, the predecessor shall not be a qualified employer until it satisfies the requirements of a &quot;qualified employer&quot; as set forth in RCW 50.29.010.

<p>A predecessor-successor relationship does not exist for purposes of subsection (2) of this section when a significant purpose of the transfer of a business or its operating assets is for the employer to move or expand an existing business, or for an employer to establish a substantially similar business under common ownership, management, and control. However, if an employer transfers its business to another employer, and both employers are at the time of transfer under substantially common ownership, management, or control, then the unemployment experience attributable to the transferred business shall also be transferred to, and combined with the unemployment experience attributable to, the employer to whom such business is so transferred as specified in subsection (2)(a) of this section.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The commissioner shall, for the rate year in which the commissioner makes the determination under this subsection and for each of the three consecutive rate years following that rate year, assign to the employer or business the total rate, which is the sum of the recalculated array calculation factor rate and a civil penalty assessment rate, calculated as follows:</p>

<p>Calculate a civil penalty assessment rate in an amount that, when added to the array calculation factor rate determined under (a)(i) of this subsection for the applicable rate year, results in a total rate equal to the maximum array calculation factor rate under RCW 50.29.025 plus two percent, which total rate is not limited by any maximum array calculation factor rate established in RCW 50.29.025 (1)(b)(ii) ;</p>

<p>If the person knowingly evading the successorship provisions, or knowingly attempting to evade these provisions, or knowingly promoting the evasion of these provisions, is not an employer, the person is subject to a civil penalty assessment of five thousand dollars per occurrence.
