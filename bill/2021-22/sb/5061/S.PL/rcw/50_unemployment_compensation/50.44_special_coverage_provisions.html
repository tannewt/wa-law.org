<p>All services performed for any political subdivision or instrumentality of one or more political subdivisions of this state or one or more political subdivisions of this state and any other state after December 31, 1977, will be deemed to be services in employment to the extent coverage is not exempted under RCW 50.44.040.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All such units of government shall file, before December 15, 1977, a written registration with the commissioner of the employment security department. Such registration shall specify the manner in which the unit of government will finance the payment of benefits. The elections available to counties, cities and towns are the local government tax, provided for in RCW 50.44.035, or payment in lieu of contributions, as described in RCW 50.44.060. The elections available to other units of government are the contributions plan in chapters 50.24 and 50.29 RCW, or payments in lieu of contributions, described in RCW 50.44.060. Under any election the governmental unit will be charged the full amount of regular, additional, and extended benefits attributable to its account.</p>

<li>
<p>A unit of government may switch from its current method of financing the payment of benefits by electing any other method which it would be authorized to select pursuant to the terms of subsection (2) of this section. Notification of such election must be filed with the commissioner no less than thirty days prior to the taxable year for which the new method of financing the payment of benefits is to be effective. An election under this section shall remain in effect for no less than two taxable years.</p>

<li>
<p>Any county, city, or town not electing to make payments in lieu of contributions shall pay a &quot;local government tax.&quot; Taxes paid under this section shall be paid into an administratively identifiable account in the unemployment compensation fund. This account shall be self-sustaining. For calendar years 1978 and 1979 all such employers shall pay local government tax at the rate of one and one-quarter percent of all remuneration paid by the governmental unit for services in its employment. For each year after 1979 each such employer's rate of tax shall be determined in accordance with this section: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That whenever it appears to the commissioner that the anticipated benefit payments from the account would jeopardize reasonable reserves in this identifiable account the commissioner may at the commencement of any calendar quarter, impose an emergency excess tax of not more than one percent of remuneration paid by the participating governmental units which &quot;excess tax&quot; shall be paid in addition to the applicable rate computed pursuant to this section until the calendar year following the next September 1st.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A reserve account shall be established for each such employer.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The &quot;reserve account&quot; of each such employer shall be credited with tax amounts paid and shall be charged with benefit amounts charged in accordance with the formula set forth in RCW 50.44.060 as now or hereafter amended except that such employer's account shall be charged for the full amount of extended benefits so attributable for weeks of unemployment commencing after January 1, 1979. Such credits and charges shall be cumulative from January 1, 1978.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the cut-off date, the &quot;reserve ratio&quot; of each such employer shall be computed by dividing its reserve account balance as of the computation date by the total remuneration paid during the preceding calendar year for services in its employment. This division shall be carried to four decimal places, with the remaining fraction, if any, disregarded.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A &quot;benefit cost ratio&quot; for each such employer shall be computed by dividing its total benefit charges during the thirty-six months ending on June 30th by its total remuneration during the three preceding calendar years: PROVIDED, That after August 31st in 1979 each employer's total benefit charges for the twelve months ending on June 30th shall be divided by its total remuneration paid in the last three quarters of calendar year 1978; and after August 31st in 1980 each employer's total benefit charges for the twenty-four months ending June 30th shall be divided by its total remuneration paid in the last three calendar quarters of 1978 and the four calendar quarters of 1979. Such computations shall be carried to four decimal places, with the remaining fraction, if any, disregarded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each such employer its benefit cost ratio shall be subtracted from its reserve ratio. One-third of the resulting amount shall be subtracted from its benefit cost ratio. The resulting figure, expressed as a percentage and rounded to the nearest tenth of one percent, shall become its local government tax rate for the following rate year. For the rate year 1980 no tax rate shall be less than 0.6 percent nor more than 2.2 percent. For 1981 no tax rate shall be less than 0.4 percent nor more than 2.6 percent. For years after 1981 no tax rate shall be less than 0.2 percent or more than 3.0 percent. No individual rate shall be increased any more than 1.0 percent from one rate year to the next.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any county, city, or town electing participation under this section at any time after December 15, 1977, shall be assigned a tax rate of one and one-quarter percent of total remuneration for the first eight quarters of the participation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Local government tax&quot; shall be deemed to be &quot;contributions&quot; to the extent that such usage is consistent with the purposes of this title. Such construction shall include but not be limited to those portions of this title and the rules enacted pursuant thereto dealing with assessments, interest, penalties, liens, collection procedures and remedies, administrative and judicial review, and the imposition of administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The following prerequisite requirements must be met before making a determination about whether there is a &quot;contract,&quot; under RCW 50.44.050, or &quot;reasonable assurance,&quot; under RCW 50.44.050 and 50.44.055:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The offer of employment may be written, verbal, or implied, and must be made by an individual with actual authority to offer employment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The offer of employment provides that the employee will perform services in the same capacity during the ensuing academic year or term (or remainder of the current academic year or term) as in the first academic year or term; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The economic conditions of the offer of employment may not be considerably less in the following academic year or term (or portion thereof) than in the first academic year or term (or portion thereof). &quot;Considerably less&quot; includes the condition that the individual will not earn at least ninety percent of the wages earned in the prior academic year or term.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If all prerequisite requirements in subsection (1) of this section are satisfied, the department must determine if a contract exists. If any prerequisite in subsection (1) of this section is not satisfied, the department may not deny the claimant unemployment compensation based on the between and within term denial provisions. The term &quot;contract,&quot; as that term is used in this section and RCW 50.44.050, means an enforceable, noncontingent agreement that provides for compensation for an entire academic year or on an annual basis. If a contract exists, the claimant may be subject to a denial of benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If no contract exists, the department must determine if the claimant has &quot;reasonable assurance.&quot; The following factors will be considered in determining if an individual has &quot;reasonable assurance,&quot; as that term is used in this section, RCW 50.44.050, and 50.44.055. For reasonable assurance to exist, each factor must be satisfied.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If any contingencies in the employment offer are within the employer's control the claimant will not be considered to have reasonable assurance of employment. Contingencies within the employer's control include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Course programming;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Funding allocation decisions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Final course offerings; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facility availability.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If contingencies are not within the employer's control, the department must determine whether it is highly probable the contingencies contained within the offer will be satisfied. Primary weight will be given to the contingent nature of an offer of employment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reasonable assurance must be determined on a case-by-case basis considering the totality of circumstances rather than on the existence of any one factor. For an individual to have reasonable assurance of employment, the totality of the circumstances must show that it is highly probable that employment will be available in the next academic year or term, and that the contingencies of that employment will be satisfied.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An individual who is tenured or holds tenure track status is considered to have reasonable assurance, unless advised otherwise by the college. For the purposes of this section, tenure track status means a probationary faculty employee having an opportunity to be reviewed for tenure.</p>
</li>

<p>The legislature finds the interests of the state and its citizens are best served by a strong education system. Paramount to that system's success is the attraction and retention of qualified instructors. In order to attract and retain instructors, those who are subject to uncertainties of employment must be provided assurance that their economic needs are addressed. Contingent assurances of future employment are often speculative and do not rise to the level of other forms of assurance. As such, the factors presented in RCW 50.44.053 must be used to determine if reasonable assurance of employment exists.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that reasonable assurance continue to apply to all employees of educational institutions as required by federal provisions and RCW 50.44.080.</p>

The commissioner shall require adjustments to be made in a previously filed bond as he or she deems appropriate. If the bond is to be increased, the adjusted bond shall be filed by the organization within thirty days of the date notice of the required adjustment was mailed or otherwise delivered to it. Failure by any organization covered by such bond to pay the full amount of payments in lieu of contributions when due, together with any applicable interest and penalties provided for in this title, shall render the surety liable on said bond to the extent of the bond, as though the surety was such organization.</p>

<li>
<p>Any deposit of money or securities in accordance with this section shall be retained by the commissioner in an escrow account until liability under the election is terminated, at which time it shall be returned to the organization, less any deductions as hereinafter provided.

The commissioner shall require the organization within thirty days following any deduction from a money deposit or sale of deposited securities under the provisions of this subsection to deposit sufficient additional money or securities to make whole the organization's deposit at the prior level. Any cash remaining from the sale of such securities shall be a part of the organization's escrow account. The commissioner may, at any time review the adequacy of the deposit made by any organization. If, as a result of such review, he or she determines that an adjustment is necessary he or she shall require the organization to make an additional deposit within thirty days of written notice of his or her determination or shall return to it such portion of the deposit as he or she no longer considers necessary, whichever action is appropriate. Disposition of income from securities held in escrow shall be governed by the applicable provisions of the state law.</p>

<p>If any nonprofit organization fails to file a bond or make a deposit, or to file a bond in an increased amount or to increase or make whole the amount of a previously made deposit, as provided under this section, the commissioner may terminate such organization's election to make payments in lieu of contributions and such termination shall continue for not less than the four-consecutive-calendar-quarter period beginning with the quarter in which termination becomes effective: PROVIDED, That the commissioner may extend for good cause the applicable filing, deposit, or adjustment period by not more than thirty days.</p>
