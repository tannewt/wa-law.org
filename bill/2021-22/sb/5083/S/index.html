</li>
<li>
<p>The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this act unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Fiscal year 2022&quot; or &quot;FY 2022&quot; means the period beginning July 1, 2021, and ending June 30, 2022.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Fiscal year 2023&quot; or &quot;FY 2023&quot; means the period beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2023.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Lapse&quot; or &quot;revert&quot; means the amount shall return to an unappropriated status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Provided solely&quot; means the specified amount may be spent only for the specified purpose.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise specifically authorized in this act, any portion of an amount provided solely for a specified purpose that is not expended subject to the specified conditions and limitations to fulfill the specified purpose shall lapse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amounts shown under the headings &quot;Prior Biennia,&quot; &quot;Future Biennia,&quot; and &quot;Total&quot; in this act are for informational purposes only and do not constitute legislative approval of these amounts. &quot;Prior biennia&quot; typically refers to the immediate prior biennium for reappropriations, but may refer to multiple biennia in the case of specific projects. A &quot;future biennia&quot; amount is an estimate of what may be appropriated for the project or program in the 2023-2025 biennium and the following three biennia; an amount of zero does not necessarily constitute legislative intent to not provide funding for the project or program in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Reappropriations&quot; in this act are appropriations and, unless the context clearly provides otherwise, are subject to the relevant conditions and limitations applicable to appropriations. Reappropriations shall be limited to the unexpended balances remaining on June 30, 2021, from the 2019-2021 biennial appropriations for each project.</p>

<p>To ensure that major construction projects are carried out in accordance with legislative and executive intent, agencies must complete a predesign for state construction projects with a total anticipated cost in excess of $5,000,000, or $10,000,000 for higher education institutions. &quot;Total anticipated cost&quot; means the sum of the anticipated cost of the predesign, design, and construction phases of the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appropriations for design may not be expended or encumbered until the office of financial management has reviewed and approved the agency's predesign.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The predesign must explore at least three project alternatives. These alternatives must be both distinctly different and viable solutions to the issue being addressed. The chosen alternative should be the most reasonable and cost-effective solution. The predesign document must include, but not be limited to, program, site, and cost analysis, and an analysis of the life-cycle costs of the alternatives explored, in accordance with the predesign manual adopted by the office of financial management.</p>

<li>
<p>The legislature finds that use of life-cycle cost analysis will aid public entities, architects, engineers, and contractors in making design and construction decisions that positively impact both the initial construction cost and the ongoing operating and maintenance cost of a project. To ensure that the total cost of a project is accounted for and the most reasonable and cost efficient design is used, agencies shall develop life-cycle costs for any construction project over $10,000,000. The life-cycle costs must represent the present value sum of capital costs, installation costs, operating costs, and maintenance costs over the life expectancy of the project. The legislature further finds the most effective approach to the life-cycle cost analysis is to integrate it into the early part of the design process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agencies must develop a minimum of three project alternatives for use in the life-cycle cost analysis. These alternatives must be both distinctly different and viable solutions to the issue being addressed. Agencies must choose the most reasonable and cost-effective solution, as supported by the life-cycle cost analysis. A brief description of each project alternative and why it was chosen must be included in the life-cycle cost analysis section of the predesign.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of financial management shall: (a) Make available a life-cycle cost model to be used for analysis; (b) in consultation with the department of enterprise services, provide assistance in using the life-cycle cost model; and (c) update the life-cycle cost model annually including assumptions for inflation rates, discount rates, and energy rates.</p>

<p>The office of financial management may authorize a transfer of appropriation authority provided for a capital project that is in excess of the amount required for the completion of such project to another capital project for which the appropriation is insufficient. No such transfer may be used to expand the capacity of any facility beyond that intended in making the appropriation. Such transfers may be effected only between capital appropriations to a specific department, commission, agency, or institution of higher education and only between capital projects that are funded from the same fund or account. No transfers may occur between projects to local government agencies except where the grants are provided within a single omnibus appropriation and where such transfers are specifically authorized by the implementing statutes that govern the grants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of financial management may find that an amount is in excess of the amount required for the completion of a project only if: (a) The project as defined in the notes to the budget document is substantially complete and there are funds remaining; or (b) bids have been let on a project and it appears to a substantial certainty that the project as defined in the notes to the budget document can be completed within the biennium for less than the amount appropriated in this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, the intent is that each project be defined as proposed to the legislature in the governor's budget document, unless it clearly appears from the legislative history that the legislature intended to define the scope of a project in a different way.</p>

<p>Any building project that receives over $10,000,000 in funding from the capital budget must be built to sustainable standards. &quot;Sustainable building&quot; means a building that integrates and optimizes all major high-performance building attributes, including energy efficiency, durability, life-cycle performance, and occupant productivity, and minimizes greenhouse gas emissions. The following design and construction attributes must be integrated into the building project:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Employ integrated design principles: Use a collaborative, integrated planning and design process that initiates and maintains an integrated project team in all stages of a project's planning and delivery. Establish performance goals for siting, energy, water, materials, and indoor environmental quality along with other comprehensive design goals and ensures incorporation of these goals throughout the design and life-cycle of the building. Consider all stages of the building's life-cycle, including deconstruction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commissioning: Employ commissioning practices tailored to the size and complexity of the building and its system components in order to verify performance of building components and systems and help ensure that design requirements are met. This should include an experienced commissioning provider, inclusion of commissioning requirements in construction documents, a commissioning plan, verification of the installation and performance of systems to be commissioned, and a commissioning report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimize energy performance: Establish a whole building performance target that takes into account the intended use, occupancy, operations, plug loads, other energy demands, and design to earn the ENERGY STAR targets for new construction and major renovation where applicable. For new construction target low energy use index. For major renovations, target reducing energy use by fifty percent below prerenovations baseline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On-site renewable energy: Implement renewable energy generation projects on agency property for agency use, when life-cycle cost effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High-efficiency electric equipment: Use only high-efficiency electric equipment for water and space heating needs not met through on-site renewable energy, when life-cycle cost effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Measurement and verification: For buildings over 50,000 square feet, install building level electricity meters in new major construction and renovation projects to track and continuously optimize performance. Include equivalent meters for natural gas and steam, where natural gas and steam are used. Where appropriate, install dashboards inside buildings to display and incentivize occupants on energy use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Benchmarking: Compare performance data from the first year of operation with the energy design target. Verify that the building performance meets or exceeds the design target. For other building and space types, use an equivalent benchmarking tool.</p>

<li>
<p>By October 1st of each even-numbered year, the office of financial management shall complete an objective analysis and scoring of all capital budget projects proposed by the public four-year institutions of higher education and submit the results of the scoring process to the legislative fiscal committees and the four-year institutions. Each project must be reviewed and scored within one of the following categories, according to the project's principal purpose. Each project may be scored in only one category. The categories are:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Access‑related projects to accommodate enrollment growth at all campuses, at existing or new university centers, or through distance learning. Growth projects should provide significant additional student capacity. Proposed projects must demonstrate that they are based on solid enrollment demand projections, more cost‑effectively provide enrollment access than alternatives such as university centers and distance learning, and make cost‑effective use of existing and proposed new space;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Projects that replace failing permanent buildings. Facilities that cannot be economically renovated are considered replacement projects. New space may be programmed for the same or a different use than the space being replaced and may include additions to improve access and enhance the relationship of program or support space;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Projects that renovate facilities to restore building life and upgrade space to meet current program requirements. Renovation projects should represent a complete renovation of a total facility or an isolated wing of a facility. A reasonable renovation project should cost between sixty to eighty percent of current replacement value and restore the renovated area to at least twenty-five years of useful life. New space may be programmed for the same or a different use than the space being renovated and may include additions to improve access and enhance the relationship of program or support space;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Major stand-alone campus infrastructure projects;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Projects that promote economic growth and innovation through expanded research activity. The acquisition and installation of specialized equipment is authorized under this category; and</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The office of financial management, in consultation with the legislative fiscal committees, shall establish a scoring system and process for each four-year project category that is based on the framework used in the community and technical college system of prioritization. Staff from the state board for community and technical colleges and the four-year institutions shall provide technical assistance on the development of a scoring system and process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of financial management shall consult with the legislative fiscal committees in the scoring of four-year institution project proposals, and may also solicit participation by independent experts.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>For each four-year project category, the scoring system must, at a minimum, include an evaluation of enrollment trends, reasonableness of cost, the ability of the project to enhance specific strategic master plan goals, age and condition of the facility if applicable, and impact on space utilization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each four-year project category may include projects at the predesign, design, or construction funding phase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the extent possible, the objective analysis and scoring system of all capital budget projects shall occur within the context of any and all performance agreements between the office of financial management and the governing board of a public, four-year institution of higher education that aligns goals, priorities, desired outcomes, flexibility, institutional mission, accountability, and levels of resources.</p>

The office of financial management, in consultation with the legislative fiscal committees, shall develop common definitions that four-year institutions must use in developing their project proposals and lists under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In developing any scoring system for capital projects proposed by the four-year institutions, the office of financial management:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Shall be provided with all required information by the four-year institutions as deemed necessary by the office of financial management;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May utilize independent services to verify, sample, or evaluate information provided to the office of financial management by the four-year institutions; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shall have full access to all data maintained by the joint legislative audit and review committee concerning the condition of higher education facilities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>By August 1st of each even-numbered year each public four-year higher education institution shall prepare and submit prioritized lists of the individual projects proposed by the institution for the ensuing six-year period in each category. The lists must be submitted to the office of financial management and the legislative fiscal committees. The four-year institutions may aggregate minor works project proposals by primary purpose for ranking purposes. Proposed minor works projects must be prioritized within the aggregated proposal, and supporting documentation, including project descriptions and cost estimates, must be provided to the office of financial management and the legislative fiscal committees.</p>
