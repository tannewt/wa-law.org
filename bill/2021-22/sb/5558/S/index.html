<p>The legislature finds and declares that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Interstate toll bridges owned by local governments provide critical links for the transport of workers, services, tourism, and emergency response between Washington and Oregon, and for Washington and Oregon businesses to transport local agricultural products, forest products, rock and gravel, and manufactured products within their bistate regions and to broader national markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Existing local government-owned interstate toll bridges are becoming functionally obsolete, weight-restricted, seismically deficient, and a hazardous obstacle for marine freight; and need to be replaced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replacement of aging interstate toll bridges by local governments is extremely challenging, and local governments that own or are served by the bridges require additional means to address the problem. For some bistate regions, the successful replacement and subsequent operations of interstate toll bridges can be best accomplished by an independent bistate governmental authority, chartered by local governments, with sufficient powers to efficiently and equitably develop, operate, maintain, toll, and finance the replacement bridge.</p>

<li>
<p>Upon enactment of an act by a bordering state having the same material effect as this act, as determined by the office of the attorney general, local governments may enter into a commission formation agreement to form and charter a commission under this chapter. The commission shall be a public corporation formed under the laws of both states, vested with the powers and duties granted by this chapter.

The commission formation agreement shall, at a minimum, be approved and executed by the owner of an existing bridge and the governing bodies of the counties within which an existing bridge is situated. A commission formation agreement may be enacted by local governments in phases. However, all required elements of a commission formation agreement must be enacted by the local governments prior to any board authorization to issue toll revenue bonds for the construction of the bridge. The commission formation agreement shall establish the following provisions:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission formation agreement may allow the board to amend all or some of the provisions included in the commission formation agreement pursuant to subsection (2)(d), (e), (f), or (g) of this section and section 4(5) of this act, and may establish conditions for such amendments.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The commission shall be governed by a board. The commission formation agreement shall establish the number of voting and, if any, nonvoting or ex officio directors appointed by local governments of each state and, if any, appointed by governmental entities that are not local governments, and shall further establish the procedures for the nomination and appointment of such directors, which may differ by state.</p>
</li>

Unless the context requires otherwise, the term director under this chapter includes the alternate director when such alternate director is acting in the absence of the director.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Directors and alternate directors shall serve without compensation, but may be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred as an incident to the performance of their duties.

<p>Formal actions of the board shall be by ordinance or resolution duly approved at any regular or special meeting of the board. No action of the board shall be effective unless there is a quorum and a majority of the directors present assent. The commission formation agreement shall establish the requirements for a quorum, and may establish such other requirements for formal actions of the board as the local governments may elect, provided such requirements are consistent with applicable laws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise provided in an ordinance or resolution enacted by the board, the board shall have the exclusive right to exercise the powers granted by this chapter, and the exercise of all powers granted to the board by this chapter shall not be subject to any prior or subsequent authorization, approval, or concurrence by any local government or other governmental entity of either state.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall furnish such information with respect to its affairs as may be requested by the state of Washington, bordering state, or any local government.

<h2 id="section-8-112">Section 8 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-8-112">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The board shall have the exclusive power to impose, fix, and periodically adjust the rate of tolls and other charges for use of any bridge owned by or operated by the commission without any approval, authorization, or concurrence by a legislature, state toll authority, local government, state agency or official, or other entity. The board may establish and implement such policies and criteria as the board deems advisable for the rate of tolls and other charges including, but not limited to, establishing discounts, exemptions, administrative fees, late fees, civil penalties, and toll rates for such classes of vehicles and users as the board may determine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In setting and periodically adjusting toll rates and other charges, the board shall ensure that toll rates and other charges will annually yield revenue sufficient to meet all costs, expenses, and obligations of the commission, including the satisfaction of all financial and other covenants made by the commission with regard to any bond or other debt instrument.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission may enter agreements with the Washington state department of licensing and the applicable agency of the bordering state to enforce the payment of tolls and other charges for use of the bridge. Such agreements may provide that if the commission or its designee gives notice to the applicable department that a person has not paid a toll or other charge for use of the bridge, the applicable department shall refuse to renew the motor vehicle registration of the motor vehicle operated by the person at the time of the violation. The applicable department may renew such motor vehicle registration upon receipt of a notice from the commission or its designee indicating that all tolls and other charges owed by the person have been paid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Photo toll systems may take photographs, digital photographs, microphotographs, videotapes, or other recorded images of the vehicle and vehicle license plate only. A photo toll image of a vehicle and the registration plate of the vehicle produced by a photo toll system at the time the driver of the vehicle did not pay a toll is prima facie evidence that the registered owner of the vehicle is the driver of the vehicle. However, if the registered owner of a vehicle is a person in the vehicle rental or leasing business, the registered owner may elect to identify the person who was operating the vehicle at the time the toll was not paid or to pay the toll, civil penalty, and administrative fee. A registered owner of a vehicle who pays the toll, civil penalty, and administrative fee is entitled to recover the same from the driver, renter, or lessee of the vehicle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rights to enforce the payment of tolls and other charges of the commission granted under this chapter are supplemental; the commission may employ all other remedies available to it under the laws of the state of Washington and the bordering state.</p>

<li>
<p>The proceeds from toll rates and other charges of the commission shall only be used to pay the necessary and incidental costs and expenses incurred by the commission in connection with owning, constructing, operating, maintaining, renewing, and governing the bridge, which shall include, but not be limited to, costs incurred for:</p>

<p>The commission may grant to any public or private entity by franchise, lease, or otherwise the use or control of any portion of the bridge or any property or facility owned or under the control of the commission, and may fix the terms, conditions, rents, and other payments for such use.</p>
