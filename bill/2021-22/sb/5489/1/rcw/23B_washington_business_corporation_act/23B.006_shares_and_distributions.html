<p>A good faith determination by the board of directors that the consideration received or to be received for the shares to be issued is adequate is conclusive insofar as the adequacy of consideration relates to whether the shares are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

<li>
<p>The articles of incorporation, bylaws, an agreement among shareholders, or an agreement between shareholders and the corporation may impose restrictions on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares of the corporation. A restriction does not affect shares issued before the restriction was adopted unless the holders of the shares are parties to the restriction agreement or voted in favor of the restriction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares is valid and enforceable against the holder or a transferee of the holder if the restriction is authorized by this section and its existence is noted conspicuously on the front or back of the certificate or is contained in the information statement required by RCW 23B.06.260(2). Unless so noted, a restriction is not enforceable against a person without knowledge of the restriction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares is authorized:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>To maintain the corporation's status when it is dependent on the number or identity of its shareholders;</p>

<p>The shareholders of a corporation do not have a preemptive right to acquire the corporation's unissued shares except to the extent the articles of incorporation provide otherwise or as set forth in subsection (2) of this section. A statement included in the articles of incorporation that &quot;the corporation elects to have preemptive rights,&quot; or words of similar import, means that the provisions set forth in subsection (3) of this section apply except to the extent that the articles of incorporation provide otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, the shareholders of a corporation formed before January 1, 2020, have a preemptive right to acquire the corporation's unissued shares.</p>

<li>
<p>If shareholders of a corporation have a preemptive right to acquire the corporation's unissued shares under this section, the following provisions apply:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, such preemptive right is granted on uniform terms and conditions prescribed by the board of directors to provide a fair and reasonable opportunity to exercise the right, to acquire proportional amounts of the corporation's unissued shares upon the decision of the board of directors to issue them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, a shareholder may waive the shareholder's preemptive right. A waiver evidenced by a writing is irrevocable even though it is not supported by consideration.</p>

<p>Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, there is no preemptive right with respect to:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Shares issued as compensation to directors, officers, agents, employees, or other service providers of the corporation, or its subsidiaries or affiliates;</p>

<p>Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise:</p>

<li>
<p>Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, shares subject to preemptive rights that are not acquired by shareholders may be issued to any person for a period of one year after being offered to shareholders at a consideration set by the board of directors that is not lower than the consideration set for the exercise of preemptive rights.

<p>A board of directors may approve and the corporation may make distributions to its shareholders subject to restriction by the articles of incorporation and the limitation in subsection (3) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The board of directors may fix the record date for determining shareholders entitled to a distribution, which date may not precede the date on which the resolution fixing the record date is approved by the board of directors. If the board of directors does not fix a record date for determining shareholders entitled to a distribution, other than one involving a purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of the corporation's shares, the record date is the date the board of directors authorizes the distribution.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No distribution may be made if, after giving it effect:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The corporation would not be able to pay its liabilities as they become due in the usual course of business; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The corporation's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus, unless the articles of incorporation permit otherwise, the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of determinations under subsection (3) of this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The board of directors may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection (3) of this section either on financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances or on a fair valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indebtedness of a corporation, including indebtedness issued as a distribution, is not considered a liability if its terms provide that payment of principal and interest are made only if and to the extent that payment of a distribution to shareholders could then be made under this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The effect of a distribution under subsection (3) of this section is measured:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>In the case of a distribution of indebtedness, the terms of which provide that payment of principal and interest are made only if and to the extent that payment of a distribution to shareholders could then be made under this section, each payment of principal or interest is treated as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date the payment is actually made; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of any other distribution:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>If the distribution is by purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of the corporation's shares, the effect of the distribution is measured as of the earlier of the date any money or other property is transferred or debt incurred by the corporation, or the date the shareholder ceases to be a shareholder with respect to the acquired shares;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the distribution is of indebtedness other than that described in  (a) and (b)(i) of this <strong>sub</strong>section, the effect of the distribution is measured as of the date the indebtedness is distributed; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In all other cases, the effect of the distribution is measured as of the date the distribution is approved if payment occurs within one hundred twenty days after the date of approval, or the date the payment is made if it occurs more than one hundred twenty days after the date of approval.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A corporation's indebtedness to a shareholder incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the corporation's indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors except to the extent provided otherwise by agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In circumstances to which this section and related sections of this title are applicable, such provisions supersede the applicability of any other statutes of this state with respect to the legality of distributions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A transfer of the assets of a dissolved corporation to a trust or other successor entity of the type described in RCW 23B.14.030(4) constitutes a distribution subject to subsection (3) of this section only when and to the extent that the trust or successor entity distributes assets to shareholders.</p>
