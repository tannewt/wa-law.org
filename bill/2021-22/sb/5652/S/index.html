<p>The transfer of funds in section 7 of this act is intended to pay the full cost of the benefit improvements in sections 1 and 2 of this act for current law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system plan 2 members so that contribution rates under the plan's minimum funding policy for those members will not increase as a result of this benefit improvement. To accomplish this goal, after the transfer of funds in section 7 of this act the office of the state actuary must calculate a rate reduction to be applied to rates calculated in sections 4(5) (a) and (b) and 5(4) (a) and (b) of this act. This rate must be calculated in time for it to go into effect on July 1, 2025, using any data, assumptions, and methods the office of the state actuary believes are reasonable for this purpose.</p>
