<p>&quot;Benchmark replacement&quot; means a benchmark, or an interest rate or dividend rate, which may or may not be based in whole or in part on a prior setting of the LIBOR, to replace the LIBOR or any interest rate or dividend rate based on the LIBOR, whether on a temporary, permanent, or indefinite basis, under or in respect of a contract, security, or instrument.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>If, in the reasonable judgment of the calculating person, the benchmark replacement conforming changes selected or recommended pursuant to (a) of this subsection do not apply to such contract, security, or instrument or are insufficient to permit administration and calculation of the recommended benchmark replacement, then benchmark replacement conforming changes shall include such other changes, alterations, or modifications that, in the reasonable judgment of the calculating person:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Are necessary to permit administration and calculation of the recommended benchmark replacement under or in respect of such contract, security, or instrument in a manner consistent with market practice for substantially similar contracts, securities, or instruments and, to the extent practicable, the manner in which such contract, security, or instrument was administered immediately prior to the LIBOR replacement date; and</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>On the LIBOR replacement date, the recommended benchmark replacement shall, by operation of law, be the benchmark replacement for any contract, security, or instrument that uses the LIBOR as a benchmark and:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Contains no fallback provisions; or</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following the occurrence of a LIBOR discontinuance event, any fallback provisions in a contract, security, or instrument that provide for a benchmark replacement based on or otherwise involving a poll, survey, or inquiries for quotes or information concerning interbank lending rates or any interest rate or dividend rate based on the LIBOR shall be disregarded as if not included in such contract, security, or instrument and shall be deemed null and void and without any force or effect.</p>

<li>
<p>If a recommended benchmark replacement becomes the benchmark replacement for any contract, security, or instrument pursuant to subsection (1) or (3) of this section, then all benchmark replacement conforming changes that are applicable, in accordance with the definition of benchmark replacement conforming changes, to such recommended benchmark replacement shall become an integral part of such contract, security, or instrument by operation of law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provisions of this chapter shall not alter or impair:</p>

<li>
<p>Any contract, security, or instrument that contains fallback provisions that would result in a benchmark replacement that is not based on the LIBOR including, but not limited to, the prime rate or the federal funds rate, except that such contract, security, or instrument shall be subject to subsection (2) of this section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any contract, security, or instrument subject to subsection (3) of this section as to which a determining person does not elect to use a recommended benchmark replacement pursuant to subsection (3) of this section or as to which a determining person elects to use a recommended benchmark replacement prior to the occurrence of a LIBOR discontinuance event, except that such contract, security, or instrument shall be subject to subsection (2) of this section; or</p>
