<p>It is the intent of the legislature to create a concurrent licensing process to allow the owner of a motorcycle to maintain concurrent but separate registrations for the vehicle, for use as a motorcycle and for use as a snow bike.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall allow the owner of a motorcycle to maintain concurrent licenses for the vehicle for use as a motorcycle and for use as a snow bike. When the vehicle is registered as a motorcycle, the terms of the registration are those under this chapter that apply to motorcycles, including applicable fees. When the vehicle is registered as a snow bike, the terms of the registration are those under chapter 46.10 RCW that apply to snowmobiles, including applicable fees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall establish a declaration subject to the requirements of *RCW 9A.72.085, which must be submitted by the motorcycle owner when initially applying for a snowmobile registration under chapter 46.10 RCW for the use of the converted motorcycle as a snow bike. The declaration must include a statement signed by the owner that a motorcycle that had been previously converted to a snow bike must conform with all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards and state standards while in use as a motorcycle upon public roads, streets, or highways. Once submitted by the motorcycle owner, the declaration is valid until the vehicle is sold or the title is otherwise transferred.</p>
