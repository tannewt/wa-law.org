<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/46_motor_vehicles/46.16A_registration.html">46.16A.110</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/46_motor_vehicles/46.16A_registration.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A registered owner or the registered owner's authorized representative must apply for a renewal vehicle registration to the department, county auditor or other agent, or subagent appointed by the director on a form approved by the director. The application for a renewal vehicle registration must be accompanied by a draft, money order, certified bank check, or cash for all fees and taxes required by law for the application for a renewal vehicle registration**, except as allowed under subsection (6) of this section**.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<p>a. When a vehicle changes ownership, the person taking ownership or his or her authorized representative must apply for a renewal vehicle registration as provided in subsection (1) of this section and, except as provided in (b) of this subsection, pay all the taxes and fees that are due at the time of registration renewal. For the purposes of this section, when a vehicle is sold to a vehicle dealer for resale, the application for a renewal registration need not be made until the vehicle is sold by the vehicle dealer.</p>
<p>b. The person taking ownership or his or her authorized representative must be given credit for the portion of a motor vehicle excise tax, including the motor vehicle excise tax collected under RCW 81.104.160, that reflects the remaining period for which the tax was initially paid by the previous owner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An application and the fees and taxes for a renewal vehicle registration must be handled in the same manner as an original vehicle registration application. The registration does not need to show the name of the lienholder when the application for renewal vehicle registration becomes the renewal registration upon validation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person expecting to be out of state during the normal renewal period of a vehicle registration may renew a vehicle registration and have license plates or tabs preissued by applying for a renewal as described in subsection (1) of this section. A vehicle registration may be renewed for the subsequent registration year up to eighteen months before the current expiration date and must be displayed from the date of issue or from the day of the expiration of the current registration year, whichever date is later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An application for a renewal vehicle registration is not required for those vehicles owned, rented, or leased by:</p>
<p>a. The state of Washington, or by any county, city, town, school district, or other political subdivision of the state of Washington; or</p>
<p>b. A governing body of an Indian tribe located within this state and recognized as a governmental entity by the United States department of the interior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If the sum of all fees and taxes required by law for the application for a renewal vehicle registration exceeds $150, the registered owner or the registered owner's authorized representative may****enter into a quarterly payment plan with the department for the amount of fees and taxes due. The quarterly payments must each be of an equal amount, except when the entire remaining amount of the fees and taxes due is paid. The first quarterly payment must be made with the application for a renewal vehicle registration. The department shall charge a one-time fee of four percent of each vehicle registration transaction when a quarterly payment plan is entered into and the fee may be divided between the quarterly payments. This fee must be deposited in the motor vehicle fund created in RCW 46.68.070. Revenue from this new fee may only be used for additional direct costs to allow quarterly payment plans. The department, in collaboration with counties and subagents, shall develop and periodically update a cost allocation method to share the fee revenue based on the proportional additional costs borne by each entity in allowing quarterly payment plans. The cost allocation method must be included in the agency biennial budget submittal each biennium. Payments made under this subsection after the application for a renewal vehicle registration are not subject to additional fees under RCW 46.17.040(1)(b), 46.17.005, 46.17.025, or 46.17.015.</strong></p>

<p>a. Fifteen dollars for changes in a certificate of title, changes in ownership for nontitled vehicles, or for verification of record and preparation of an affidavit of lost title other than at the time of the certificate of title application or transfer, in addition to any other fees or taxes due at the time of application; and</p>
<p>b. Eight dollars for a registration renewal, issuing a transit permit, or any other service under this section, in addition to any other fees or taxes due at the time of application**, except payments made after the initial payment made with the application for a renewal vehicle registration under RCW 46.16A.110(6)**.</p>

However, the tax shall in no case be less than two dollars except for proportionally registered vehicles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A vehicle is deemed registered for the first time in this state when the vehicle was not previously registered by this state for the registration year immediately preceding the registration year in which the application for registration is made or when the vehicle has been registered in another jurisdiction subsequent to any prior registration in this state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An additional tax may not be imposed under this chapter on any vehicle when the certificate of title is being transferred if the tax has already been paid for the registration year or fraction of a registration year in which transfer of ownership occurs**. However, the department may continue to collect any remaining payments due as required by a payment plan entered into pursuant to RCW 46.16A.110(6)**.</p>
