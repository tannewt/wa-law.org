<h2 id="section-1-114">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-114">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds and declares that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The existence of accessible affordable health care services that are responsive to the needs of the community is an important public policy goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic has laid bare both the crucial importance of our health care systems and the inequities that exist and exacerbate harm to marginalized communities, including in access to and delivery of affordable, quality care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acquisitions of health care systems and facilities impact cost, quality, and access to health care, and affect working conditions and employee benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health system and facility acquisitions can result in a lack of price competition, and also a lack of any meaningful choice among health care providers within a community or geographic region. These negative outcomes are exacerbated for those in rural areas with few health care providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature is committed to ensuring that Washingtonians have access to the full range of reproductive, end-of-life, and gender affirming health care services. Yet, Washingtonians continue to experience difficulty accessing gender affirming care, and hospital system acquisitions in Washington state have resulted in material reductions in reproductive and end-of-life health care services, to the detriment of communities and patients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health system acquisitions must improve, rather than harm, access to affordable quality health care.</p>
</li>
</ol>
