<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that gas and electrical companies face transformational change brought on by new technology, rapidly changing costs, emerging opportunities for customers, and public policy mandates. Policy mandates, such as chapter 19.405 RCW, the clean energy transformation act, mean these companies must find innovative and creative solutions to equitably serve their customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the traditional regulatory construct is neither adaptable, nor well suited to adjusting to rapidly changing societal expectations and public policy objectives, and therefore hinders the ability of gas and electrical companies to effectively evolve to meet new challenges and opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In particular, the legislature finds that traditional cost of service regulation may lead to a significant delay in recovery of costs for gas and electrical companies. This regulatory lag creates barriers to companies making the investments necessary to meet public policy objectives and expectations. The traditional regulatory process results in a backward-looking annual cycle of rate cases that may limit the ability of gas and electrical companies and customers in achieving the state's energy policy goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that the regulatory construct should require a forward-looking orientation for regulation consistent with state policy objectives that focus on planning, flexibility, and fair allocation of risks, while fostering and supporting a culture that delivers performance and cost control in this new industry environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that the regulation of gas and electrical companies transform toward multiyear rate plans and performance-based rate making to provide certainty and stability to customers and gas and electrical companies, with those plans focused on ensuring alignment of public policy objectives, investment, safety, and reliability.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A gas or electrical company shall file a multiyear rate plan as provided in this chapter and the commission shall approve the proposal, with or without conditions, or reject it. The commission shall approve a proposal for a multiyear rate plan if the commission finds that the plan establishes just and reasonable rates for the gas or electrical company, is lawful, is supported by an appropriate record, and is consistent with the public interest in light of all the information available to the commission at the time of the commission's decision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A gas or electric company may propose and the commission may approve any proposal to recover from ratepayers up to five percent of the total approved revenue requirement approved by the commission for the initial rate year for tariffs that expand the affordability of services available to customers including, but not limited to: (a) Bill assistance programs for low-income residential customers; or (b) one or more special rates for low-income residential customers to reduce the energy burden of those customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to RCW 80.04.130, the commission has the authority, upon its own motion, upon complaint, or upon notice, to enter upon a hearing concerning such a proposal and the reasonableness and justness of the proposal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless the commission finds that the multiyear rate plan is not just and reasonable or not in the public interest, the commission shall accept a proposal filed by a gas or electrical company in support of, or an alternative proposal presented by parties in response to, a multiyear rate plan filing that seeks to recover the company's annual revenue requirement in each future rate year on the basis of a budget approved by the company, a forecast, a clean energy implementation plan approved under RCW 19.405.060, a price index, a fixed escalation rate, or another formula, individually or in combination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In considering a multiyear rate plan proposal, the commission shall minimize regulatory lag in each future rate year to the fullest extent possible while maintaining rates that are fair, just, reasonable, and sufficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall separately approve rates for each of the initial rate year, the second rate year and, if applicable, the third rate year, and the fourth rate year. Consistent with RCW 80.04.250, the commission shall ascertain and determine the fair value for rate-making purposes of the property of any gas or electrical company that has filed a multiyear rate plan pursuant to this section that is or will be used and useful for service in this state by or during each rate year of the multiyear rate plan. For the initial rate year, the commission shall, at a minimum, ascertain and determine the fair value for rate-making purposes of the property of any gas or electrical company that has filed a multiyear rate plan pursuant to this section that is used and useful for service in this state as of the rate effective date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission may, by order, establish terms, conditions, and procedures for a multiyear rate plan and ensure that rates remain just and reasonable during the course of the plan, including terms and procedures for rate adjustment during the term of the plan.</p>

<p>The gas or electrical company is bound by the terms of the multiyear rate plan approved by the commission for as long as the actual rate of return of the gas or electrical company remains within .5 percent of the rate of return authorized by the commission in the multiyear rate plan for such a company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If adjusted quarterly financial reports demonstrate that the actual rate of return of a gas or electrical company operating under a multiyear rate plan approved by the commission pursuant to this section remains within .5 percent of the rate of return authorized by the commission in the multiyear rate plan for such a company, the company may not file revised tariffs in the subsequent calendar quarter of the multiyear rate plan, the effect of which is to change rates affected by the multiyear rate plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If adjusted quarterly financial reports demonstrate that the actual rate of return of a gas or electrical company operating under a multiyear rate plan approved by the commission pursuant to this section is more than .5 percent less than the rate of return authorized by the commission in the multiyear rate plan for such a company, the company may file any of the following in the subsequent calendar quarter of the multiyear rate plan, the effect of which could be to change rates affected by the multiyear rate plan:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Proposed modifications to the existing multiyear rate plan for approval or rejection by the commission within four months of the date of filing of such a modification;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A request for deferral of costs of the utility for later determination by the commission;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A general rate case; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new multiyear rate plan in accordance with this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this subsection, a quarterly financial report must depict gas or electric operations of a gas or electrical company, respectively, under normal temperature and power supply conditions during the reporting period. Such a quarterly financial report must follow the methods approved by the commission for reporting financial results of operations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission may, in approving a multiyear rate plan, determine a set of reasonable and applicable performance measures that can be used to assess a gas or electrical company operating under a multiyear rate plan. These performance measures may be proposed by the gas or electrical company in its initial application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section precludes any gas or electrical company from making filings required or permitted by the commission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A gas or electrical company may defer, without interest, any new costs, unknown at the time of the approval of any multiyear rate plan then in effect, that are associated with compliance of any governmental policy or plan not in existence as of the rate effective date and implemented during a multiyear rate plan. Recovery of these deferred costs must be addressed in the next applicable rate case or multiyear rate plan of the applicable gas or electrical company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall align, to the extent practical, the timing of approval of a multiyear rate plan of an electrical company submitted pursuant to this section with the clean energy implementation plan of the electrical company filed pursuant to RCW 19.405.060.</p>

<p>Gas and electrical companies maintain programs offering incentives for single-family and multifamily housing owners to have conservation and energy efficiency measures financed and installed at their premises. The owners of single-family and multifamily rental housing may be reluctant to participate in these programs when they are required to financially supplement the company's incentive to fully fund cost-effective conservation and energy efficiency measures.
