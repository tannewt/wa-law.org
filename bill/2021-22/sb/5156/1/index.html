<h2 id="section-1-1352">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1352">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the COVID-19 pandemic has created significant economic consequences for people, businesses, and communities across the state. Prior to the pandemic, approximately 250,000 households in Washington struggled to pay rent. According to the United States census bureau, nearly 75,000 households are not current on rent or mortgage payments and could face eviction or foreclosure in the near future. Small businesses have struggled to remain operational under necessary public health measures, especially those in hardest-hit industries such as restaurants and event venues.</p>
<p>To address these serious impacts, a total of $315,000,000 has been allocated to the department of commerce from the federal coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act for rent assistance and small business and nonprofit assistance. However, as the pandemic endures, additional relief will be necessary to prevent future evictions and business closures.</p>
<p>This act appropriates $200,000,000 from the budget stabilization account to address the immediate financial crises of households and small businesses. The intent of the appropriations is to prevent future evictions due to nonpayment of rent and to keep businesses in operation, especially those that have been impacted by recent public health restrictions or that have experienced significant, cumulative economic impacts. The amounts appropriated will be provided to the department of commerce for a rental assistance program and a small business assistance grant program.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-1075">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-1075">¶</a></h2>
<p>The sum of $100,000,000 is appropriated from the budget stabilization account for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021. The appropriation is provided solely for expenditure into the home security fund account, and is provided solely for a rental assistance program, as provided in section 3 of this act.</p>
<h2 id="section-3-809">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-809">¶</a></h2>

To be eligible for the program, applicants must, at a minimum, have an income at or below 80 percent of the area median income, and have a missed or partially paid rent payment. Rental payments made through the program will be provided directly to landlords. The department may determine additional eligibility criteria in order to target these resources to households most likely to become homeless if they do not receive rental assistance.</p>
