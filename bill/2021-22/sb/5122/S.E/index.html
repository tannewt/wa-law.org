<h2 id="section-1-1250">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1250">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the goal of the juvenile justice system should be to protect public safety, connect youth with age-appropriate services that reduce the risk of recidivism, and provide meaningful rehabilitation so all youth can have the opportunity for success in life. The legislature declares that responses to problematic behaviors of youth should be guided by evidence-based practices and that policy changes to the system should be strongly rooted in eliminating racial inequities.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that a scientific consensus has developed that demonstrates that youth continue to develop neurologically until age 26. The legislature finds that youth ages eight through 12 are less capable of making fully informed decisions and youth ages 18 and 19 are particularly susceptible to outside factors influencing their decision making.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that on January 18, 2021, the Washington state board of health released a review regarding the health impacts of raising the age of the juvenile court's jurisdiction to likely decrease the juvenile criminal legal system's involvement for some youth ages eight through 12 and to likely decrease the adult criminal legal system's involvement for some emerging adults ages 18 and 19. The board further found very strong evidence that this would decrease juvenile recidivism and improve health outcomes, access to employment opportunities, housing access, and economic stability.</p>
<p>The legislature intends to amend jurisdiction of juvenile court to include youth ages 13 through 19, with certain exceptions. The legislature recognizes the important role that local governments play in ensuring access to justice in the juvenile court system. The legislature recognizes that amended jurisdiction in juvenile court may increase expenses for juvenile court systems despite significant offset savings in the adult system through reduced adult caseloads. The legislature intends to partner with local governments, courts, and other stakeholders to ensure successful expansion of juvenile court jurisdiction. The legislature therefore resolves to convene the raise the age juvenile justice task force to examine and plan for implementation of expanded juvenile court jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Children under the age of <strong>13</strong> years are incapable of committing crime. Children of eight <strong>through</strong> twelve years of age <strong>who are charged with murder in the first or second degree</strong> are presumed to be incapable of committing crime, but this presumption may be <strong>rebutted by clear and convincing evidence</strong> that they have sufficient capacity to understand the act or neglect, and to know that it was wrong. Whenever in legal proceedings it becomes necessary to determine the age of a child, he or she may be produced for inspection, to enable the court or jury to determine the age thereby; and the court may also direct his or her examination by one or more physicians, whose opinion shall be competent evidence upon the question of his or her age.</p>
