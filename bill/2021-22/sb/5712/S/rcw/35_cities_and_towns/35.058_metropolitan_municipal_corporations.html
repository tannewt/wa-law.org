<p>It is hereby declared to be the public policy of the state of Washington to provide for the people of the populous metropolitan areas in the state the means of obtaining essential services not adequately provided by existing agencies of local government. The growth of urban population and the movement of people into suburban areas has created problems of water pollution abatement, garbage disposal, water supply, transportation, planning, parks and parkways which extend beyond the boundaries of cities, counties and special districts. For reasons of topography, location and movement of population, and land conditions and development, one or more of these problems cannot be adequately met by the individual cities, counties and districts of many metropolitan areas.</p>
<p>It is the purpose of this chapter to enable cities and counties to act jointly to meet these common problems in order that the proper growth and development of the metropolitan areas of the state may be assured and the health and welfare of the people residing therein may be secured.</p>

A metropolitan municipal corporation may charge property owners seeking to connect to the sewage facilities of the metropolitan municipal corporation as a condition to granting the right to so connect, in addition to the cost of such connection, such reasonable capacity charge as the legislative body of the metropolitan municipal corporation shall determine proper in order that such property owners shall bear their equitable share of the cost of such system. The equitable share may include interest charges applied from the date of construction of the sewage facilities until the connection, or for a period not to exceed ten years, at a rate commensurate with the rate of interest applicable to the metropolitan municipal corporation at the time of construction or major rehabilitation of the sewage facilities, or at the time of installation of the sewer lines to which the property owner is seeking to connect but not to exceed ten percent per year: PROVIDED, That the aggregate amount of interest shall not exceed the equitable share of the cost of the sewage facilities allocated to such property owners. Capacity charges collected shall be considered revenue of the sewage facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The council of the metropolitan municipal corporation shall enforce the collection of the capacity charge in the same manner provided for the collection, enforcement, and payment of rates and charges for water-sewer districts provided in RCW 57.08.081. At least thirty days before commencement of an action to foreclose a lien for a capacity charge, the metropolitan municipal corporation shall send written notice of delinquency in payment of the capacity charge to any first mortgage or deed of trust holder of record at the address of record.</p>
