<p>The department is authorized to lease public lands for the purpose of prospecting for, developing, and producing oil, gas, or other hydrocarbon substances. Each such lease is to be composed of not more than six hundred forty acres or an entire government surveyed section, except a lease on river bed, lake bed, tide and submerged lands which is to be composed of not more than one thousand nine hundred twenty acres. All leases shall contain such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the rules adopted by the commissioner in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Leases may be for an initial term of from five up to ten years and shall be extended for so long thereafter as lessee shall comply with one of the following conditions: (1) Prosecute development on the leased land with the due diligence of a prudent operator upon encountering oil, gas, or other hydrocarbon substances; (2) produce any of said substances from the leased lands; (3) engage in drilling, deepening, repairing, or redrilling any well thereon; or (4) participate in a unit plan to which the commissioner has consented under RCW 78.52.450.</p>

Royalties payable by the lessee shall be the royalties from production as provided for in RCW 79.14.070 or the minimum royalty provided herein, whichever is greater. However, if such a lease is unitized, the minimum royalty shall be payable only on the leased acreage after production is obtained in such paying quantities from such lease.</p>

Otherwise, the cancellation shall be made and all rights of the lessee under the lease shall automatically terminate, except that lessee shall retain the right to continue its possession and operation of any well or wells in regard to which lessee is not in default. Further, failure to pay rental and royalty required under leases within the time prescribed therein shall automatically and without notice work a forfeiture of such leases and of all rights thereunder. Upon the expiration, forfeiture, or surrender of any lease, no new lease covering the lands or any of them embraced by such expired, forfeited, or surrendered lease, shall be issued for a period of ten days following the date of such expiration, forfeiture, or surrender.

Such lease shall provide for the payment to the state of a royalty, according to the grade of coal, for each ton of two thousand pounds of merchantable coal taken from the lands, as follows: For lignite coal of the class commonly found in Lewis and Thurston counties, not less than ten cents per ton; for subbituminous coal, not less than fifteen cents per ton; for high grade bituminous and coking coals, not less than twenty cents per ton; but such lease shall provide for the payment each year of a minimum royalty of not less than one nor more than ten dollars an acre for the lands covered thereby.
