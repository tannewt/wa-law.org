<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/43_state_government%E2%80%94executive/43.360_washington_main_street_program.html">43.360.030</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/43_state_government%E2%80%94executive/43.360_washington_main_street_program.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The department shall adopt criteria for the designation of local downtown or neighborhood commercial district revitalization programs and official local main street programs. In establishing the criteria, the department shall consider:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The degree of interest and commitment to comprehensive downtown or neighborhood commercial district revitalization and, where applicable, historic preservation by both the public and private sectors;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The evidence of potential private sector investment in the downtown or neighborhood commercial district;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where applicable, a downtown or neighborhood commercial district with sufficient historic fabric to become a foundation for an enhanced community image;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The capacity of the organization to undertake a comprehensive program and the financial commitment to implement a long-term downtown or neighborhood commercial district revitalization program that includes a commitment to employ a professional program manager and maintain a sufficient operating budget;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department's existing downtown revitalization program's tier system;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The national main street center's criteria for designating official main street cities; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other factors the department deems necessary for the designation of a local program.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall designate local downtown or neighborhood commercial district revitalization programs and official local main street programs. The programs shall be limited to three categories of designation, one of which shall be the main street level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RCW <strong>43.360.020</strong> does not apply to any local downtown or neighborhood commercial district revitalization program unless the boundaries of the program have been identified and approved by the department. The boundaries of a local downtown or neighborhood commercial district revitalization program are typically defined using the pedestrian core of a traditional commercial district.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may not designate a local downtown or neighborhood commercial district revitalization program or official local main street program if the program is undertaken by a local government with a population of one hundred ninety thousand persons or more <strong>at the time of designation</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
