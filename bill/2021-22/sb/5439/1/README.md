# Senate Bill 5439

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5439.xml)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that:
(a) Increasing broadband access to unserved areas of the state provides a public benefit to the citizens of Washington by allowing full participation in society and the modern economy, and enabling access to health care, education, and essential services, including public safety;
(b) Achieving affordable and quality broadband access for all Washingtonians will require sustained investment, research, local and community participation, and partnerships between private, public, and nonprofit entities;
(c) Providing for additional coordination across sectors to increase broadband access in unserved areas is in the best interest of the state; and
(d) Expanding broadband access, especially broadband conduit along roadways, provides commensurate benefits to the transportation system and motor vehicle users in terms of reducing congestion by allowing for more telework, and laying the foundation for a transportation system increasingly more reliant on autonomous vehicles.
(2) Therefore, the legislature intends to expand broadband access to unserved areas throughout the state by increasing broadband infrastructure coordination opportunities, including a registry for broadband infrastructure projects, allowing installation of infrastructure during state road construction projects, and further mapping of broadband deployment locations.

## Section 6
> This section modifies existing section [47.04.045](/rcw/47_public_highways_and_transportation/47.04_general_provisions.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/47_public_highways_and_transportation/47.04_general_provisions.md) for context.

1. For the purposes of this section:

    a. **"Broadband conduit" means a conduit used to support broadband infrastructure, including fiber optic cables.**

    b. "Right-of-way" means all state-owned land within a state highway corridor.

    c. "Service provider" means every corporation, company, association, joint stock association, firm, partnership, or person that owns, operates, or manages any personal wireless service facility **or broadband conduit**. "Service provider" includes a service provider's contractors, subcontractors, and legal successors.

2. [Empty]

    a. **Prior to construction of any road construction project that breaks ground or pavement, the department shall provide at least a 60-day notice by website or electronic subscription service to service providers operating within the same county or counties so that the department and service providers can proactively collaborate on the installation of personal wireless service facilities and broadband conduit during road construction projects. This focus on communication and coordination will align infrastructure needs, and help more Washingtonians achieve affordable and quality telecommunications and broadband access.**

    b. **If a service provider responds to the department's notice within 30 days, the department may schedule a consultation meeting with the service provider to review installation opportunities.**

    c. **The department may determine the feasibility and viability of any collaboration project and is under no duty to provide for installation.**

3. The department shall establish a process for issuing a lease for the use of the right-of-way by a service provider and shall require that telecommunications equipment be colocated on the same structure whenever practicable. Consistent with federal highway administration approval, the lease must include the right of direct ingress and egress from the highway for construction and maintenance of the personal wireless service facility **or broadband conduit** during nonpeak hours if public safety is not adversely affected. Direct ingress and egress may be allowed at any time for the construction of the facility **or conduit** if public safety is not adversely affected and if construction will not substantially interfere with traffic flow during peak traffic periods. The lease may specify an indirect ingress and egress to the facility **or conduit** if it is reasonable and available for the particular location.

4. The cost of the lease must be limited to the fair market value of the portion of the right-of-way being used by the service provider and the direct administrative expenses incurred by the department in processing the lease application.

If the department and the service provider are unable to agree on the cost of the lease, the service provider may submit the cost of the lease to binding arbitration by serving written notice on the department. Within thirty days of receiving the notice, each party shall furnish a list of acceptable arbitrators. The parties shall select an arbitrator; failing to agree on an arbitrator, each party shall select one arbitrator and the two arbitrators shall select a third arbitrator for an arbitration panel. The arbitrator or panel shall determine the cost of the lease based on comparable siting agreements. Costs of the arbitration, including compensation for the arbitrator's services, must be borne equally by the parties participating in the arbitration and each party shall bear its own costs and expenses, including legal fees and witness expenses, in connection with the arbitration proceeding.

5. The department shall act on an application for a lease within sixty days of receiving a completed application, unless a service provider consents to a different time period.

6. The reasons for a denial of a lease application must be supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.

7. The department may adopt rules to implement this section.

8. All lease money paid to the department under this section shall be deposited in the motor vehicle fund created in RCW 46.68.070.


## Section 8
> This section modifies existing section [47.04.047](/rcw/47_public_highways_and_transportation/47.04_general_provisions.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/47_public_highways_and_transportation/47.04_general_provisions.md) for context.

Personal wireless service **and broadband service are** critical **parts** of the state's infrastructure. The rapid deployment of personal wireless service facilities **and broadband infrastructure are** critical to ensure public safety, network access, quality of service, and rural economic development.

It is the declared policy of this state to assure that the use of rights-of-way of state highways accommodate the deployment of personal wireless service facilities **and broadband infrastructure** consistent with highway safety and the preservation of the public investment in state highway facilities.


## Section 9
> This section modifies existing section [47.44.081](/rcw/47_public_highways_and_transportation/47.44_franchises_on_state_highways.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/47_public_highways_and_transportation/47.44_franchises_on_state_highways.md) for context.

This chapter does not apply to leases issued for the deployment of personal wireless service facilities **or broadband infrastructure** as provided in RCW 47.04.045.


## Section 10
> This section modifies existing section [47.52.001](/rcw/47_public_highways_and_transportation/47.52_limited_access_facilities.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/47_public_highways_and_transportation/47.52_limited_access_facilities.md) for context.

1. Unrestricted access to and from public highways has resulted in congestion and peril for the traveler. It has caused undue slowing of all traffic in many areas. The investment of the public in highway facilities has been impaired and highway facilities costing vast sums of money will have to be relocated and reconstructed.

2. Personal wireless service **and broadband service are** critical **parts** of the state's infrastructure. The rapid deployment of personal wireless service facilities **and broadband infrastructure are** critical to ensure public safety, network access, quality of service, and rural economic development.

3. It is, therefore, the declared policy of this state to limit access to the highway facilities of this state in the interest of highway safety and for the preservation of the investment of the public in such facilities, and to assure that the use of rights-of-way of limited access facilities accommodate the deployment of personal wireless service facilities **and broadband infrastructure** consistent with these interests.
