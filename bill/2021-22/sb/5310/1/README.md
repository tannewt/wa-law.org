# Senate Bill 5310

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5310.xml)
## Section 1
This act may be known and cited as the combatting violence, disorder, and looting and law enforcement protection act.


## Section 2
The legislature finds that government exists, in part, to secure rights and equal justice for all citizens, while at the same time maintain social order. Statutory and common law vests in the state the police powers essential to the preservation of social order, which it has delegated to local governments. For example, in Chicago v. Sturges, 222 U.S. 313 (1911), the United States supreme court held that liability may exist when a local government fails to protect property destroyed by unpeaceful protests, riots, or mob violence. The legislature intends to hold local governments responsible when they willfully fail to discharge their delegated power to maintain social order. The legislature further finds that law enforcement officers and first responders are vital public servants who put their lives at risk for the betterment of their community and that intentionally withdrawing or reducing these services leads to increases in violent crime and decreases in overall public safety.


## Section 3

3. **Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person convicted of assaulting a law enforcement officer in furtherance of a riot or unlawful assembly prohibited under chapter 9A.84 RCW must be sentenced to a minimum term of total confinement of 180 days.**


## Section 4
> This section modifies existing section [9A.46.020](/rcw/09A_washington_criminal_code/9A.46_harassment.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/09A_washington_criminal_code/9A.46_harassment.md) for context.

1. A person is guilty of harassment if:

2. [Empty]

    a. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, a person who harasses another is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.

    b. A person who harasses another is guilty of a class C felony if any of the following apply: (i) The person has previously been convicted in this or any other state of any crime of harassment, as defined in RCW 9A.46.060, of the same victim or members of the victim's family or household or any person specifically named in a no-contact or no-harassment order; (ii) the person harasses another person under subsection (1)(a)(i) of this section by threatening to kill the person threatened or any other person; (iii) the person harasses a criminal justice participant who is performing his or her official duties at the time the threat is made;  (iv) the person harasses a criminal justice participant because of an action taken or decision made by the criminal justice participant during the performance of his or her official duties**; or (v)(A) the person would not be capable of harassing another person unless the person crossed state lines within the previous 10 days; and (B) the harassment occurs in a place of public accommodation or private residence**. For the purposes of (b)(iii) and (iv) of this subsection, the fear from the threat must be a fear that a reasonable criminal justice participant would have under all the circumstances. Threatening words do not constitute harassment if it is apparent to the criminal justice participant that the person does not have the present and future ability to carry out the threat.

3. Any criminal justice participant who is a target for threats or harassment prohibited under subsection (2)(b)(iii) or (iv) of this section, and any family members residing with him or her, shall be eligible for the address confidentiality program created under RCW 40.24.030.

1. The county criminal justice assistance account is created in the state treasury. Beginning in fiscal year 2000, the state treasurer must transfer into the county criminal justice assistance account from the general fund the sum of twenty-three million two hundred thousand dollars divided into four equal deposits occurring on July 1, October 1, January 1, and April 1. For each fiscal year thereafter, the state treasurer must increase the total transfer by the fiscal growth factor, as defined in RCW 43.135.025, forecast for that fiscal year by the office of financial management in November of the preceding year.

2. The moneys deposited in the county criminal justice assistance account for distribution under this section, less any moneys appropriated for purposes under subsections (4) and (5) of this section, must be distributed at such times as distributions are made under RCW 82.44.150 and on the relative basis of each county's funding factor as determined under this subsection.

    a. A county's funding factor is the sum of:

        i. The population of the county, divided by one thousand, and multiplied by two-tenths;

        ii. The crime rate of the county, multiplied by three-tenths; and

        iii. The annual number of criminal cases filed in the county superior court, for each one thousand in population, multiplied by five-tenths.

    b. Under this section and RCW 82.14.320 and 82.14.330:

        i. The population of the county or city is as last determined by the office of financial management;

        ii. The crime rate of the county or city is the annual occurrence of specified criminal offenses, as calculated in the most recent annual report on crime in Washington state as published by the Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs, for each one thousand in population;

        iii. The annual number of criminal cases filed in the county superior court must be determined by the most recent annual report of the courts of Washington, as published by the administrative office of the courts;

        iv. Distributions and eligibility for distributions in the 1989-1991 biennium must be based on 1988 figures for both the crime rate as described under (ii) of this subsection and the annual number of criminal cases that are filed as described under (iii) of this subsection. Future distributions must be based on the most recent figures for both the crime rate as described under (ii) of this subsection and the annual number of criminal cases that are filed as described under (iii) of this subsection.

3. Moneys distributed under this section must be expended exclusively for criminal justice purposes and may not be used to replace or supplant existing funding.

Calendar year 1989 actual operating expenditures for criminal justice purposes exclude the following: Expenditures for extraordinary events not likely to reoccur, changes in contract provisions for criminal justice services, beyond the control of the local jurisdiction receiving the services, and major nonrecurring capital expenditures.

4. Not more than five percent of the funds deposited to the county criminal justice assistance account may be available for appropriations for enhancements to the state patrol crime laboratory system and the continuing costs related to these enhancements. Funds appropriated from this account for such enhancements may not supplant existing funds from the state general fund.

5. During the 2017-2019 fiscal biennium, the sum of one hundred fifty-three thousand dollars, and during the 2019-2021 fiscal biennium, the sum of five hundred ten thousand dollars, may be appropriated for the Washington state patrol to provide investigative assistance and report services to assist local law enforcement agencies to prosecute criminals. It is the intent of the legislature that this policy will be continued in subsequent fiscal biennia.

6. **If a county is found, based on a valid judicial finding or legislative determination, to be in violation of section 14 of this act, the county shall lose one-half of its share of the county criminal justice assistance account for up to one year, to begin at the commencement of the next fiscal year, or until its services are brought into compliance.**

7. **If a county with a population greater than 30,000 inhabitants is found, based on a valid judicial finding or legislative determination, to have intentionally set or maintained a law enforcement-to-inhabitant ratio of a less than one full-time law enforcement officer per 1,000 inhabitants, in violation of section 15 of this act, the county shall lose up to one-half of its share of the county criminal justice assistance account for up to one year, to begin at the commencement of the fiscal year, or until services are brought into compliance.**

6. Moneys distributed under this section must be expended exclusively for criminal justice purposes and may not be used to replace or supplant existing funding.
