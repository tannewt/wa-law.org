<p>This act may be known and cited as the combatting violence, disorder, and looting and law enforcement protection act.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-395">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-395">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that government exists, in part, to secure rights and equal justice for all citizens, while at the same time maintain social order. Statutory and common law vests in the state the police powers essential to the preservation of social order, which it has delegated to local governments. For example, in Chicago v. Sturges, 222 U.S. 313 (1911), the United States supreme court held that liability may exist when a local government fails to protect property destroyed by unpeaceful protests, riots, or mob violence. The legislature intends to hold local governments responsible when they willfully fail to discharge their delegated power to maintain social order. The legislature further finds that law enforcement officers and first responders are vital public servants who put their lives at risk for the betterment of their community and that intentionally withdrawing or reducing these services leads to increases in violent crime and decreases in overall public safety.</p>

<p>The county criminal justice assistance account is created in the state treasury. Beginning in fiscal year 2000, the state treasurer must transfer into the county criminal justice assistance account from the general fund the sum of twenty-three million two hundred thousand dollars divided into four equal deposits occurring on July 1, October 1, January 1, and April 1. For each fiscal year thereafter, the state treasurer must increase the total transfer by the fiscal growth factor, as defined in RCW 43.135.025, forecast for that fiscal year by the office of financial management in November of the preceding year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The moneys deposited in the county criminal justice assistance account for distribution under this section, less any moneys appropriated for purposes under subsections (4) and (5) of this section, must be distributed at such times as distributions are made under RCW 82.44.150 and on the relative basis of each county's funding factor as determined under this subsection.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A county's funding factor is the sum of:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The population of the county, divided by one thousand, and multiplied by two-tenths;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The crime rate of the county, multiplied by three-tenths; and</p>

<li>
<p>The annual number of criminal cases filed in the county superior court, for each one thousand in population, multiplied by five-tenths.</p>

<li>
<p>Under this section and RCW 82.14.320 and 82.14.330:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The population of the county or city is as last determined by the office of financial management;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The annual number of criminal cases filed in the county superior court must be determined by the most recent annual report of the courts of Washington, as published by the administrative office of the courts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distributions and eligibility for distributions in the 1989-1991 biennium must be based on 1988 figures for both the crime rate as described under (ii) of this subsection and the annual number of criminal cases that are filed as described under (iii) of this subsection. Future distributions must be based on the most recent figures for both the crime rate as described under (ii) of this subsection and the annual number of criminal cases that are filed as described under (iii) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moneys distributed under this section must be expended exclusively for criminal justice purposes and may not be used to replace or supplant existing funding. Criminal justice purposes are defined as activities that substantially assist the criminal justice system, which may include circumstances where ancillary benefit to the civil or juvenile justice system occurs, and which includes (a) domestic violence services such as those provided by domestic violence programs, community advocates, and legal advocates, as defined in RCW 70.123.020, and (b) during the 2001-2003 fiscal biennium, juvenile dispositional hearings relating to petitions for at-risk youth, truancy, and children in need of services. Existing funding for purposes of this subsection is defined as calendar year 1989 actual operating expenditures for criminal justice purposes. Calendar year 1989 actual operating expenditures for criminal justice purposes exclude the following: Expenditures for extraordinary events not likely to reoccur, changes in contract provisions for criminal justice services, beyond the control of the local jurisdiction receiving the services, and major nonrecurring capital expenditures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not more than five percent of the funds deposited to the county criminal justice assistance account may be available for appropriations for enhancements to the state patrol crime laboratory system and the continuing costs related to these enhancements. Funds appropriated from this account for such enhancements may not supplant existing funds from the state general fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the 2017-2019 fiscal biennium, the sum of one hundred fifty-three thousand dollars, and during the 2019-2021 fiscal biennium, the sum of five hundred ten thousand dollars, may be appropriated for the Washington state patrol to provide investigative assistance and report services to assist local law enforcement agencies to prosecute criminals. It is the intent of the legislature that this policy will be continued in subsequent fiscal biennia.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>If a county is found, based on a valid judicial finding or legislative determination, to be in violation of section 14 of this act, the county shall lose one-half of its share of the county criminal justice assistance account for up to one year, to begin at the commencement of the next fiscal year, or until its services are brought into compliance.</strong></p>

For each fiscal year thereafter, the state treasurer must increase the total transfer by the fiscal growth factor, as defined in RCW 43.135.025, forecast for that fiscal year by the office of financial management in November of the preceding year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No city may receive a distribution under this section from the municipal criminal justice assistance account unless:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The city has a crime rate in excess of one hundred twenty-five percent of the statewide average as calculated in the most recent annual report on crime in Washington state as published by the Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The city has levied the tax authorized in RCW 82.14.030(2) at the maximum rate or the tax authorized in RCW 82.46.010(3) at the maximum rate; and</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The moneys deposited in the municipal criminal justice assistance account for distribution under this section, less any moneys appropriated for purposes under subsection (7) of this section, must be distributed at such times as distributions are made under RCW 82.44.150. The distributions must be made as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Unless reduced by this subsection, thirty percent of the moneys must be distributed ratably based on population as last determined by the office of financial management to those cities eligible under subsection (2) of this section that have a crime rate determined under subsection (2)(a) of this section which is greater than one hundred seventy-five percent of the statewide average crime rate. No city may receive more than fifty percent of any moneys distributed under this subsection (a) but, if a city distribution is reduced as a result of exceeding the fifty percent limitation, the amount not distributed must be distributed under (b) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The remainder of the moneys, including any moneys not distributed in subsection (2)(a) of this section, must be distributed to all cities eligible under subsection (2) of this section ratably based on population as last determined by the office of financial management.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>No city may receive more than thirty percent of all moneys distributed under subsection (3) of this section.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Moneys distributed under this section must be expended exclusively for criminal justice purposes and may not be used to replace or supplant existing funding. Criminal justice purposes are defined as activities that substantially assist the criminal justice system, which may include circumstances where ancillary benefit to the civil justice system occurs, and which includes domestic violence services such as those provided by domestic violence programs, community advocates, and legal advocates, as defined in RCW 70.123.020, and publications and public educational efforts designed to provide information and assistance to parents in dealing with runaway or at-risk youth. Existing funding for purposes of this subsection is defined as calendar year 1989 actual operating expenditures for criminal justice purposes. Calendar year 1989 actual operating expenditures for criminal justice purposes exclude the following: Expenditures for extraordinary events not likely to reoccur, changes in contract provisions for criminal justice services, beyond the control of the local jurisdiction receiving the services, and major nonrecurring capital expenditures.</p>

<p><strong>If a city is found, based on a valid judicial finding or legislative determination, to be in violation of section 12 of this act, the city shall lose one-half of its share of the municipal criminal justice assistance account for one year, to begin at the commencement of the next fiscal year, or until its services are brought into compliance.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If a city with a population greater than 50,000 inhabitants is found, based on a valid judicial finding or legislative determination, to have intentionally set or maintained a law enforcement-to-inhabitant ratio of a less than one full-time law enforcement officer per 1,000 inhabitants, in violation of section 13 of this act, the city shall lose up to one-half of its share of the municipal criminal justice assistance account for up to one year, to begin at the commencement of the fiscal year, or until services are brought into compliance.</strong></p>
