</li>
<li>
<p>The establishment of exemptions from the marking or tagging requirements of RCW 19.94.250 with respect to weighing or measuring instruments or devices of such a character or size that the marking or tagging would be inappropriate, impracticable, or damaging to the apparatus in question;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The establishment of exemptions from the inspection and testing requirements of RCW 19.94.163 with respect to classes of weighing or measuring instruments or devices found to be of such a character that periodic inspection and testing is unnecessary to ensure continued accuracy;</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rules adopted under this section must also include specifications and tolerances for the acceptable range of accuracy required of weighing or measuring instruments or devices and must be designed to eliminate from use, without prejudice to weighing or measuring instruments or devices that conform as closely as practicable to official specifications and tolerances, those that: (a) Are of such construction that they are faulty, that is, that are not reasonably permanent in their adjustment or will not repeat their indications correctly; or (b) facilitate the perpetration of fraud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rules adopted by the director related to the sale of electricity sold as a vehicle fuel and electric vehicle fueling systems may be modified to achieve state objectives, reviewed, and, if necessary, amended, to maintain consistency with evolving technology. These rules may take effect no earlier than January 1, 2024. To ensure existing infrastructure may continue operating without substantial equipment replacement or alteration, electric vehicle supply equipment installed and placed into service before January 1, 2024, is exempt from the rules of this section until January 1, 2034. Electric vehicle supply equipment that is replaced or retrofitted with new hardware after January 1, 2024, must be considered as having been installed and placed into service after January 1, 2024.</strong></p>
