Immediately below the lettering identifying the public entity and agency operating the vehicle or below an approved insignia shall appear the words &quot;for official use only&quot; in letters at least one inch high in a color contrasting with the color of the vehicle. The appropriate governing body may provide by rule or ordinance for marking of passenger motor vehicles as prescribed in subsection (2) of this section or for exceptions to the marking requirements for local governmental agencies for the same purposes and under the same circumstances as permitted for state agencies under subsection (3) of this section.</p>

Markings must be on a transparent adhesive material and conform to the standards established by the department of enterprise services.

<p>The director of the department of enterprise services shall establish equitable and consistent parking rental fees for the capitol campus and may, if requested by agencies, establish equitable and consistent parking rental fees for agencies off the capitol campus, to be charged to employees, visitors, clients, service providers, and others, that reflect the legislature's intent to reduce state subsidization of parking or to meet the commute trip reduction goals established in *RCW 70.94.527. All fees shall take into account the market rate of comparable privately owned rental parking, as determined by the director. However, parking rental fees are not to exceed the local market rate of comparable privately owned rental parking.</p>
