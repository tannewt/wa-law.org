# Second Substitute Senate Bill 5188 as Recommended by Ways & Means

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5188-S2.xml)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that there exists in the state of Washington billions of dollars of critical local projects for the planning, acquisition, construction, repair, replacement, rehabilitation, or improvement of streets and roads, bridges, water systems, storm and sanitary sewage systems, solid waste handling, communications systems, housing, and other public infrastructure and economic development projects. But while some local governments successfully borrow for infrastructure and economic development capital projects through private sector lenders and the bond markets, other government entities do not have the same access to capital at attractive rates to be used in building out public infrastructure.
It is the policy of the state of Washington to encourage self-reliance by local and tribal governments in meeting their public works and economic development needs, and to assist in the financing of critical public works and economic development projects by providing effective mechanisms for making and financing loans and providing financing guarantees that do not create state debt. It is also the policy of the state to provide technical assistance to government entities for these projects.
It is further the policy of the state to foster and promote by all reasonable means the provision of adequate capital markets and facilities for borrowing money by local governments in the state to finance infrastructure improvements, and to the greatest extent possible to reduce costs of borrowed money to taxpayers and residents of the state.
The legislature finds that a Washington state public financial cooperative would provide opportunities for local and tribal government entities to competitively finance a broad array of public infrastructure and economic development projects, including housing, at competitive rates with low administrative costs. A state public financial cooperative will complement the existing banking system by filling gaps that the system cannot or will not fill, and it will be uniquely positioned to provide specialized technical assistance to the diverse needs of local and tribal government entities.
It is the purpose of this chapter to establish a Washington state public financial cooperative to act as a financial conduit that, without creating state debt, can receive funds from state, local, and tribal government entities, issue and make loans to those entities, and issue bonds in a manner that does not create state debt, to help facilitate access to needed capital by local and tribal government entities on reasonable terms and rates.
The state public financial cooperative will have full powers to borrow money and to issue its bonds and notes in a manner that does not create state debt in order to make capital funds available for borrowing by local and tribal government entities, and those powers will enable the state public financial cooperative to carry out the declared policies of this act, which are in the public interest of the state and its taxpayers and residents.

Such funds are not public moneys or funds of the state of Washington and at all times must be kept segregated and set apart from other funds.
(2) Bonds issued under this chapter must contain a recital on their face to the effect that payment of the principal of, interest on, and prepayment premium, if any, on the bonds, is a valid claim only as against the special fund or funds relating thereto, that neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the state or any municipal corporation, subdivision, or agency of the state, other than the cooperative as set forth in this chapter, is pledged to the payment of the principal of, interest on, and prepayment premium, if any, on the bonds. Contracts entered into by the cooperative must be entered into in the name of the cooperative and not in the name of the state of Washington.

(5) Any bonds issued under this chapter may be secured by a financing document between the cooperative and the purchasers or owners of such bonds or between the cooperative and a corporate trustee appointed by the cooperative, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. The financing document may pledge or assign, in whole or in part, the revenues and funds held or to be received by the cooperative, any present or future contract or other rights to receive the same, and the proceeds thereof.

(8) When issuing bonds, the cooperative may provide for the future issuance of additional bonds or parity debt on a parity with outstanding bonds, and the terms and conditions of their issuance. The cooperative may refund or advance refund any bond of the cooperative in accordance with chapter 39.53 RCW or issue bonds with a subordinate lien against the fund or funds securing outstanding bonds. Bonds issued for refunding purposes may be combined with bonds issued for the financing or refinancing of new projects. Pending the application of the proceeds of the refunding bonds to the redemption of the bonds to be redeemed, the cooperative may enter into an agreement or agreements with a corporate trustee regarding the interim investment of the proceeds and the application of the proceeds and the earnings on the proceeds to the payment of the principal of and interest on, and the redemption of, the bonds to be redeemed.
(9) All money received by or on behalf of the cooperative with respect to this issuance of its bonds are trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this chapter.

(13) The cooperative may, out of any fund available therefor, purchase its bonds in the open market.
(14) Any owner of bonds of the cooperative issued under this chapter, and the trustee under any trust agreement or indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceeding, protect and enforce any of their respective rights, and may become the purchaser at any foreclosure sale if the person is the highest bidder, except to the extent the rights given are restricted by the cooperative in any bond resolution or trust agreement or indenture authorizing the issuance of the bonds.
(15) The cooperative may charge for its costs and services in review or consideration of a proposed loan to a state, local, or tribal government, whether or not the loan is made.
(16) To the extent permitted under its contracts with the owners of bonds of the cooperative, the cooperative may consent to modification of the rate of interest, time and payment of installment of principal or interest, security, or any other term of a bond or note, loan to a state, local, or tribal government, contract, or agreement of any kind to which the cooperative authority is a party.
(17) The bonds of the cooperative are securities in which all public officers and bodies of this state and all counties, cities, municipal corporations, and political subdivisions, all banks, eligible banking organizations, bankers, trust companies, savings banks and institutions, building and loan associations, savings and loan associations, investment companies, insurance companies and associations, and all executors, administrators, guardians, trustees, and other fiduciaries may legally invest any sinking funds, moneys, or other funds belonging to them or within their control.
(18) This section provides a complete, additional, and alternative method for accomplishing the purposes of this chapter and shall be regarded as supplemental and additional to powers conferred by other laws. The issuance of bonds and refunding bonds under this chapter need not comply with the requirements of any other law applicable to the issuance of bonds. Insofar as the provisions of this chapter are inconsistent with the provisions of any general or special law, or parts thereof, the provisions of this chapter are controlling.
