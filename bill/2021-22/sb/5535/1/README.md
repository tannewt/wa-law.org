# Senate Bill 5535

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5535.xml)
## Section 1
The purpose of this act is to repeal RCW 13.40.220, also known as the "parent pay" statute, which requires parents to pay a percentage of their gross income to the department of children, youth, and families for the cost of their child's support, treatment, and confinement in the department's juvenile rehabilitation residential facilities.

The parent pay statute essentially operates as a legal financial obligation assessed on parents for their child's incarceration. It disproportionally impacts poorer parents and represents a dated policy and philosophy that is not aligned with current racial equity and social justice reforms. Pursuing these parents is unfair and takes advantage of people at their most vulnerable, undermining government credibility and the integrity of the legal process. Placing these parents in debt may also result in unstable home environments, deterring successful youth reentry back into the community.

The legislature finds that eliminating parents' financial obligation to pay for their child's incarceration will advance racial equity and help to support a successful transition to adulthood for young people in the department's care.


## Section 3
> This section modifies existing section [43.20B.095](/rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.020B_revenue_recovery_for_department_of_social_and_health_services.md).
