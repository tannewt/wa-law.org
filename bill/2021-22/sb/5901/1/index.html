<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that there are counties in the state that face additional economic development challenges beyond the challenges faced by counties located in the central Puget Sound region. The legislature further finds that these regions do not experience the same degree of job growth and investment. The legislature further finds that, in some areas, increased economic development incentives are needed to help support economic growth and that a one-size-fits-all approach to economic development does not work for the diversity of the statewide economy. For these reasons, the legislature intends to establish a tax deferral program to be effective solely in certain targeted counties. The legislature declares that this limited program serves the vital public purpose of creating employment opportunities and generally spurring economic development in these counties of the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that this act is consistent with the Substitute House Bill No. 1170, the Washington BEST manufacturing act, enacted in 2021. The 2021 Washington BEST manufacturing act recognized that the state must retain and build on its leadership in the manufacturing and research and development sectors and also recognized that a thriving manufacturing and research sector are complimentary and should be promoted in every region of the state. Therefore, the legislature further finds the sales and use tax deferral program for manufacturing and research and development in this act is a critical tool and strategy to help achieve the goals expressed in the Washington BEST manufacturing act of doubling the state's manufacturing employment base, the number of small businesses, and the number of women and minority-owned manufacturing businesses in the next 10 years.</p>

<h2 id="section-203-22">Section 203 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-203-22">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This section is the tax preference performance statement for the warehousing, distribution, and grain elevator sales and use tax exemptions in sections 201 and 202, chapter . . ., Laws of 2022 (sections 201 and 202 of this act). The performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature categorizes this tax preference as one intended to accomplish the general purposes indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2) (a) and (c) to induce certain designated behavior by businesses and to create jobs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to induce the construction of new or expanded warehouses and distribution centers in certain targeted counties by reducing the square footage requirement in order to diversify the tax base and increase employment within the targeted counties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To measure the effectiveness of these exemptions in achieving the specific public policy objectives described in subsection (3) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee must evaluate the changes in the number of employment positions in the warehousing and distribution industry sector in the targeted counties and changes to the tax base as a result of increased warehousing and distribution activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may refer to the remittance data prepared by the department of revenue and the annual tax preference performance report submitted by the beneficiary of the tax preference under RCW 82.32.534. A person claiming an exemption from state tax in the form of a remittance under RCW 82.08.820 or 82.12.820 for a warehouse or distribution center must file the annual tax preference performance report under RCW 82.32.534 beginning in the first calendar year following the year the warehouse or distribution center is operationally complete and for the next two subsequent years.</p>
