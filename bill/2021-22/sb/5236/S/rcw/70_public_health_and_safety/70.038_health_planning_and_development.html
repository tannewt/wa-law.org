<p>It is declared to be the public policy of this state:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>That strategic health planning efforts must be supported by appropriately tailored regulatory activities that can effectuate the goals and principles of the statewide health resources strategy developed pursuant to chapter 43.370 RCW. The implementation of the strategy can promote, maintain, and assure the health of all citizens in the state, provide accessible health services, health manpower, health facilities, and other resources while controlling increases in costs, and recognize prevention as a high priority in health programs. Involvement in health planning from both consumers and providers throughout the state should be encouraged;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the certificate of need program is a component of a health planning regulatory process that is consistent with the statewide health resources strategy and public policy goals that are clearly articulated and regularly updated;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the development and maintenance of adequate health care information, statistics and projections of need for health facilities and services is essential to effective health planning and resources development;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the development of nonregulatory approaches to health care cost containment should be considered, including the strengthening of price competition; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That health planning should be concerned with public health and health care financing, access, and quality, recognizing their close interrelationship and emphasizing cost control of health services, including cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis.</p>

<p>The legislature recognizes that in this state ethnic minorities currently use nursing home care at a lower rate than the general population.

<p>The relative degree to which the long-term care needs of an ethnic minority are not otherwise being met;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The percentage of low-income persons who would be served by the proposed nursing home;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The financial feasibility of the proposed nursing home; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The impact of the proposal on the area's total need for nursing home beds.</p>

<li>
<p>Will be owned and operated by a nonprofit corporation, and at least fifty percent of the board of directors of the corporation are members of the ethnic minority the nursing home is intended to serve;</p>
