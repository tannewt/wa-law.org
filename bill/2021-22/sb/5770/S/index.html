<h2 id="section-1-203">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-203">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that conventions are an important part of the state's economy. Conventions create jobs, attract investment, directly support the hospitality and tourism industries, and improve the diversity and vibrancy of our communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that businesses dependent on conventions have suffered disproportionately from the COVID-19 pandemic and that grant funding is necessary to support and revitalize this industry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Establish a grant program to provide financial assistance to businesses that are dependent on the economic activity created through conventions hosted in Washington; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a financial contribution of $5 million dollars to fund the grant program for fiscal year 2023. This appropriation may be from either state funds or federal funds, or from any combination of both.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2-156">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-156">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This section adds a new section to an existing chapter <a href="/rcw/43_state_government%E2%80%94executive/43.330_department_of_commerce.html">43.330</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/43_state_government%E2%80%94executive/43.330_department_of_commerce.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>

</li>
