# Substitute Senate Bill 5259 as Recommended by Law & Justice

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5259-S.xml)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that law enforcement transparency and accountability are vital in maintaining public trust. Data collection is one essential tool to allow the public, law enforcement, and policymakers to analyze the effectiveness of existing police practices, determine which policies and training work and do not work, and avoid unintended consequences by supporting policy decisions with clear and relevant data.
The legislature finds that creating a statewide data collection program that creates a publicly accessible database to track metrics will help to promote openness, transparency, and accountability, build stronger police-community relations, improve trust and confidence in policing services, evaluate specific areas of concern such as biased policing and excessive force, and ultimately improve the quality of policing services. 

## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.
(1) "Great bodily harm" has the same meaning as in RCW 9A.04.110.
(2) "Law enforcement agency" includes any "general authority Washington law enforcement agency" and "limited authority Washington law enforcement agency" as those terms are defined in RCW 10.93.020.

(4) "University" means a four-year institution of higher education.
