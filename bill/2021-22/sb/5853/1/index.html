<p>In order to remedy past impacts to historically marginalized populations within impacted local communities resulting from the construction of Interstate 90 and the US 395 North Spokane Corridor project, the department may establish a limited project for community purposes under the provisions of this section. It is the intent of the legislature that the department establish the project to allow the affected property to be used for community purposes made unavailable due to the placement of the highway, and therefore the department is strongly encouraged to establish the project.</p>

<li>
<p>Pursuant to RCW 47.12.120, the department may lease the property described in (b) of this subsection to the city of Spokane or to a community-based nonprofit corporation to be used for the following community purposes made unavailable due to the placement of the highway projects described in subsection (1) of this section:</p>

<p>The property eligible for lease under this section includes property that was purchased as part of the Interstate 90 corridor project and the US 395 North Spokane Corridor.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Any sublease resulting from this section is not intended to generate exorbitant profits.</p>
