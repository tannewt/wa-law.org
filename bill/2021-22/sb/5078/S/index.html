<h2 id="section-1-821">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-821">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds and declares that gun violence is a threat to the public health and safety of Washingtonians. Firearms equipped with large capacity magazines increase casualties by allowing a shooter to keep firing for longer periods of time without reloading. Large capacity magazines have been used in all 10 of the deadliest mass shootings since 2009, and mass shooting events from 2009 to 2018 where the use of large capacity magazines caused twice as many deaths and 14 times as many injuries. Documentary evidence following gun rampages, including the 2014 shooting at Seattle Pacific University, reveals many instances where victims were able to escape or disarm the shooter during a pause to reload, and such opportunities are necessarily reduced when large capacity magazines are used. In addition, firearms equipped with large capacity magazines account for an estimated 22 to 36 percent of crime guns and up to 40 percent of crime guns used in serious violent crimes. Based on this evidence, and on studies showing that mass shooting fatalities declined during the 10-year period when the federal assault weapon and large capacity magazine ban was in effect, the legislature finds that restricting large capacity magazines is likely to reduce gun deaths and injuries. The legislature further finds that this is a well-calibrated policy based on evidence that magazine capacity limits do not interfere with responsible, lawful self-defense, and data self-reported by the gun industry showing that the vast majority of handgun magazines hold 10 or fewer rounds. The legislature further finds that the threats to public safety posed by large capacity magazines are heightened given current conditions. Our country is in the midst of a pandemic, economic recession, social tensions, and reckonings over racial justice. The year 2020 has seen a sharp increase in gun sales and gun violence, as well as fears over gun violence and incidents of armed intimidation. In this volatile atmosphere, the legislature declares that it is time to enhance public health and safety by limiting the sale or transfer of large capacity magazines in Washington. The legislature acknowledges that in Duncan v. Becerra, the United States court of appeals for the ninth circuit court found that California's law creating a blanket ban on large capacity magazines was unconstitutional. The legislature does not intend to create a blanket ban, but only to limit the prospective sale or transfer of large capacity magazines, allowing existing legal owners to retain large capacity magazines for the purposes of defending themselves and their homes and using those large capacity magazines in other authorized locations. The legislature also finds that large capacity magazines holding in excess of 17 rounds of ammunition do not come standard when sold with firearms typically used for self-defense, but are dangerous and unusual.</p>
