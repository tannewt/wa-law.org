<h2 id="section-1-1159">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1159">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that encouraging economic development in rural areas is a compelling reason to amend the growth management act. Additionally, creating a path forward for cities and counties to collaboratively seek solutions to the complicated issues regarding annexation will enable the local jurisdictions to appropriately allocate development without competing for resources.</p>
<p>Asking local jurisdictions to thoughtfully examine the status of their local economy and its potential for growth moving forward has been agreed upon as an appropriate addition to any jurisdiction's comprehensive growth management plan. The legislature finds that economic development is an equally important value and goal within the growth management act and should be thoughtfully considered accordingly.</p>
<p>As the growth management act has evolved and grown over time, it has become a trap for smaller jurisdictions. Small, rural jurisdictions need a safe harbor and an ally to help them effectively plan for their futures while giving them space from the threat of impending litigation costs. The legislature finds that a voluntary, limited safe harbor with assistance from the state may provide that necessary space for small rural jurisdictions to be able to invest their limited funds into growing their community instead of continually defending it from well-meaning outsiders. Small jurisdictions, particularly, in this climate are struggling to decide how to spend their limited funds. Adding more planning requirements only stretches nonexistent dollars. Looking forward, until the legislature finds that funding for planning for growth is a priority, these jurisdictions should not be punished, but instead encouraged to continue their planning endeavors. As such, the smallest, poorest jurisdictions should be given time and space to plan without being burdened by the requirements necessary to their bigger, more prosperous colleagues. The legislature finds that the rural areas of the state are important to this state and, during these difficult times, it is important to enable rural areas to focus on their economic development and growth.</p>

<p>The following goals are adopted to guide the development and adoption of comprehensive plans and development regulations of those counties and cities that are required or choose to plan under RCW 36.70A.040. <strong>Any changes or additions to this chapter after December 2020 must only be mandatory two years after the requirement becomes state law if funding sufficient to cover the additional costs is specifically provided for those planning requirements by the state.</strong> The following goals are not listed in order of priority and shall be used exclusively for the purpose of guiding the development of comprehensive plans and development regulations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Urban growth. Encourage development in urban areas where adequate public facilities and services exist or can be provided in an efficient manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce sprawl. Reduce the inappropriate conversion of undeveloped land into sprawling, low-density development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transportation. Encourage efficient multimodal transportation systems that are based on regional priorities and coordinated with county and city comprehensive plans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Housing. Encourage the availability of affordable housing to all economic segments of the population of this state, promote a variety of residential densities and housing types, and encourage preservation of existing housing stock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Economic development. Encourage economic development throughout the state that is consistent with adopted comprehensive plans, promote economic opportunity for all citizens of this state, especially for unemployed and for disadvantaged persons, promote the retention and expansion of existing businesses and recruitment of new businesses, recognize regional differences impacting economic development opportunities, and encourage growth in areas experiencing insufficient economic growth, all within the capacities of the state's natural resources, public services, and public facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Property rights. Private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation having been made. The property rights of landowners shall be protected from arbitrary and discriminatory actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Permits. Applications for both state and local government permits should be processed in a timely and fair manner to ensure predictability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Natural resource industries. Maintain and enhance natural resource-based industries, including productive timber, agricultural, and fisheries industries. Encourage the conservation of productive forestlands and productive agricultural lands, and discourage incompatible uses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open space and recreation. Retain open space, enhance recreational opportunities, conserve fish and wildlife habitat, increase access to natural resource lands and water, and develop parks and recreation facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Environment. Protect the environment and enhance the state's high quality of life, including air and water quality, and the availability of water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Citizen participation and coordination. Encourage the involvement of citizens in the planning process and ensure coordination between communities and jurisdictions to reconcile conflicts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public facilities and services. Ensure that those public facilities and services necessary to support development shall be adequate to serve the development at the time the development is available for occupancy and use without decreasing current service levels below locally established minimum standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Historic preservation. Identify and encourage the preservation of lands, sites, and structures, that have historical or archaeological significance.</p>
