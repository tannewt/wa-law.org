<p>When the legislative body of a charter code city or noncharter code city shall determine that the best interests and general welfare of such city would be served by the annexation of unincorporated territory contiguous to such city, such legislative body may, by resolution, call for an election to be held to submit to the voters of such territory the proposal for annexation. The resolution shall, subject to RCW 35.02.170, describe the boundaries of the area to be annexed, state the number of voters residing therein as nearly as may be, and shall provide that said city will pay the cost of the annexation election. The resolution may require that there also be submitted to the electorate of the territory sought to be annexed a proposition that all property within the area annexed shall, upon annexation, be assessed and taxed at the same rate and on the same basis as the property of such annexing city is assessed and taxed to pay for all or any portion of the then-outstanding indebtedness of the city to which said area is annexed, which indebtedness has been approved by the voters, contracted for, or incurred prior to, or existing at, the date of annexation. Whenever such city has prepared and filed a proposed zoning regulation for the area to be annexed as provided for in RCW 35A.14.330 and 35A.14.340, the resolution initiating the election may also provide for the simultaneous adoption of the proposed zoning regulation upon approval of annexation by the electorate of the area to be annexed. A certified copy of the resolution shall be filed with the legislative authority of the county in which said territory is located. A certified copy of the resolution shall be filed with the boundary review board as provided for in chapter 36.93 RCW or the county annexation review board established by RCW 35A.14.200, unless such annexation proposal is within the provisions of RCW 35A.14.220.</p>

<p>When a petition is sufficient under the rules set forth in RCW 35A.01.040, calling for an election to vote upon the annexation of unincorporated territory contiguous to a code city, describing the boundaries of the area proposed to be annexed, stating the number of voters therein as nearly as may be, and signed by qualified electors resident in such territory equal in number to ten percent of the votes cast at the last state general election therein, it shall be filed with the auditor of the county in which all, or the greatest portion, of the territory is located, and a copy of the petition shall be filed with the legislative body of the code city. If the territory is located in more than a single county, the auditor of the county with whom the petition is filed shall act as the lead auditor and transmit a copy of the petition to the auditor of each other county within which a portion of the territory is located. The auditor or auditors shall examine the petition, and the auditor or lead auditor shall certify the sufficiency of the petition to the legislative authority of the code city.</p>
<p>If the signatures on the petition are certified as containing sufficient valid signatures, the city legislative authority shall, by resolution entered within sixty days thereafter, notify the petitioners, either by mail or by publication in the same manner notice of hearing is required by RCW 35A.14.040 to be published, of its approval or rejection of the proposed action. In approving the proposed action, the legislative body may require that there also be submitted to the electorate of the territory to be annexed, a proposition that all property within the area to be annexed shall, upon annexation, be assessed and taxed at the same rate and on the same basis as the property of such annexing city is assessed and taxed to pay for all or any portion of the then-outstanding indebtedness of the city to which said area is annexed, which indebtedness has been approved by the voters, contracted for, or incurred prior to, or existing at, the date of annexation. Only after the legislative body has completed preparation and filing of a proposed zoning regulation for the area to be annexed as provided for in RCW 35A.14.330 and 35A.14.340, the legislative body in approving the proposed action, may require that the proposed zoning regulation be simultaneously adopted upon the approval of annexation by the electorate of the area to be annexed. The approval of the legislative body shall be a condition precedent to further proceedings upon the petition. The costs of conducting the election called for in the petition shall be a charge against the city concerned. The proposition or questions provided for in this section may be submitted to the voter either separately or as a single proposition.</p>

<p>Proceedings for initiating annexation of unincorporated territory to a charter code city or noncharter code city may be commenced by the filing of a petition of property owners of the territory proposed to be annexed, in the following manner. This method of annexation shall be alternative to other methods provided in this chapter. Prior to the circulation of a petition for annexation, the initiating party or parties, who shall be the owners of not less than ten percent in value, according to the assessed valuation for general taxation of the property for which annexation is sought, shall notify the legislative body of the code city in writing of their intention to commence annexation proceedings. The legislative body shall set a date, not later than sixty days after the filing of the request, for a meeting with the initiating parties to determine whether the code city will accept, reject, or geographically modify the proposed annexation, whether it shall require the simultaneous adoption of a proposed zoning regulation, if such a proposal has been prepared and filed for the area to be annexed as provided for in RCW 35A.14.330 and 35A.14.340, and whether it shall require the assumption of all or of any portion of existing city indebtedness by the area to be annexed. If the legislative body requires the assumption of all or of any portion of indebtedness and/or the adoption of a proposed zoning regulation, it shall record this action in its minutes and the petition for annexation shall be so drawn as to clearly indicate these facts. Approval by the legislative body shall be a condition precedent to circulation of the petition. There shall be no appeal from the decision of the legislative body. A petition for annexation of an area contiguous to a code city may be filed with the legislative body of the municipality to which annexation is desired. It must be signed by the owners, as defined by RCW 35A.01.040(9) (a) through (d), of not less than sixty percent in value, according to the assessed valuation for general taxation of the property for which annexation is petitioned: PROVIDED, That a petition for annexation of an area having at least eighty percent of the boundaries of such area contiguous with a portion of the boundaries of the code city, not including that portion of the boundary of the area proposed to be annexed that is coterminous with a portion of the boundary between two counties in this state, need be signed by only the owners of not less than fifty percent in value according to the assessed valuation for general taxation of the property for which the annexation is petitioned. Such petition shall set forth a description of the property according to government legal subdivisions or legal plats and shall be accompanied by a map which outlines the boundaries of the property sought to be annexed. If the legislative body has required the assumption of all or any portion of city indebtedness by the area annexed or the adoption of a proposed zoning regulation, these facts, together with a quotation of the minute entry of such requirement, or requirements, shall also be set forth in the petition.</p>

If a code city is proposing to annex territory where the sole access or majority of egress and ingress for the territory proposed for annexation is served by the transportation network of an adjacent city, or that will include areas in a fire protection district under Title 52 RCW, regional fire protection service authority under chapter 52.26 RCW, water-sewer district under Title 57 RCW, or transportation benefit district under chapter 36.73 RCW, the code city must provide written notice to the governing authority of such adjacent city, regional fire protection service authority, fire protection district, water-sewer district, or transportation benefit district. Such adjacent city or notified district shall have thirty calendar days from the date of the notice to provide written notice of its interest in being a party to the interlocal agreement. If timely notice is provided, such city or district shall be included as a party to the interlocal agreement. If the adjacent city or district does not approve the interlocal agreement, the annexation may not proceed under this section. For purposes of this subsection, &quot;adjacent&quot; means that the territory proposed for annexation is contiguous with the existing city limits of the nonannexing city. The interlocal agreement must ensure that for a period of five years after the annexation any parcel zoned for residential development within the annexed area shall:</p>

<li>
<p>Maintain a zoning designation that provides for residential development; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not have its minimum gross residential density reduced below the density allowed for by the zoning designation for that parcel prior to annexation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>

The interlocal agreement shall describe the boundaries of the territory to be annexed and set a date for a public hearing on such agreement for annexation. An interlocal agreement may include phased annexation of territory, and may be amended following the same process as initial approval, including adding additional territory. A public hearing shall be held by each legislative body, separately or jointly, before the agreement is executed. Each legislative body holding a public hearing shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Separately or jointly, publish a notice of availability of the agreement at least once a week for four weeks before the date of the hearing in one or more newspapers of general circulation within the code city and one or more newspapers of general circulation within the territory proposed for annexation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the legislative body has the ability to do so, post the notice of availability of the agreement on its website for the same four weeks that the notice is published in the newspapers under (a) of this subsection. The notice shall describe where the public may review the agreement and the territory to be annexed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the date set for hearing, the public shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard. Following the hearing, if the legislative body determines to effect the annexation, they shall do so by ordinance. If the annexation agreement includes phased annexation of territory, the legislative body shall adopt a separate ordinance at the time of each phase of annexation. Upon the date fixed in the ordinance of annexation the area annexed shall become part of the city. If the annexation ordinance provides for assumption of indebtedness or adoption of a proposed zoning regulation, the notice shall include a statement of such requirements. Upon passage of the annexation ordinance a certified copy shall be filed with the board of county commissioners of the county in which the annexed property is located.</p>

<p>A code city may annex an unincorporated area contiguous to the city that is owned by the federal government by adopting an ordinance providing for the annexation and which ordinance either acknowledges an agreement of the annexation by the government of the United States, or accepts a gift, grant, or lease from the government of the United States of the right to occupy, control, improve it or sublet it for commercial, manufacturing, or industrial purposes: PROVIDED, That this right of annexation shall not apply to any territory more than four miles from the corporate limits existing before such annexation. Whenever a code city proposes to annex territory under this section, the city shall provide written notice of the proposed annexation to the legislative authority of the county within which such territory is located. The notice shall be provided at least thirty days before the city proposes to adopt the annexation ordinance. The city shall not adopt the annexation ordinance, and the annexation shall not occur under this section, if within twenty-five days of receipt of the notice, the county legislative authority adopts a resolution opposing the annexation, which resolution makes a finding that the proposed annexation will have an adverse fiscal impact on the county or road district.</p>

<p>A code city as provided in RCW 35A.14.296(2) may collaborate with the county or counties where the code city is located to form an interlocal agreement regarding annexation of unincorporated territory within the urban growth area boundary. The interlocal agreement formation process must include procedures for public participation. The procedures must provide for broad dissemination of proposals and alternatives, opportunity for written comments, public meetings after effective notice, and consideration of and response to public comments. The interlocal agreement may only be executed after notice of availability of the agreement is posted on the website of each legislative body for four weeks and a public hearing by each legislative body, separately or jointly. This method of annexation shall be an alternative method and is additional to all other methods provided for in this chapter.</p>

<p>After an annexation by a code city, the utilities and transportation commission shall continue to regulate solid waste collection within the limits of the annexed territory until such time as the city notifies the commission, in writing, of its decision to contract for solid waste collection or provide solid waste collection itself pursuant to RCW 81.77.020. In the event the annexing city at any time decides to contract for solid waste collection or decides to undertake solid waste collection itself, the holder of any such franchise or permit that is so canceled in whole or in part shall be forthwith granted by the annexing city a franchise to continue such business within the annexed territory for a term of not less than the remaining term of the original franchise or permit, or not less than seven years, whichever is the shorter period, and the city, by franchise, permit, or public operation, shall not extend similar or competing services to the annexed territory except upon a proper showing of the inability or refusal of such person, firm, or corporation to adequately service the annexed territory at a reasonable price. Upon the effective date specified by the code city council's ordinance or resolution to have the code city contract for solid waste collection or undertake solid waste collection itself, the transition period specified in this section begins to run. This section does not preclude the purchase by the annexing city of the franchise, business, or facilities at an agreed or negotiated price, or from acquiring the same by condemnation upon payment of damages, including a reasonable amount for the loss of the franchise or permit.

<p>A code city as provided in RCW 35A.14.296(2) may collaborate with the county or counties where the code city is located to form an interlocal agreement regarding annexation of unincorporated territory within the urban growth area boundary. The interlocal agreement formation process must include procedures for public participation. The procedures must provide for broad dissemination of proposals and alternatives, opportunity for written comments, public meetings after effective notice, and consideration of and response to public comments. The interlocal agreement may only be executed after notice of availability of the agreement is posted on the website of each legislative body for four weeks and a public hearing by each legislative body, separately or jointly. This method of annexation shall be an alternative method and is additional to all other methods provided for in this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An interlocal agreement under this section may include use of a sales tax credit for annexed areas should such a credit be reinstated by the legislature.</p>

<p>A balancing of annexations of commercial, industrial, and residential properties so that any potential loss or gain is considered and distributed fairly as determined by tax revenue;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Development, ownership, and maintenance of infrastructure;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The potential for revenue-sharing agreements.</p>
</li>
</ol>
