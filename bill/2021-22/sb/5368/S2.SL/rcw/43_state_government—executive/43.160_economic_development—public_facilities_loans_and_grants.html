<li>
<p>The legislature finds that it is the public policy of the state of Washington to direct financial resources toward the fostering of economic development through the stimulation of investment and job opportunities and the retention of sustainable existing employment for the general welfare of the inhabitants of the state. Reducing unemployment and reducing the time citizens remain jobless is important for the economic welfare of the state. A valuable means of fostering economic development is the construction of public facilities which contribute to the stability and growth of the state's economic base. Expenditures made for these purposes as authorized in this chapter are declared to be in the public interest, and constitute a proper use of public funds. A community economic revitalization board is needed which shall aid the development of economic opportunities. The general objectives of the board should include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Strengthening the economies of areas of the state which have experienced or are expected to experience chronically high unemployment rates or below average growth in their economies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encouraging the diversification of the economies of the state and regions within the state in order to provide greater seasonal and cyclical stability of income and employment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encouraging wider access to financial resources for both large and small industrial development projects;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encouraging new economic development or expansions to maximize employment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encouraging the retention of viable existing firms and employment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing incentives for expansion of employment opportunities for groups of state residents that have been less successful relative to other groups in efforts to gain permanent employment; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhancing job and business growth through facility development and other improvements in innovation partnership zones designated under RCW 43.330.270.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that the state's economic development efforts can be enhanced by, in certain instances, providing funds to improve state highways, county roads, or city streets for industries considering locating or expanding in this state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds it desirable to provide a process whereby the need for diverse public works improvements necessitated by planned economic development can be addressed in a timely fashion and with coordination among all responsible governmental entities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that the state's economic development efforts can be enhanced by, in certain instances, providing funds to assist development of telecommunications infrastructure that supports business development, retention, and expansion in the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that the state's economic development efforts can be enhanced by providing funds to improve markets for those recyclable materials representing a large fraction of the waste stream. The legislature finds that public facilities which result in private construction of processing or remanufacturing facilities for recyclable materials are eligible for consideration from the board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that sharing economic growth statewide is important to the welfare of the state. The ability of communities to pursue business and job retention, expansion, and development opportunities depends on their capacity to ready necessary economic development project plans, sites, permits, and infrastructure for private investments. Project-specific planning, predevelopment, and infrastructure are critical ingredients for economic development. It is, therefore, the intent of the legislature to increase the amount of funding available through the community economic revitalization board and to authorize flexibility for available resources in these areas to help fund planning, predevelopment, and construction costs of infrastructure and facilities and sites that foster economic vitality and diversification.</p>

<p>The board is authorized to make direct loans to political subdivisions of the state and to federally recognized Indian tribes for the purposes of assisting the political subdivisions and federally recognized Indian tribes in financing the cost of public facilities, including development of land and improvements for public facilities, project-specific environmental, capital facilities, land use, permitting, feasibility, and marketing studies and plans; project design, site planning, and analysis; project debt and revenue impact analysis; as well as the construction, rehabilitation, alteration, expansion, or improvement of the facilities. A grant may also be authorized for purposes designated in this chapter, but only when, and to the extent that, a loan is not reasonably possible, given the limited resources of the political subdivision or the federally recognized Indian tribe and the finding by the board that financial circumstances require grant assistance to enable the project to move forward. However, no more than twenty-five percent of all financial assistance approved by the board in any biennium may consist of grants to political subdivisions and federally recognized Indian tribes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application for funds must be made in the form and manner as the board may prescribe. In making grants or loans the board must conform to the following requirements:</p>
<ol type="a">

</li>
<li>
<p>For a project located outside the jurisdiction of the applicant political subdivision or federally recognized Indian tribe.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board may only provide financial assistance:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>For a project demonstrating convincing evidence that a specific private development or expansion is ready to occur and will occur only if the public facility improvement is made that:</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>
<p>Results in the creation of significant private sector jobs or significant private sector capital investment as determined by the board; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will improve the opportunities for the successful maintenance, establishment, or expansion of industrial or commercial plants or will otherwise assist in the creation or retention of long-term economic opportunities;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>An application must be approved by the political subdivision and supported by the local associate development organization or local workforce development council or approved by the governing body of the federally recognized Indian tribe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board may allow de minimis general system improvements to be funded if they are critically linked to the viability of the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An application must demonstrate convincing evidence that the median hourly wage of the private sector jobs created after the project is completed will exceed the countywide median hourly wage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board must prioritize each proposed project according to:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The relative benefits provided to the community by the jobs the project would create, not just the total number of jobs it would create after the project is completed, but also giving consideration to the unemployment rate in the area in which the jobs would be located;</p>
<ol type="i" start="2">
<li>
<p>The rate of return of the state's investment, including, but not limited to, the leveraging of private sector investment, anticipated job creation and retention, and expected increases in state and local tax revenues associated with the project;</p>

<p>Whether the proposed project offers a health insurance plan for employees that includes an option for dependents of employees;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the public facility investment will increase existing capacity necessary to accommodate projected population and employment growth in a manner that supports infill and redevelopment of existing urban or industrial areas that are served by adequate public facilities. Projects should maximize the use of existing infrastructure and provide for adequate funding of necessary transportation improvements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the applicant's permitting process has been certified as streamlined by the office of regulatory assistance; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the applicant has developed and adhered to guidelines regarding its permitting process for those applying for development permits consistent with section 1(2), chapter 231, Laws of 2007.</p>
