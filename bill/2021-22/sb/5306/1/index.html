<h2 id="section-1-678">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-678">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that salmon recovery efforts have been instrumental in helping some species turn the corner towards recovery and have slowed the decline of several other species. However, while great progress has been made in implementing critical salmon recovery projects, more work is needed at the state, but also, local level in order to further protect and restore habitat.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that the state's population has continued to grow at a dramatic pace, growing by 1.6 million people since 1999, when the statewide salmon recovery strategy was adopted. A growing population needs housing, drinkable water, and other resources, which can put a strain on habitat critical to salmon. Development along shorelines can erode coastal areas, leaving beaches inhospitable to salmon and the fish they eat. Development of land along streams often removes the trees and bushes that provide shade, filter pollution, and create beneficial salmon habitat with discarded leaves and branches. Land development also increases paving and impervious surfaces, which in turn increases the amount of pollution and contaminated stormwater entering waterways. Finally, population growth increases the need for water for drinking, for use in homes and businesses, and for irrigation. More demand for water often impacts the quality and the amount of water left in streams to support salmon.</p>
<p>Moreover, since much of growth planning occurs at the local level, the legislature finds that statewide salmon recovery and conservation efforts could benefit further through strengthened policies and regulations adopted by counties and cities. Therefore, the legislature intends to enact guidelines for the preservation and enhancement of anadromous fisheries in order to assist counties and cities with the development of planning initiatives beneficial to local and statewide salmon recovery.</p>

<p>Subject to the definitions provided in RCW 36.70A.030, the department shall adopt guidelines, under chapter 34.05 RCW, no later than September 1, 1990, to guide the classification of: (a) Agricultural lands; (b) forestlands; (c) mineral resource lands; and (d) critical areas. The department shall consult with the department of agriculture regarding guidelines for agricultural lands, the department of natural resources regarding forestlands and mineral resource lands,  the department of ecology regarding critical areas**, and the department of fish and wildlife regarding conservation and protection of anadromous fisheries in critical areas, utilizing the guidelines developed in RCW 36.70A.172**.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In carrying out its duties under this section, the department shall consult with interested parties, including but not limited to: (a) Representatives of cities; (b) representatives of counties; (c) representatives of developers; (d) representatives of builders; (e) representatives of owners of agricultural lands, forestlands, and mining lands; (f) representatives of local economic development officials; (g) representatives of environmental <strong>and conservation</strong> organizations; (h) representatives of special districts; (i) representatives of the governor's office and federal and state agencies; and (j) representatives of Indian tribes. In addition to the consultation required under this subsection, the department shall conduct public hearings in the various regions of the state. The department shall consider the public input obtained at such public hearings when adopting the guidelines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The guidelines under subsection (1) of this section shall be minimum guidelines that apply to all jurisdictions, but also shall allow for regional differences that exist in Washington state. The intent of these guidelines is to assist counties and cities in designating the classification of agricultural lands, forestlands, mineral resource lands, and critical areas under RCW 36.70A.170.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The guidelines established by the department under this section regarding classification of forestlands shall not be inconsistent with guidelines adopted by the department of natural resources.</p>
