<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington state has one of the strongest economies in the country. However, despite the strong economy, our state has entered an affordable housing crisis where low-income and middle-income households have the fewest number of housing options. Furthermore, it is estimated that Washington state's housing gap is among the most severe in the nation, with only 29 affordable and available rental homes for every 100 extremely low-income households.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature concludes that in the spirit of one Washington, the health of all Washingtonians will benefit from a larger stock in affordable housing. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to incentivize real property transfers to nonprofit housing providers, public housing authorities, or local governments to increase the availability of affordable housing for low-income Washingtonians.</p>

<p>This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preferences in sections 3 and 4, chapter . . ., Laws of 2022 (sections 3 and 4 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preferences. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature categorizes this tax preference as one intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(a).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to encourage sales or transfers of real property to nonprofit entities, housing authorities, or public corporations that intend to use the transferred property for rental housing for low-income persons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a review finds that the number of sales or transfers of real property to qualified entities has not increased, then the legislature intends to repeal the expiration date of the tax preference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may refer to any available data source, including the transfer or sale of properties reported by county records.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.45_excise_tax_on_real_estate_sales.html">82.45.010</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.45_excise_tax_on_real_estate_sales.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As used in this chapter, the term &quot;sale&quot; has its ordinary meaning and includes any conveyance, grant, assignment, quitclaim, or transfer of the ownership of or title to real property, including standing timber, or any estate or interest therein for a valuable consideration, and any contract for such conveyance, grant, assignment, quitclaim, or transfer, and any lease with an option to purchase real property, including standing timber, or any estate or interest therein or other contract under which possession of the property is given to the purchaser, or any other person at the purchaser's direction, and title to the property is retained by the vendor as security for the payment of the purchase price. The term also includes the grant, assignment, quitclaim, sale, or transfer of improvements constructed upon leased land.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The term &quot;sale&quot; also includes the transfer or acquisition within any thirty-six month period of a controlling interest in any entity with an interest in real property located in this state for a valuable consideration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the sole purpose of determining whether, pursuant to the exercise of an option, a controlling interest was transferred or acquired within a thirty-six month period, the date that the option agreement was executed is the date on which the transfer or acquisition of the controlling interest is deemed to occur. For all other purposes under this chapter, the date upon which the option is exercised is the date of the transfer or acquisition of the controlling interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this subsection, all acquisitions of persons acting in concert must be aggregated for purposes of determining whether a transfer or acquisition of a controlling interest has taken place. The department must adopt standards by rule to determine when persons are acting in concert. In adopting a rule for this purpose, the department must consider the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Persons must be treated as acting in concert when they have a relationship with each other such that one person influences or controls the actions of another through common ownership; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When persons are not commonly owned or controlled, they must be treated as acting in concert only when the unity with which the purchasers have negotiated and will consummate the transfer of ownership interests supports a finding that they are acting as a single entity. If the acquisitions are completely independent, with each purchaser buying without regard to the identity of the other purchasers, then the acquisitions are considered separate acquisitions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The term &quot;sale&quot; does not include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A transfer by gift, devise, or inheritance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A transfer by transfer on death deed, to the extent that it is not in satisfaction of a contractual obligation of the decedent owed to the recipient of the property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A transfer of any leasehold interest other than of the type mentioned above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A cancellation or forfeiture of a vendee's interest in a contract for the sale of real property, whether or not such contract contains a forfeiture clause, or deed in lieu of foreclosure of a mortgage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The partition of property by tenants in common by agreement or as the result of a court decree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The assignment of property or interest in property from one spouse or one domestic partner to the other spouse or other domestic partner in accordance with the terms of a decree of dissolution of marriage or state registered domestic partnership or in fulfillment of a property settlement agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The assignment or other transfer of a vendor's interest in a contract for the sale of real property, even though accompanied by a conveyance of the vendor's interest in the real property involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfers by appropriation or decree in condemnation proceedings brought by the United States, the state or any political subdivision thereof, or a municipal corporation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A mortgage or other transfer of an interest in real property merely to secure a debt, or the assignment thereof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any transfer or conveyance made pursuant to a deed of trust or an order of sale by the court in any mortgage, deed of trust, or lien foreclosure proceeding or upon execution of a judgment, or deed in lieu of foreclosure to satisfy a mortgage or deed of trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A conveyance to the federal housing administration or veterans administration by an authorized mortgagee made pursuant to a contract of insurance or guaranty with the federal housing administration or veterans administration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A transfer in compliance with the terms of any lease or contract upon which the tax as imposed by this chapter has been paid or where the lease or contract was entered into prior to the date this tax was first imposed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sale of any grave or lot in an established cemetery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A sale by the United States, this state or any political subdivision thereof, or a municipal corporation of this state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A sale to a regional transit authority or public corporation under RCW 81.112.320 under a sale/leaseback agreement under RCW 81.112.300.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A transfer of real property, however effected, if it consists of a mere change in identity or form of ownership of an entity where there is no change in the beneficial ownership. These include transfers to a corporation or partnership which is wholly owned by the transferor and/or the transferor's spouse or domestic partner or children of the transferor or the transferor's spouse or domestic partner. However, if thereafter such transferee corporation or partnership voluntarily transfers such real property, or such transferor, spouse or domestic partner, or children of the transferor or the transferor's spouse or domestic partner voluntarily transfer stock in the transferee corporation or interest in the transferee partnership capital, as the case may be, to other than (i) the transferor and/or the transferor's spouse or domestic partner or children of the transferor or the transferor's spouse or domestic partner, (ii) a trust having the transferor and/or the transferor's spouse or domestic partner or children of the transferor or the transferor's spouse or domestic partner as the only beneficiaries at the time of the transfer to the trust, or (iii) a corporation or partnership wholly owned by the original transferor and/or the transferor's spouse or domestic partner or children of the transferor or the transferor's spouse or domestic partner, within three years of the original transfer to which this exemption applies, and the tax on the subsequent transfer has not been paid within sixty days of becoming due, excise taxes become due and payable on the original transfer as otherwise provided by law.</p>

<p>A transfer that for federal income tax purposes does not involve the recognition of gain or loss for entity formation, liquidation or dissolution, and reorganization, including but not limited to nonrecognition of gain or loss because of application of 26 U.S.C. Sec. 332, 337, 351, 368(a)(1), 721, or 731 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, the transfer described in (q)(i) of this subsection cannot be preceded or followed within a thirty-six month period by another transfer or series of transfers, that, when combined with the otherwise exempt transfer or transfers described in (q)(i) of this subsection, results in the transfer of a controlling interest in the entity for valuable consideration, and in which one or more persons previously holding a controlling interest in the entity receive cash or property in exchange for any interest the person or persons acting in concert hold in the entity. This subsection (3)(q)(ii) does not apply to that part of the transfer involving property received that is the real property interest that the person or persons originally contributed to the entity or when one or more persons who did not contribute real property or belong to the entity at a time when real property was purchased receive cash or personal property in exchange for that person or persons' interest in the entity. The real estate excise tax under this subsection (3)(q)(ii) is imposed upon the person or persons who previously held a controlling interest in the entity.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this subsection (3)(s), &quot;qualified low-income housing development&quot; means real property and improvements in respect to which the seller or, in the case of a transfer of a controlling interest, the owner or beneficial owner, was allocated federal low-income housing tax credits authorized under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 42 or successor statute, by the Washington state housing finance commission or successor state-authorized tax credit allocating agency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This subsection (3)(s) does not apply to transfers of a qualified low-income housing development or controlling interest in a qualified low-income housing development occurring on or after July 1, 2035.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Washington state housing finance commission, in consultation with the department, must gather data on: (A) The fiscal savings, if any, accruing to transferees as a result of the exemption provided in this subsection (3)(s); (B) the extent to which transferors of qualified low-income housing developments receive consideration, including any assumption of debt, as part of a transfer subject to the exemption provided in this subsection (3)(s); and (C) the continued use of the property for low-income housing. The Washington state housing finance commission must provide this information to the joint legislative audit and review committee.
