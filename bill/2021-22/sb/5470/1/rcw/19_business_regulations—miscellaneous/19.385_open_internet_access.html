</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Broadband internet access service&quot; also encompasses any service that the federal communications commission finds to be providing a functional equivalent of the service described in (a) of this subsection, or that is used to evade the protections set forth in RCW 19.385.020.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Data cap&quot; means a limitation on the amount of data that an end user is allowed to use, or the imposition of a charge on the end user for exceeding a certain data usage threshold.</p>

<li>
<p>&quot;End user&quot; means any individual or entity that uses a broadband internet access service.</p>
</li>
<li>
