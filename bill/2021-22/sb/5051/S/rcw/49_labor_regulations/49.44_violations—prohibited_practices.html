<p>The legislature intends that public employers be prohibited from misclassifying employees, or taking other action to avoid providing or continuing to provide employment-based benefits to which employees are entitled under state law or employer policies or collective bargaining agreements applicable to the employee's correct classification.</p>
<p>Chapter 155, Laws of 2002 does not mandate that any public employer provide benefits to actual temporary, seasonal, or part-time employees beyond the benefits to which they are entitled under state law or employer policies or collective bargaining agreements applicable to the employee's correct classification. Public employers may determine eligibility rules for their own benefit plans and may exclude categories of workers such as &quot;temporary&quot; or &quot;seasonal,&quot; so long as the definitions and eligibility rules are objective and applied on a consistent basis. Objective standards, such as control over the work and the length of the employment relationship, should determine whether a person is an employee who is entitled to employee benefits, rather than the arbitrary application of labels, such as &quot;temporary&quot; or &quot;contractor.&quot; Common law standards should be used to determine whether a person is performing services as an employee, as a contractor, or as part of an agency relationship.</p>
<p>Chapter 155, Laws of 2002 does not modify any statute or policy regarding the employment of: Public employee retirees who are hired for postretirement employment as provided for in chapter 41.26, 41.32, 41.35, or 41.40 RCW or who work as contractors; or enrolled students who receive employment as student employees or as part of their education or financial aid.</p>
