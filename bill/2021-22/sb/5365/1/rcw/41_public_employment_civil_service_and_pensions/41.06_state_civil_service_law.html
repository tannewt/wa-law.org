<p>The labor market and the state government workforce are diverse in terms of gender, race, ethnicity, age, and the presence of disabilities.</p>

<p>The state's personnel resource and management practices must be responsive to the diverse nature of its workforce composition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Managers in all agencies play a key role in the implementation of all critical personnel policies.</p>

</ol>

</ol>
<p>It is therefore the policy of the state to create an organizational culture in state government that respects and values individual differences and encourages the productive potential of every employee.</p>

<p>To implement this policy:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The office of financial management shall, in consultation with agencies, employee organizations, employees, institutions of higher education, and related boards, review civil service rules and related policies to ensure that they support the state's policy of valuing and managing diversity in the workplace; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of enterprise services, in consultation with agencies, employee organizations, and employees, institutions of higher education, and related boards, develop training programs for all managers to enhance their ability to implement diversity policies and to provide a thorough grounding in all aspects of the state civil service law and merit system rules, and how the proper implementation and application thereof can facilitate and further the mission of the agency.</p>

<p>Meaningful and effective involvement of employees and their representatives is essential to the efficient and effective delivery of state government services. To accomplish this, agencies shall use joint employee-management committees to collaborate on the desired goals of streamlined organizational structures, continuous improvement in all systems and processes, empowerment of line level employees to solve workplace and system delivery problems, managers functioning as coaches and facilitators, and employee training and development as an investment in the future. If employees are represented by an exclusive bargaining representative, the representative shall select the employee committee members and also be on the committee. In addition, the committees shall be used for improvement of the quality of work life for state employees resulting in more productive and efficient service delivery to the general public and customers of state government.
