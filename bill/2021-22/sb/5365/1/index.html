<h2 id="section-1-826">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-826">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the board exists to promote safe communities and public safety. However, there is no agency to promote the growth and development of the cannabis industry within the state. The legislature therefore declares:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Washington state cannabis commission is established to benefit the people of the state of Washington and its economy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The production of cannabis in the state is a new and important segment of Washington industry, that has potential for greater contribution to the economy of the state if it undergoes safe and healthy development;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The general welfare of the people of the state will be served by the development of the safe growing and processing activities of cannabis. The industry is therefore affected with the public interest;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creation of a Washington state cannabis commission for the public purpose of administering the revenue of the commission for the enhancement of the safe production of cannabis will materially advance the industries of growing and processing cannabis and thereby the interests of the citizens of the state; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commerce of cannabis grown, produced, and processed in the state will contribute substantial benefits to the economy of the state, provide a large number of jobs, sizeable tax revenues, and have an important stabilizing effect on prices received by cannabis producers. The sale and distribution are therefore affected with the public interest.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2-653">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-653">¶</a></h2>
<p>To develop and promote cannabis and cannabis products as part of an existing comprehensive scheme to regulate those products, the legislature declares that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Cannabis producers operate within a regulatory environment that imposes burdens on them for the benefit of society and the citizens of the state, including restrictions on marketing autonomy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is in the overriding public interest that support of the legal cannabis industry be clearly expressed and that cannabis and cannabis products be promoted individually, and as part of a comprehensive industry to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Protect the public by educating the public in reference to the quality, care, and methods used in the production of cannabis and cannabis products;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase the knowledge and qualities and value of Washington's cannabis and cannabis products; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support and engage in programs or activities that benefit the safe production, handling, processing, marketing, and uses of cannabis and cannabis products; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The production and marketing of cannabis is a highly regulated industry and this chapter and the rules adopted under it are only one aspect of the regulated industry. Other laws applicable to the cannabis industry include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Chapter 15.130 RCW, the food safety and security act;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 15.125 RCW, marijuana and marijuana products;</p>
