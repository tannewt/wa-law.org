However, this subsection does not require an employer who is currently paying for all or part of a health plan for its retired and disabled employees to discontinue those payments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payments for continued participation in a former employer's health plan may be assigned to the underwriter of the health plan from public pension benefits or may be paid to the former employer, as determined by the former employer, so that an underwriter of the health plan that is an insurance company, health care service contractor, or health maintenance organization is not required to accept individual payments from persons continuing participation in the employer's health plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After an initial open enrollment period of ninety days after January 1, 2003, an employer may not be required to permit a person to continue participation in the health plan if the person is responsible for a lapse in coverage under the plan. In addition, an employer may not be required to permit a person to continue participation in the employer's health plan if the employer offered continued participation in a health plan that meets the requirements of chapter 319, Laws of 2002.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a person continuing participation in the former employer's health plan has medical coverage available through another employer, the medical coverage of the other employer is the primary coverage for purposes of coordination of benefits as provided for in the former employer's health plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a person's continued participation in a health plan was permitted because of the person's relationship to a retired or disabled employee of the employer providing the health plan and the retired or disabled employee dies, then that person is permitted to continue participation in the health plan for a period of not more than six months after the death of the retired or disabled employee. However, the employer providing the health plan may permit continued participation beyond that time period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An employer may offer one or more health plans different from that provided for active employees and designed to meet the needs of persons requesting continued participation in the employer's health plan. An employer, in designing or offering continued participation in a health plan, may utilize terms or conditions necessary to administer the plan to the extent the terms and conditions do not conflict with this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an employer changes the underwriter of a health plan, the replaced underwriter has no further responsibility or obligation to persons who continued participation in a health plan of the replaced underwriter. However, the employer shall permit those persons to participate in any new health plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The benefits granted under this section are not considered a matter of contractual right. Should the legislature, a county, municipality, or other political subdivision of the state revoke or change any benefits granted under this section, an affected person is not entitled to receive the benefits as a matter of contractual right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not affect any health plan contained in a collective bargaining agreement in existence as of January 1, 2003. However, any plan contained in future collective bargaining agreements shall conform to this section. In addition, this section does not affect any health plan contract or policy in existence as of January 1, 2003. However, any renewal of the contract or policy shall conform to this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Counties, municipalities, and other political subdivisions that make a documented good faith effort to comply with the provisions of subsections (2) through (11) of this section and are unable to provide access to a fully insured group health benefit plan are discharged from any obligations under subsections (2) through (11) of this section but shall assist disabled employees and retired employees in applying for health insurance. Assistance may include developing and distributing standardized information on the availability and cost of individual health benefit plans, application packages, and health benefit fairs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of the insurance commissioner shall make available to counties, municipalities, and other political subdivisions information regarding individual health benefit plans, including a list of carriers offering individual coverage, the rates charged, and how to apply for coverage.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Medical expense plans authorized by subsection (7) of this section must require as a condition of participation in the plan that employees in the group affected by the plan sign an agreement with the employer. The agreement must include a provision to hold the employer harmless should the United States government find that the employer or the employee is in debt to the United States as a result of the employee not paying income taxes due on the equivalent funds placed into the plan, or as a result of the employer not withholding or deducting a tax, assessment, or other payment on the funds as required by federal law. The agreement must also include a provision that requires an eligible employee to forfeit remuneration under subsection (3) of this section if the employee belongs to a group that has been designated to participate in the medical expense plan permitted under this section and the employee refuses to execute the required agreement.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that (1) demographic, economic, and social trends underlie a critical and increasing demand for child care in the state of Washington; (2) working parents and their children benefit when the employees' child care needs have been resolved; (3) the state of Washington should serve as a model employer by creating a supportive atmosphere, to the extent feasible, in which its employees may meet their child care needs; and (4) the state of Washington should encourage the development of partnerships between state agencies, state employees, state employee labor organizations, and private employers to expand the availability of affordable quality child care. The legislature finds further that resolving employee child care concerns not only benefits the employees and their children, but may benefit the employer by reducing absenteeism, increasing employee productivity, improving morale, and enhancing the employer's position in recruiting and retaining employees. Therefore, the legislature declares that it is the policy of the state of Washington to assist state employees by creating a supportive atmosphere in which they may meet their child care needs. Policies and procedures for state agencies to address employee child care needs will be the responsibility of the director of enterprise services in consultation with the secretary of the department of children, youth, and families and state employee representatives.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that flexible-time work schedules, which provide varying times for employees to arrive at and depart from work, tend to alleviate traffic congestion during peak rush hour periods and thereby reduce hazardous traffic conditions; provide more efficient use of highways and other transit facilities; and decrease fuel consumption. In addition, the legislature finds that flexible-time work schedules provide families in which both parents work outside of the home with the flexibility necessary to provide for day care; provide employees with flexibility allowing them to spend more time with their families; improve employee morale and, in-so-doing, improve productivity. Therefore, due to the clear advantages to both agencies and employees, the legislature finds that flexible-time work schedules should be utilized by agencies to the maximum extent possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As used in this section, &quot;flexible-time work schedule&quot; means a daily work schedule which contains a core time of required hours during which an employee subject to the schedule is required to be present for work and designated hours before or after the core time during which an employee, with the approval of his or her agency, may elect a time of arrival to work and departure from work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each agency shall prepare a flexible-time work schedule or schedules and shall offer the schedule or schedules to employees as an option to the traditional eight o'clock a.m. to five o'clock p.m. working day. However, an agency shall not be required to prepare or offer a flexible-time work schedule or schedules if the agency head determines that the implementation of such a schedule would serve as an impediment to the provision of services to the public or would in any other way impede the agency in accomplishing its mission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any employee wishing to use a flexible-time work schedule prepared under subsection (3) of this section must first obtain the permission of the agency head or the agency head's designee. However, if there is an employee organization certified as an exclusive bargaining representative for a bargaining unit affected by the flexible-time work schedule, the agency shall first negotiate with the certified employee organization.</p>

<p>The sole purpose of RCW 41.04.445 and 41.04.450 is to allow the members of the retirement systems created in chapters 2.10, 2.12, 41.26, 41.32, 41.35, 41.37, 41.40, 41.34, and 43.43 RCW to enjoy the tax deferral benefits allowed under 26 U.S.C. 414(h). Chapter 227, Laws of 1984 does not alter in any manner the provisions of RCW 41.45.060, 41.45.061, and 41.45.067 which require that the member contribution rates shall be set so as to provide fifty percent of the cost of the respective retirement plans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should the legislature revoke any benefit allowed under 26 U.S.C. 414(h), no affected employee shall be entitled thereafter to receive such benefit as a matter of contractual right.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that: (1) State employees historically have joined together to help their fellow employees who suffer from, or have relatives or household members suffering from, an extraordinary or severe illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition which prevents the individual from working and causes great economic and emotional distress to the employee and his or her family; (2) state employees have also joined together to help their fellow employees who are sick or temporarily disabled because of pregnancy disability or for the purpose of parental leave to bond with the employee's newborn, adoptive, or foster child; and (3) these circumstances may be exacerbated because the affected employees use all their accrued sick leave and annual leave and are forced to take leave without pay or terminate their employment.
