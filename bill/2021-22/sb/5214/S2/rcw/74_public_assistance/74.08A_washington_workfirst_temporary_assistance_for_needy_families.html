<li>
<p>In order to prevent some families from developing dependency on temporary assistance for needy families, the department shall make available to qualifying applicants a diversion program designed to provide brief, emergency assistance for families in crisis whose income and assets would otherwise qualify them for temporary assistance for needy families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diversion assistance may include cash or vouchers in payment for the following needs:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Child care;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Housing assistance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transportation-related expenses;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Medical costs for the recipient's immediate family;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Employment-related expenses which are necessary to keep or obtain paid unsubsidized employment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diversion assistance is available once in each twelve-month period for each adult applicant. Recipients of diversion assistance are not included in the temporary assistance for needy families program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diversion assistance may not exceed one thousand five hundred dollars for each instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be eligible for diversion assistance, a family must otherwise be eligible for temporary assistance for needy families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Families ineligible for temporary assistance for needy families or benefits under RCW 74.62.030 due to sanction, noncompliance, the lump sum income rule, or any other reason are not eligible for diversion assistance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Families must provide evidence showing that a bona fide need exists according to subsection (2) of this section in order to be eligible for diversion assistance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>An adult applicant may receive diversion assistance of any type no more than once per twelve-month period. If the recipient of diversion assistance is placed on the temporary assistance for needy families program within twelve months of receiving diversion assistance, the prorated dollar value of the assistance shall be treated as a loan from the state, and recovered by deduction from the recipient's cash grant.</p>

<p>Each recipient shall be assessed after determination of program eligibility and before referral to job search. Assessments shall be based upon factors that are critical to obtaining employment, including but not limited to education, availability of child care, history of family violence, history of substance abuse, and other factors that affect the ability to obtain employment. Assessments may be performed by the department or by a contracted entity. The assessment shall be based on a uniform, consistent, transferable format that will be accepted by all agencies and organizations serving the recipient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the assessment, an individual responsibility plan shall be prepared that: (a) Sets forth an employment goal and a plan for maximizing the recipient's success at meeting the employment goal; (b) considers WorkFirst educational and training programs from which the recipient could benefit; (c) contains the obligation of the recipient to participate in the program by complying with the plan; (d) moves the recipient into full-time WorkFirst activities as quickly as possible; and (e) describes the services available to the recipient either during or after WorkFirst to enable the recipient to obtain and keep employment and to advance in the workplace and increase the recipient's wage earning potential over time.</p>

<li>
<p>The department shall waive the penalties required under subsection (4) of this section, subject to a finding that the recipient refused to engage in work for good cause provided in RCW 74.08A.270.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In consultation with the recipient, the department or contractor shall place the recipient into a work activity that is available in the local area where the recipient resides.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assessments conducted under this section shall include a consideration of the potential benefit to the recipient of engaging in financial literacy activities. The department shall consider the options for financial literacy activities available in the community, including information and resources available through the financial education public-private partnership created under RCW 28A.300.450.
