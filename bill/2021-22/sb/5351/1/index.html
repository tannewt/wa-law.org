<h2 id="section-1-200">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-200">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on small businesses in the state of Washington, particularly those ordered to close their doors and cease or limit operations under the state of emergency that the governor declared on February 29, 2020. Many of those small businesses hold insurance policies that include coverage to replace income lost due to loss of or damage to the business premises or other business property. However, insurers are broadly denying claims under those policies, arguing that &quot;loss&quot; and &quot;damage&quot; are synonymous and that no claims are merited absent a showing of actual physical damages to the premises.</p>
<p>The legislature notes that Washington state and federal courts that recently examined this issue have ruled clearly and unambiguously that the words &quot;loss&quot; and &quot;damage&quot; hold distinct meanings under Washington law in the context of business interruption insurance policies and should not be interpreted to render one word or the other superfluous. The legislature intends to codify this interpretation to provide greater clarity.</p>
<p>The legislature also finds that a significant amount of inaccurate information continues to circulate regarding claims for business interruption insurance coverage, which, coupled with the ongoing effects of the pandemic, may cause some policyholders to fail to timely pursue valid claims. For this reason, the legislature intends to give policyholders additional time to challenge the denial of business interruption insurance claims.</p>

<p>This act applies to all causes of action commenced on or after the effective date of this section, regardless of when the cause of action arose. To this extent, this act applies retroactively to February 29, 2020, when Governor Jay Inslee issued Proclamation 20-05, proclaiming a state of emergency for all counties throughout the state of Washington as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States. In all other respects this act applies prospectively.</p>
