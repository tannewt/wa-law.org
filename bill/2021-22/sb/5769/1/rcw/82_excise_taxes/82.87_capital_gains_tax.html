<li>
<p>Beginning January 1, 2022, an excise tax is imposed on the sale or exchange of long-term capital assets. Only individuals are subject to payment of the tax, which equals seven percent multiplied by an individual's Washington capital gains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tax levied in subsection (1) of this section is necessary for the support of the state government and its existing public institutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an individual's Washington capital gains are less than zero for a taxable year, no tax is due under this section and no such amount is allowed as a carryover for use in the calculation of that individual's adjusted capital gain, as defined in RCW 82.87.020(1), for any taxable year. To the extent that a loss carryforward is included in the calculation of an individual's federal net long-term capital gain and that loss carryforward is directly attributable to losses from sales or exchanges allocated to this state under RCW 82.87.100, the loss carryforward is included in the calculation of that individual's adjusted capital gain for the purposes of this chapter. An individual may not include any losses carried back for federal income tax purposes in the calculation of that individual's adjusted capital gain for any taxable year.</p>

<p>The tax imposed in this section applies to the sale or exchange of long-term capital assets owned by the taxpayer, whether the taxpayer was the legal or beneficial owner of such assets at the time of the sale or exchange. The tax applies when the Washington capital gains are recognized by the taxpayer in accordance with this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this chapter:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>An individual is considered to be a beneficial owner of long-term capital assets held by an entity that is a pass-through or disregarded entity for federal tax purposes, such as a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation, or grantor trust, to the extent of the individual's ownership interest in the entity as reported for federal income tax purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A nongrantor trust is deemed to be a grantor trust if the trust does not qualify as a grantor trust for federal tax purposes, and the grantor's transfer of assets to the trust is treated as an incomplete gift under Title 26 U.S.C. Sec. 2511 of the internal revenue code and its accompanying regulations. A grantor of such trust is considered the beneficial owner of the capital assets of the trust for purposes of the tax imposed in this section and must include any long-term capital gain or loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset by the trust in the calculation of that individual's adjusted capital gain, if such gain or loss is allocated to this state under RCW 82.87.100.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Except as provided in (b)(ii) and (iii) of this subsection, the value of the exemption under this subsection is equal to the fair market value of the real estate owned directly by the entity less its basis, at the time that the sale or exchange of the individual's interest occurs, multiplied by the percentage of the ownership interest in the entity which is sold or exchanged by the individual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a sale or exchange of an interest in an entity results in an amount directly attributable to real property and that is considered as an amount realized from the sale or exchange of property other than a capital asset under Title 26 U.S.C. Sec. 751 of the internal revenue code, such amount must not be considered in the calculation of an individual's exemption amount under (b)(i) of this subsection (2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Real estate not owned directly by the entity in which an individual is selling or exchanging the individual's interest must not be considered in the calculation of an individual's exemption amount under (b)(i) of this subsection (2).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fair market value of real estate may be established by a fair market appraisal of the real estate or an allocation of assets by the seller and the buyer made under Title 26 U.S.C. Sec. 1060 of the internal revenue code, as amended. However, the department is not bound by the parties' agreement as to the allocation of assets, allocation of consideration, or fair market value, if such allocations or fair market value do not reflect the fair market value of the real estate. The assessed value of the real estate for property tax purposes may be used to determine the fair market value of the real estate, if the assessed value is current as of the date of the sale or exchange of the ownership interest in the entity owning the real estate and the department determines that this method is reasonable under the circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The value of the exemption under this subsection (2) may not exceed the individual's long-term capital gain or loss from the sale or exchange of an interest in an entity for which the individual is claiming this exemption;</p>
