<p>&quot;Class A cannabinoid&quot; is a substance that meets the following structural and functional criteria:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>The substance exhibits the structural backbone of tetrahydrocannabinols and tetrahydrocannabinol-like (THC-like) molecules that include the interconnected three-ring system of a: Six-carbon aromatic ring; pyran ring; and cyclohexene ring. Known compounds that fit the description provided in this subsection (3)(b)(i) include:</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) Tetrahydrocannabinols – a single double-bond in the C ring:</p>
<p>(I) Delta-10-THC and isomers;</p>
<p>(II) Delta-9-THC and isomers;</p>
<p>(III) Delta-8-THC and isomers;</p>
<p>(IV) Delta-7-THC and isomers;</p>
<p>(V) Delta-6a-THC and isomers; and</p>
<p>(VI) Delta-10a-THC and isomers;</p>
<p>(B) Carboxylates (C-2 and C-4) of tetrahydrocannabinols:</p>
<p>(I) Delta-9-THCA acid (Delta-9-THCA);</p>
<p>(II) Similar carboxylates of Delta-9-THCA for tetrahydrocannabinols in (b)(i)(A)(I) through (VI) of this subsection; and</p>
<p>(III) Carboxylate esters in (b)(i)(A)(I) through (VI) of this subsection;</p>

<p>(I) Delta-9-THCP (Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabiphorol) and n-alkyl analogues;</p>
<p>(II) Similar alkylated analogues of Delta-9-THC for tetrahydrocannabinols in (b)(i)(A)(I) through (VI) of this subsection; and</p>
<p>(D) Hydroxylated analogues of tetrahydrocannabinols:</p>
<p>(I) 11-hydroxy-delta-9-THC and 8- and 10-hydroxy analogues; and</p>
<p>(II) Similar hydroxylated analogues of Delta-9-THC for tetrahydrocannabinols in (b)(i)(A)(I) through (VI) of this subsection;</p>
<pre><code>    ii. Possesses significant CB1 agonist activity as demonstrable by binding affinity (Ki) to the CB1 receptors at less than 200 nM; and

    iii. Results in positive effects for all four components of the tetrad test in rodents or reliably causes functional impairment in humans as assayed by a method possessing scientific consensus.

c. &quot;Class B cannabinoid&quot; means all hemp cannabinoids that do not meet the form and function of class A cannabinoids.

d. &quot;Hemp cannabinoid product&quot; means any consumable class B product derived from hemp as defined in RCW 15.140.020, which explicitly or implicitly markets cannabinoid concentration or otherwise contains a cannabinoid or cannabinoids to a significant degree for human or animal consumption above two percent.

e. &quot;Person&quot; includes individuals, partnerships, corporations, and associations.
