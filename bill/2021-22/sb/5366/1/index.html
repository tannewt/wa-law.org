<h2 id="section-1-562">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-562">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds and declares that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Washington state, through its extensive purchasing power, can accelerate necessary greenhouse gas reductions, improve human and environmental health, grow economic competitiveness, and promote high labor standards in manufacturing by incorporating climate and other types of pollution impacts and the quality of working conditions into the procurement process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington state does not currently spend public dollars for materials on state-funded infrastructure projects in a way that is consistent with the state's carbon reduction goals or its high environmental and labor standards. Meanwhile, the private sector is increasingly demanding building materials that reduce carbon and other types of pollution and support good jobs in manufacturing. For state spending, manufacturers that exploit workers and the environment are treated the same as manufacturers that meet high environmental and labor standards. This treatment puts manufacturers that invest in emissions reduction technologies, other pollution controls, and a 21st century workforce at a competitive disadvantage for state projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorporating carbon pollution, other types of pollution impacts, and working conditions into the procurement process will level the playing field for manufacturers that meet high environmental and labor standards. This process will encourage other manufacturers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, invest in pollution controls, and improve working conditions while growing the demand for ethically produced materials with a smaller environmental footprint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington state is already home to multiple world-class manufacturing facilities and with a low carbon electric grid and highly skilled workforce, the state is well-positioned to capture the growing demand for low carbon materials and create and sustain a new generation of good, high-wage clean manufacturing jobs. By leveling the playing field for manufacturers that meet high environmental and labor standards and meeting the growing demand for ethically and sustainably produced materials, Washington's manufacturing base will continue to expand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorporating emissions and working conditions into the procurement process will also improve the state's ability to make purchasing decisions that align with its carbon reduction goals and economic development goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great quantities of greenhouse gas emissions are released during the manufacturing of building materials and the state and local government are among the largest consumers of these building materials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature has committed to carbon reduction measures by requiring action by public agencies. Those actions do not currently encourage public dollars to be spent in a way that is consistent with the state's carbon reduction goals as it relates to the global warming potential embedded within the materials procured for state-funded infrastructure projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The buy clean and buy fair policies established in this chapter are critical to reduce embodied carbon in the built environment, a goal identified in the Washington state 2021 energy strategy to meet the state's greenhouse gas emission limits and governor Inslee's Executive Order 18-01 on state efficiency and environmental performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing financial assistance to small manufacturers to support the production of environmental product declarations will ensure that small manufacturers are not put at a competitive disadvantage in state contracting as a result of the requirements of this chapter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
