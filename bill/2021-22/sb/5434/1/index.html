<h2 id="section-1-596">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-596">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Washingtonians expect voter registration requirements and processes to ensure only eligible people under Article VI, section 1 of the Washington state Constitution and chapter 29A.08 RCW be granted the ability to vote in elections conducted in the state of Washington.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Article VI, section 1 of the Washington state Constitution explicitly states that all persons 18 years of age or older who are United States citizens and who have lived in the state, county, and precinct 30 days immediately preceding the election at which they offer to vote shall be entitled to vote at all elections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Same-day voter registration laws enable people 18 years of age or older who are United States citizens to submit an address change to their voter registration within 30 days of an election at which they offer to vote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Voters need additional assurance that only one ballot per voter will be accepted by local elections officials, even if more than one ballot is returned for a voter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To meet eligibility requirements to vote, including when a person is provided an opportunity to register to vote through obtaining a driver's license or identicard with the department of licensing, a person must submit a signed attestation that they are a United States citizen on their voter registration form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial barriers exist for applicants of enhanced driver's licenses, which require proof of United States citizenship, and disproportionately affect low-income people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All eligible people in Washington state should have access to voter registration methods that provide the greatest level of confidence that they are eligible to vote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local elections officials should have immediate access to comprehensive tools and information to conduct thorough searches of potentially duplicate voter registrations and active registrations of deceased voters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Misinformation and disinformation, as well as incomplete information about the level of voter fraud committed in Washington state, contributes to an ongoing lack of trust in election integrity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to defer future acts of voter fraud, the legislature requires more detailed accounts of the number of potential cases of improper voting referred to county prosecuting attorneys and of those cases compared to the number of cases found to be fraudulent.</p>
</li>
