<h2 id="section-1-77">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-77">¶</a></h2>
<p>This act shall be known and cited as the interstate nurse licensure compact of 2021.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-58">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-58">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The health and safety of the public are affected by the degree of compliance with and the effectiveness of enforcement activities related to state nurse licensure laws;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Violations of nurse licensure and other laws regulating the practice of nursing may result in injury or harm to the public;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The expanded mobility of nurses and the use of advanced communication technologies as part of our nation's health care delivery system require greater coordination and cooperation among states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New practice modalities and technology make compliance with individual state nurse licensure laws difficult and complex;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The current system of duplicative licensure for nurses practicing in multiple states is cumbersome and redundant for both nurses and states; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uniformity of nurse licensure requirements throughout the states promotes public safety and public health benefits.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The general purposes of this compact are to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Facilitate the states' responsibility to protect the public's health and safety;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure and encourage the cooperation of party states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitate the exchange of information between party states in the areas of nurse regulation, investigation, and adverse actions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote compliance with the laws governing the practice of nursing in each jurisdiction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invest all party states with the authority to hold a nurse accountable for meeting all state practice laws in the state in which the patient is located at the time care is rendered through the mutual recognition of party state licenses;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decrease redundancies in the consideration and issuance of nurse licenses; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide opportunities for interstate practice by nurses who meet uniform licensure requirements.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

If a party state takes such action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the home state of any such actions by remote states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A nurse practicing in a party state must comply with the state practice laws of the state in which the client is located at the time service is provided. The practice of nursing is not limited to patient care, but shall include all nursing practice as defined by the state practice laws of the party state in which the client is located. The practice of nursing in a party state under a multistate licensure privilege will subject a nurse to the jurisdiction of the licensing board, the courts, and the laws of the party state in which the client is located at the time service is provided.</p>

<li>
<p>Individuals not residing in a party state shall continue to be able to apply for a party state's single-state license as provided under the laws of each party state.

</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-5-22">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5-22">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Upon application for a multistate license, the licensing board in the issuing party state shall ascertain, through the coordinated licensure information system, whether the applicant has ever held, or is the holder of, a license issued by any other state, whether there are any encumbrances on any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, whether any adverse action has been taken against any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, and whether the applicant is currently participating in an alternative program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A nurse may hold a multistate license, issued by the home state, in only one party state at a time.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The nurse may apply for licensure in advance of a change in primary state of residence.</p>
</li>

<p>A multistate license shall not be issued by the new home state until the nurse provides satisfactory evidence of a change in primary state of residence to the new home state and satisfies all applicable requirements to obtain a multistate license from the new home state.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</ol>
<h2 id="section-6-21">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6-21">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a licensing board shall have the authority to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Take adverse action against a nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice within that party state.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Only the home state shall have the power to take adverse action against a nurse's license issued by the home state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state licensing board shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if such conduct had occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on a nurse's authority to practice within that party state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete any pending investigations of a nurse who changes primary state of residence during the course of such investigations.

The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the new home state of any such actions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses, as well as the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing board in a party state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another party state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain and submit, for each nurse licensure applicant, fingerprint or other biometric-based information to the federal bureau of investigation for criminal background checks, receive the results of the federal bureau of investigation record search on criminal background checks, and use the results in making licensure decisions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected nurse the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that nurse;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take adverse action based on the factual findings of the remote state, provided that the licensing board follows its own procedures for taking such adverse action.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If adverse action is taken by the home state against a nurse's multistate license, the nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice in all other party states shall be deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the multistate license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a nurse's multistate license shall include a statement that the nurse's multistate licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during the pendency of the order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this compact shall override a party state's decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action. The home state licensing board shall deactivate the multistate licensure privilege under the multistate license of any nurse for the duration of the nurse's participation in an alternative program.</p>
</li>

<p>All party states shall participate in a coordinated licensure information system of all licensed registered nurses, and licensed practical or vocational nurses. This system will include information on the licensure and disciplinary history of each nurse, as submitted by party states, to assist in the coordination of nurse licensure and enforcement efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The interstate commission, in consultation with the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system, shall formulate necessary and proper procedures for the identification, collection, and exchange of information under this compact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All licensing boards shall promptly report to the coordinated licensure information system any adverse action, any current significant investigative information, denials of applications, the reasons for such denials, and nurse participation in alternative programs known to the licensing board regardless of whether such participation is deemed nonpublic or confidential under state law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Current significant investigative information and participation in nonpublic or confidential alternative programs shall be transmitted through the coordinated licensure information system only to party state licensing boards.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all party state licensing boards contributing information to the coordinated licensure information system may designate information that may not be shared with nonparty states or disclosed to other entities or individuals without the express permission of the contributing state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any personally identifiable information obtained from the coordinated licensure information system by a party state licensing board shall not be shared with nonparty states or disclosed to other entities or individuals except to the extent permitted by the laws of the party state contributing the information.</p>
