<p>The legislature finds that a statewide emergency communications network of  911 telephone service, which allows an immediate display of a caller's identification and location, would serve to further the safety, health, and welfare of the state's citizens, and would save lives.

<p>The state  911 coordinator, with the advice and assistance of the  911 advisory committee, must set nondiscriminatory, uniform technical and operational standards consistent with the rules of the federal communications commission for the transmission of 911 calls from radio communications service companies and interconnected voice over internet protocol service companies to  911 emergency communications systems. These standards must <strong>be modernized to align with national standards adopted by the state of Washington in rule making and</strong> not exceed the requirements set by the federal communications commission. The authority given to the state  911 coordinator in this section is limited to setting standards as set forth in this section and does not constitute authority to regulate radio communications service companies or interconnected voice over internet protocol service companies.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that the state and counties should be provided with an additional revenue source to fund  911 emergency communications systems throughout the state on a multicounty or countywide basis. The legislature further finds that the most efficient and appropriate method of deriving additional revenue for this purpose is to impose an excise tax on the use of switched access lines, radio access lines, and interconnected voice over internet protocol service lines.</p>
