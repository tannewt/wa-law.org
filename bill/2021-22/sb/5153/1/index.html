<p>Washington state data shows that students of color, students who experience poverty, homelessness, or foster care, and students with disabilities have the highest rates of absences. Students who are chronically absent, defined as missing 10 percent or more of scheduled instructional days, are more likely not to read at grade level by the third grade and are less likely to graduate.</p>
<p>Absences can be an indicator to educators that a student's academic and social-emotional needs may not be met through the district, school, or classroom culture or climate. Absences can also cue educators that a student and their family may need additional support.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that a multitiered system of support that is inclusive of attendance ensures students benefit from nurturing environments and equitable access to instruction and supports that are culturally and linguistically responsive, universally designed, and differentiated to meet their unique needs. Such a system includes data-based decision making; team-driven leadership; family, student, and community engagement; delivery of a continuum of supports; and evidenced-based practices. Implementation of tiered supports will reduce absences, improve student success, and reduce the number of students that are referred to juvenile court for truancy. As such, the legislature intends to promote the expectation for and ability of school districts to use tiered supports for the purposes of increasing positive attendance.</p>

<p>If a parent enrolls a <strong>student</strong> who is six or seven years of age in a public school, the <strong>student</strong> is required to attend and that parent has the responsibility to ensure the <strong>student</strong> attends for the full time that school is in session. An exception shall be made to this requirement for <strong>students</strong> whose parents formally remove them from enrollment if the <strong>student</strong> is less than eight years old and a petition has not been filed against the parent under subsection (3) of this section. The requirement to attend school under this subsection does not apply to a <strong>student</strong> enrolled in a public school part-time for the purpose of receiving ancillary services.

<p>For purposes of this chapter, &quot;community <strong>engagement</strong> board&quot; means a board established pursuant to a memorandum of understanding between a juvenile court and a school district and composed of members of the local community in which the <strong>student</strong> attends school. Community <strong>engagement</strong> boards must include members who receive training regarding the identification of barriers to school attendance, the use of the Washington assessment of the risks and needs of students (WARNS) or other assessment tools to identify the specific needs of individual <strong>students</strong>, cultural responsive interactions, trauma-informed approaches to discipline, evidence-based treatments that have been found effective in supporting at-risk youth and their families, and the specific services and treatment available in the particular school, court, community, and elsewhere. Duties of a community <strong>engagement</strong> board shall include, but not be limited to: Identifying barriers to school attendance<strong>both inside and outside the school, including concerns with school climate, access to appropriate and culturally responsive curriculum, and necessary services for students with disabilities;</strong> recommending methods for improving attendance such as connecting students and their families with community services, culturally appropriate promising practices, and evidence-based services such as functional family therapy**;** suggesting to the school district that the <strong>student</strong> enroll in another school, an alternative education program, an education center, a skill center, a dropout prevention program, or another public or private educational program**;** or recommending to the juvenile court that a juvenile be offered the opportunity for placement in a HOPE center or crisis residential center, if appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>For purposes of this chapter, &quot;coordinated means of interventions&quot; are interventions provided in partnership with the court and are aimed at identifying barriers to school attendance and connecting students and their families with community services, culturally appropriate promising practices, and evidence-based services such as a truancy workshop, seminar, or a planning conference with the court, family, school, and/or relevant community organizations. The coordinated means of intervention may be less structured, formal, and resource-intensive than a community engagement board and are distinct from the interventions and supports provided by districts.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Districts and courts are encouraged to use a community engagement board when other coordinated means of support have already been attempted or exhausted.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that <strong>coordinated means of intervention and use</strong> of community <strong>engagement</strong> boards <strong>and other coordinated means of intervention are</strong> the preferred means of intervention when preliminary methods to eliminate or reduce unexcused absences as required by RCW 28A.225.020 have not been effective in securing the <strong>student's</strong> attendance at school. The legislature intends to encourage and support the development and expansion of community <strong>engagement</strong> boards. Operation of a school <strong>engagement</strong> board does not excuse a district from the obligation of filing a petition within the requirements of RCW 28A.225.015(3).</p>

<p>By the beginning of the 2017-18 school year, juvenile courts must establish, through a memorandum of understanding with each school district within their respective counties, a coordinated and collaborative approach to address truancy through the establishment of a community <strong>engagement</strong> board or, with respect to certain small districts, through other means as provided in subsection (3) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, each school district must enter into a memorandum of understanding with the juvenile court in the county in which it is located with respect to the operation of a community <strong>engagement</strong> board <strong>and other coordinated means of intervention</strong>. A community <strong>engagement</strong> board may be operated by a juvenile court, a school district, or a collaboration between both entities, so long as the agreement is memorialized in a memorandum of understanding. <strong>If a district serves students from multiple counties, the district shall enter into a memorandum of understanding with each jurisdiction, to ensure students have access to a community engagement board and community resources where the student lives.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A school district with fewer than <strong>300</strong> students must enter into a memorandum of understanding with the juvenile court in the county in which it is located with respect to: (a) The operation of a community <strong>engagement</strong> board; or (b) addressing truancy through other coordinated means of intervention . School districts with fewer than <strong>300</strong> students may work cooperatively with other school districts or the school district's educational service district to ensure access to a community <strong>engagement</strong> board or to provide other coordinated means of intervention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All school districts must designate, and identify to the local juvenile court and to the office of the superintendent of public instruction, a person or persons to coordinate school district efforts to address <strong>chronic</strong> absenteeism and truancy, including tasks associated with: Outreach and conferences pursuant to RCW 28A.225.018; entering into a memorandum of understanding with the juvenile court; establishing protocols and procedures with the court; coordinating trainings; sharing evidence-based and culturally appropriate promising practices; identifying a person within every school to serve as a contact with respect to <strong>chronic</strong> absenteeism and truancy; and assisting in the recruitment of community <strong>engagement</strong> board members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As has been demonstrated by school districts and county juvenile courts around the state that have worked together and led the way with community <strong>engagement</strong> boards, success has resulted from involving the entire community and leveraging existing dollars from a variety of sources, including public and private, local and state, and court, school, and community. In emulating this coordinated and collaborative approach statewide pursuant to local memoranda of understanding, courts and school districts are encouraged to create strong community-wide partnerships and to leverage existing dollars and resources.</p>

<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Best interest determinations should be made as quickly as possible in order to prevent educational discontinuity for the student.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When making best interest determinations, every effort should be made to gather meaningful input from relevant and appropriate persons on their perspectives regarding which school the student should attend during his or her time in out-of-home care, consistent with the student's case plan. Relevant and appropriate persons include:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>

<li>
<p>Depending on his or her age, the student.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>In accordance with RCW 74.13.550, whenever practical and in their best interest, students placed into out-of-home care must remain enrolled in the school that they were attending at the time they entered out-of-home care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Student-centered factors must be used to determine what is in a student's best interest. In order to make a well-informed best interest determination, a variety of student-centered factors should be considered, including:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>How long is the student's current out-of-home care placement expected to last?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the student's permanency plan and how does it relate to school stability?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many schools has the student attended in the current year?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many schools has the student attended over the past few years?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Considering the impacts of past transfers, how may transferring to a new school impact the student academically, emotionally, physically, and socially?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the immediate and long-term educational plans of, and for, the student?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How strong is the student academically?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the student has special needs, what impact will transferring to a new school have on the student's progress and services?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To what extent are the programs and activities at the potential new school comparable to, or more appropriate than, those at the school of origin?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does one school have programs and activities that address the unique needs or interests of the student that the other school does not have?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which school does the student prefer?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How deep are the <strong>student's</strong> ties to his or her school of origin?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Would the timing of the school transfer coincide with a logical juncture, such as after testing, after an event that is significant to the student, or at the end of the school year?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would changing schools affect the student's ability to earn full academic credit, participate in sports or other extracurricular activities, proceed to the next grade, or graduate on time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would the commute to the school under consideration impact the student, in terms of distance, mode of transportation, and travel time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How anxious is the student about having been removed from the home or about any upcoming moves?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What school does the student's sibling attend?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there safety issues to consider?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The student must remain in his or her school of origin while a best interest determination is made and while disputes are resolved in order to minimize disruption and reduce the number of school transfers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School districts are encouraged to use any:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Best interest determination guide developed by the office of the superintendent of public instruction during the discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of keeping the student in the school of origin or transferring the student to a new school; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dispute resolution process developed by the office of the superintendent of public instruction when there is a disagreement about school placement, the provision of educational services, or a dispute between agencies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The special education services of a student must not be interrupted by a transfer to a new school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;out-of-home care&quot; has the same meaning as in RCW 13.34.030.</p>
