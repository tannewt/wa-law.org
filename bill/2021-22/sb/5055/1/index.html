</li>
<li>
<p>If an arbitrator has a conflict of interest that may reasonably be expected to materially impact the arbitrator's impartiality, the arbitrator must disclose such conflict to the executive director. The executive director may determine whether the conflict merits assigning the next arbitrator on the roster. Either party may petition the executive director to have an assigned arbitrator removed due to a conflict of interest that may reasonably be expected to materially impact the arbitrator's impartiality. If their petition is granted by the executive director, the executive director must assign the next arbitrator or panel of arbitrators on the roster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall decide the grievance, and the decision is binding subject to the provisions of chapter 7.04A RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The parties may not participate in, negotiate for, or agree to the selection of an arbitrator or arbitration panel under this section.
