<p>The legislature finds that the state of Washington would benefit from the consistency and predictability of observing a standard time throughout the calendar year. Research has shown that changing to and from daylight saving time twice per year has negative impacts on public health, increases traffic accidents and crime, disrupts agriculture scheduling, and hinders economic growth. Scientific studies have connected a number of health consequences with the act of switching between standard time and daylight saving time, including greater risks of heart attacks, more frequent workplace injuries, and increased suicide rates in the days immediately following the switch. In addition, there are other political subdivisions within the United States that are petitioning congress for year-round daylight saving time or have changed their time zone over the years to create more consistency across the United States for convenience of commerce. The legislature passed Substitute House Bill No. 1196 in 2019 authorizing the state to observe daylight saving time year-round if authorized by the United States congress. However, congress has not amended federal law to authorize states to observe daylight saving time year-round. Therefore, the legislature intends to exercise the rights granted under the uniform time act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 260a(a), and exempt the state of Washington from the observance of daylight saving time and remain standard time year-round until congress authorizes states to observe daylight saving time year-round. The legislature also recognizes the potential impact the time zone has on communities along the border between Washington and other states and intends to allow the state to continue to review whether Pacific Standard Time should remain the standard time for Washington state or whether the state should seek authorization through the United States department of transportation to change Washington state to Mountain Standard Time year-round if year-round daylight saving time is not authorized by congress.</p>
