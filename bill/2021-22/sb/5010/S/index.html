<h2 id="section-1-1751">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1751">¶</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this act is to protect insureds from the possibility of adverse effects of the pandemic on their personal insurance rates by limiting the use of consumer credit history for a period of three years. This act will ensure that insurance does not become more unaffordable for individuals and families encountering financial challenges brought on by the pandemic by prohibiting its use unless the affect is an improved insurance score and lower premium. By providing this consumer protection during this extraordinary time, the legislature intends to provide necessary temporary relief to Washington state insureds whose credit scores have been negatively affected because of this economic crisis.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-1266">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-1266">¶</a></h2>

This requirement applies equally to a single insurer and two or more affiliated insurers. RCW 48.19.040(5) applies to information filed under this subsection except that any eligibility rules or guidelines shall be withheld from public inspection under RCW 48.02.120(3) from the date that the information is filed and after it becomes effective.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>If a consumer is charged higher premiums due to disputed credit history, the insurer shall rerate the policy retroactive to the effective date of the current policy term. As rerated, the consumer shall be charged the same premiums they would have been charged if accurate credit history was used to calculate an insurance score. This subsection applies only if the consumer resolves the dispute under the process set forth in the fair credit reporting act and notifies the insurer in writing that the dispute has been resolved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commissioner may adopt rules to implement this section.</p>

The special credit score rate rule shall contain the following language or substantively equivalent variations thereof: &quot;When the consumer credit history of a policyholder is reordered, it will only be used in the rating of the policy when the consumer credit history reorder result is equal to or better than that of the current consumer credit history under which the policy is rated.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>b. <strong>The commissioner shall approve the special credit score rate rule filing within 15 days of receipt.</strong></p>
