<p>In the case of underpayments to a member or beneficiary, the retirement system shall correct all future payments from the point of error detection, and shall compute the additional payment due for the allowable prior period which shall be paid in a lump sum by the appropriate retirement system.</p>

<li>
<p>Any organization that exclusively provides representation or services to retired members of the Washington state retirement systems and has membership dues deducted through the department of retirement systems has the right to request the department to assist in doing blind mailings to retirees twice each year. The mailings must provide information to members of the retirement systems eligible for membership in the retiree organization regarding services offered by the retiree organization. The mailings shall not be for the purpose of supporting or opposing any political party, ballot measure, or candidate. The retiree organization must provide all printed materials to be mailed and envelopes to a mail processing center and pay all costs for generating mailing labels, inserting materials into envelopes, sealing, labeling, and delivering materials to be mailed to a bulk mail center or post office. The organization must use its own bulk mail permit and pay all postage costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must provide requested retiree data for addressing the envelopes to the mail center under a secure data share agreement with the mail center under which neither the organizations nor any other entity has direct access to any names or addresses. The department has no obligation to approve or disapprove, or in any other way take any responsibility for, the content of the mailings. Only organizations that meet the requirements under subsection (1) of this section and have legal authority to provide services to retirement system retirees have the right to request assistance with blind mailings.</p>

<p>The merger of the assets, liabilities, and membership of the teachers' retirement system plan 1 and the law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system plan 1 in section 203 of this act may not impact benefits for members of these plans. Specifically, each member of each of these plans is entitled to receive benefits immediately after the merger on the effective date of this section that are equal to the benefits the member would have been entitled to receive immediately before the merger in accordance with plan terms. If the director determines that any provision of this act directly impacts benefits for members of the teachers' retirement system plan 1 or benefits for members of the law enforcement officers' and firefighters' retirement system plan 1, then the department is instructed to administer this act in a way that neither reduces, nor grants additional benefits, for members of those plans. The department may also conduct rule making for this purpose as provided in RCW 41.50.050.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must submit a request for both a private letter ruling and a determination letter from the federal internal revenue service indicating the qualified status of the merged plan that results from the merger of assets, liabilities, and membership in section 203 of this act.</p>
