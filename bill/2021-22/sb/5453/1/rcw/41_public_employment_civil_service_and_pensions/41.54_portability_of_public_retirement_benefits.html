<ol>
<li>
<p>&quot;Base salary&quot; means salaries or wages earned by a member of a system during a payroll period for personal services and includes wages and salaries deferred under provisions of the United States internal revenue code, but shall exclude overtime payments, nonmoney maintenance compensation, and lump sum payments for deferred annual sick leave, unused accumulated vacation, unused accumulated annual leave, any form of severance pay, any bonus for voluntary retirement, any other form of leave, or any similar lump sum payment; except that forms of payment which are excluded under this subsection shall be included in base salary when reportable to the department in all of a dual member's retirement systems, and when none of the dual member's retirement systems are the Washington state patrol retirement system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Department&quot; means the department of retirement systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Director&quot; means the director of the department of retirement systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Dual member&quot; means a person who (a) is or becomes a member of a system on or after July 1, 1988, (b) has been a member of one or more other systems, and (c) has never been retired for service from a retirement system and is not receiving a disability retirement or disability leave benefit from any retirement system listed in RCW 41.50.030 or subsection (6) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Service&quot; means the same as it may be defined in each respective system. For the purposes of RCW 41.54.030, military service granted under RCW 41.40.170(3) or 43.43.260 may only be based on service accrued under chapter 41.40 or 43.43 RCW, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;System&quot; means the retirement systems established under chapters <strong>41.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 803 of this act),</strong> 41.32, 41.40, 41.44, 41.35, 41.37, and 43.43 RCW; plan 2 of the system established under chapter 41.26 RCW; and the city employee retirement systems for Seattle, Tacoma, and Spokane.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Those persons who are dual members on or after July 1, 1988, shall not receive a retirement benefit from any prior system while dual members without the loss of all benefits under this chapter. Retroactive retirement in any prior system will cancel membership in any subsequent systems except as allowed under RCW 41.04.270 and will result in the refund of all employee and employer contributions made to such systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a member has withdrawn contributions from a prior system, the member may restore the contributions, together with interest since the date of withdrawal as determined by the system, and recover the service represented by the contributions. Such restoration must be completed within two years of establishing dual membership or prior to retirement, whichever occurs first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a member does not meet the time limitation under subsection (2) of this section, the member, prior to retirement, may restore the service credit destroyed by the withdrawn contributions by paying the amount required under RCW 41.50.165(2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any service accrued in one system by the member shall not accrue in any other system.</p>
