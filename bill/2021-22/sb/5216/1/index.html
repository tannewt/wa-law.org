<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington has among the largest number of tax preferences (i.e., credits, exemptions, deductions, and preferential rates) in the nation due in large part to the unique nature of the state's tax structure. The legislature finds that measuring and assessing the efficacy of such preferences is essential to ensure the most effective use of public resources, and that public access to easily available data is vital to conduct such evaluations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the efficacy of tax preferences assists lawmakers and the public in understanding the benefits of specific tax policy decisions to taxpayers, local economies, and the state. The legislature further finds the relevant information critical for such analysis is frequently not reported to the state department of revenue by taxpayers or is not publicly available. The legislature further finds the lack of accurate and ascertainable information has prevented the joint legislative audit and review committee tax preference performance review process from achieving the rigor of evaluation necessary to draw firm conclusions. The legislature further finds that this also limits the ability of lawmakers to access data of material importance for assessing proposed tax preference legislation or to fairly and accurately evaluate the merits of existing tax preferences. The legislature further finds that Washington state has been a leader among states since passage of the public disclosure act by initiative in 1972 in public disclosure of government records, state budget documents, and campaign finance and spending. The legislature further finds that similar leadership in the area of the public disclosure of tax preferences would allow the legislature and the public to assess the true impact of current tax policy or proposed tax legislation in a manner that is currently unattainable due to aggregated, anonymous data. Therefore, the legislature intends to establish consistent standards for the collection of data for the purposes of improving analysis of tax preferences and their benefits and public policy objective outcomes for taxpayers and relevant industries. The legislature further intends to make such information subject to public disclosure wherever possible to enable and improve lawmakers' and the public's understanding of the benefits and costs of tax preferences while ensuring that the release of such information does not cause economic harm to taxpayers claiming such preferences.</p>

<li>
<p>Taxpayers claiming a new tax preference must report the amount of the tax preference claimed by the taxpayer to the department as otherwise required by statute or determined by the department as part of the taxpayer's regular tax reporting responsibilities. For new tax preferences allowing certain types of gross income of the business to be excluded from business and occupation or public utility taxation, the tax return must explicitly report the amount of the exclusion, regardless of whether it is structured as an exemption or deduction, if the taxpayer is otherwise required to report taxes to the department on a monthly or quarterly basis. For a new sales and use tax exemption, the total purchase price or value of the exempt product or service subject to the exemption claimed by the buyer must be reported on an addendum to the buyer's tax return if the buyer is otherwise required to report taxes to the department on a monthly or quarterly basis and the buyer is required to submit an exemption certificate, or similar document, to the seller.</p>

<p>Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the amount <strong>of tax savings</strong> by a taxpayer for any new tax preference is subject to public disclosure and is not considered confidential tax information under RCW 82.32.330, if the reporting periods subject to disclosure ended at least <strong>24</strong> months prior to the date of disclosure and the taxpayer is required to report the amount of the tax preference claimed by the taxpayer to the department under subsection (7) of this section.</p>

<p>The department may waive the public disclosure requirement under (a) of this subsection (8) for good cause. Good cause may be demonstrated by a reasonable showing of economic harm to a taxpayer if the information specified under this subsection is disclosed. The waiver under this subsection (8)(b)(i) only applies to the new tax preferences provided in chapter 13, Laws of 2013 2nd sp. sess.</p>

<li>
<p>The amount of <strong>tax savings by a taxpayer for any new tax preference</strong> during a calendar year is confidential under RCW 82.32.330 and may not be disclosed under this subsection if the amount for the calendar year is less than <strong>$10,000</strong>.</p>

<p>If a new tax preference does not include the information required under subsections (2) through (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee is not required to perform a tax preference review under chapter 43.136 RCW, and it is legislatively presumed that it is the intent of the legislature to allow the new tax preference to expire upon its scheduled expiration date.</p>

<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;tax preference&quot; and &quot;new tax preference&quot; have the same meaning as provided in RCW 82.32.805.</p>

<p>The provisions of this section do not apply to the extent that legislation creating a new tax preference provides an exemption, in whole or in part, from this section, whether or not such exemption is codified.</p>

<p>Beginning in calendar year 2018, every person claiming a tax preference that requires an annual tax performance report under this section must file a complete annual report with the department. The report is due by May 31st of the year following any calendar year in which a person becomes eligible to claim the tax preference that requires a report under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the tax preference is a deferral of tax, the first annual tax performance report must be filed by May 31st of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the investment project is certified by the department as operationally complete, and an annual tax performance report must be filed by May 31st of each of the seven succeeding calendar years.</p>

The report must not include names of employees. The report must also detail employment by the total number of full-time, part-time, and temporary positions for the year that the tax preference was claimed. In lieu of reporting employment and wage data required under this subsection, taxpayers may instead opt to allow the employment security department to release the same employment and wage information from unemployment insurance records to the department and the joint legislative audit and review committee. This option is intended to reduce the reporting burden for taxpayers, and each taxpayer electing to use this option must affirm that election in accordance with procedures approved by the employment security department.</p>
