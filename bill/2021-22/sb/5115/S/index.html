<blockquote>
<p>This section adds a new section to an existing chapter <a href="/rcw/51_industrial_insurance/51.32_compensation%E2%80%94right_to_and_amount.html">51.32</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/51_industrial_insurance/51.32_compensation%E2%80%94right_to_and_amount.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For frontline employees who are covered under this title, there exists a prima facie presumption that any infectious or contagious diseases that are transmitted through respiratory droplets or aerosols, or through contact with contaminated surfaces and are the subject of a public health emergency are occupational diseases under RCW 51.08.140 during a public health emergency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The frontline employee must provide verification, as required by the department by rule, to the department and the self-insured employer that the employee has contracted the infectious or contagious disease that is the subject of the public health emergency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This presumption of occupational disease may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The exposure to the infectious or contagious disease which is the subject of the public health emergency occurred from other employment or nonemployment activities; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The employee was working from the employee's home, on leave from the employee's employment, or some combination thereof, for the period of quarantine consistent with recommended guidance from state and federal health officials for the disease immediately prior to the employee's injury, occupational disease, or period of incapacity that resulted from exposure to the disease which is the subject of the public health emergency.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>RCW 51.32.090(7) does not apply to an occupational disease under this section except that no worker shall receive compensation for or during the day on which the occupational disease was contracted. For the purposes of this subsection (4), the day on which the occupational disease was contracted is whichever date occurs first of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The date that the worker first missed work due to symptoms of the infectious or contagious disease;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The date the worker was quarantined by a medical provider or public health official; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The date the worker received a positive test result confirming contraction of the infectious or contagious disease.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>When a determination involving the presumption established in this section is appealed to the board of industrial insurance appeals and the final decision allows the claim of benefits, the board of industrial insurance appeals shall order that all reasonable costs of the appeal, including attorneys' fees and witness fees, be paid to the worker or the worker's beneficiary by the opposing party. If the opposing party is a state fund employer, the costs and fees are paid by the employer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a determination involving the presumption established in this section is appealed to any court and the final decision allows the claim for benefits, the court shall order that all reasonable costs of appeal, including attorneys' fees and witness fees, be paid to the worker or the worker's beneficiary by the opposing party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When reasonable costs of the appeal must be paid by the department under this section in a state fund case, the costs shall be paid from the accident fund and charged to the costs of the claim. When calculating assessments due to the department for which total claim costs are the basis, self-insured employers and self-insurance hospital groups formed under RCW 51.14.150 and 51.14.160 may deduct the cost of payments made under this section from the total of all claim costs reported.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Costs of the payments under this section shall not affect the experience rating of employers insured by the state fund. These costs shall be paid from the accident fund.</p>
