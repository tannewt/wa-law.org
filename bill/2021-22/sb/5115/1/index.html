<ol>
<li>
<p>For frontline employees who are covered under this title, there exists a prima facie presumption that any infectious or contagious diseases which are the subject of a public health emergency are occupational diseases under RCW 51.08.140 during a public health emergency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The frontline employee must provide verification, as required by the department by rule, to the department and the self-insured employer that the employee has contracted the infectious or contagious disease that is the subject of the public health emergency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This presumption of occupational disease may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The exposure to the infectious or contagious disease which is the subject of the public health emergency occurred from other employment or nonemployment activities; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The employee was working from the employee's home, on leave from the employee's employment, or some combination thereof, for a period of 14 or more consecutive days immediately prior to the employee's injury, occupational disease, or period of incapacity resulted from exposure to the disease which is the subject of the public health emergency.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>RCW 51.32.090(7) does not apply to an occupational disease under this section except that no worker shall receive compensation for or during the day on which the occupational disease was contracted. For the purposes of this section, &quot;contracted&quot; means whichever date occurs first of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The date that the worker first missed work due to symptoms of the infectious or contagious disease;</p>
</li>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>When a determination involving the presumption established in this section is appealed to the board of industrial insurance appeals and the final decision allows the claim of benefits, the board of industrial insurance appeals shall order that all reasonable costs of the appeal, including attorneys' fees and witness fees, be paid to the worker or the worker's beneficiary by the opposing party. If the opposing party is a state fund employer, the costs and fees are paid by the employer.</p>

<li>
<p>When a determination involving the presumption established in this section is appealed to any court and the final decision allows the claim for benefits, the court shall order that all reasonable costs of appeal, including attorneys' fees and witness fees, be paid to the worker or the worker's beneficiary by the opposing party.</p>

<li>
<p>During a public health emergency, if an employer requires its employees or contractors to wear personal protective equipment, such as gloves, goggles, face shields, or face masks, the employer must provide the required equipment at no cost to the employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every employer that does not have a requirement for its employees and contractors to wear personal protective equipment subject to subsection (1) of this section, must accommodate its employee's or contractor's voluntary use of protective devices or equipment, including gloves, goggles, face shields, and face masks, as the employee or contractor deems necessary, during a public health emergency, as long as:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The use of these protective devices and equipment does not introduce hazards to the work environment and is consistent with the provisions of chapter 49.17 RCW and corresponding rules established by the department, as of the effective date of this section; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of facial coverings does not interfere with an employer's security requirements.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the citation and notice of assessment, the director may order payment to the department of a civil penalty. For purposes of a civil penalty for violation of RCW 49.58.020 and 49.58.050, the violation as to each affected employee constitutes a separate violation.</p>
<ol type="i">

<p>For a first violation, the civil penalty may not exceed five hundred dollars.</p>
