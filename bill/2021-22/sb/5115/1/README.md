(f) The right to bring a whistleblower action under this section may not be impaired by any private agreement.

## Section 16
(1) In addition to the requirements of RCW 49.46.210 and section 14 of this act, every employer, with 50 or more employees, shall provide each of its employees 12 weeks of emergency child care leave on an annual basis, in the amounts specified in subsection (2) of this section, during a public health emergency when the employee is absent or unable to work or telework when the employee is caring for a child of the employee because the child's school or place of care has been closed, or the child's child care provider is unavailable, due to a public health emergency. For the purposes of this section, a school is closed when the school does not allow the child to physically attend class in person for the full day.
(2)(a) The first 10 days of leave taken under this section shall be unpaid leave; however, the employee may substitute any paid time off offered by an employer under the employer's established policy.
(b) For each hour of emergency child care leave that is paid leave under this section, an employee shall be paid at least two-thirds of the employee's normal hourly compensation or salary, not to exceed $200 per day or an aggregate of $10,000 annually.
(3) Emergency child care leave under this section shall not carry over to a subsequent year.
(4) An employee is entitled to use the emergency child care leave provided in this section after 90 days of employment with the employer, with no restriction on the minimum number of hours worked.
(5) Employers are not prevented from providing more generous paid leave policies than provided in this section.
(6) This section does not require an employer to provide financial or other reimbursement for accrued and unused emergency child care leave to any employee upon the employee's termination, resignation, retirement, or other separation from employment.
(7)(a) An employer may require employees to give reasonable notice of an absence from work, so long as such notice does not interfere with an employee's lawful use of emergency child care leave.
(b) For absences exceeding three days, an employer may require verification that an employee's use of emergency child care leave is for an authorized purpose. If an employer requires verification, verification must be provided to the employer within a reasonable time period during or after the leave. An employer's requirements for verification may not result in an unreasonable burden or expense on the employee and may not exceed privacy or verification requirements otherwise established by law.
(c) An employer may not require, as a condition of an employee taking emergency child care leave, that the employee search for or find a replacement worker to cover the hours during which the employee is on paid leave.
(d) The employer is responsible for providing regular notification to employees about the amount of emergency child care leave available to the employee.
(8) An employer may not adopt or enforce any policy that counts the use of emergency child care leave time as an absence that may lead to or result in discipline against the employee.
(9) An employer may not discriminate or retaliate against an employee for the employee's exercise of any rights under this chapter, including the use of emergency child care leave.
(10) The department may enforce the provisions of this section under the provisions of chapter 49.46 RCW and the corresponding rules established by the department.
