<li>
<p>The department, in collaboration with tribal governments and community and statewide partners, shall implement a quality rating and improvement system, called the early achievers program. The early achievers program provides a foundation of quality for the early care and education system. The early achievers program is applicable to licensed or certified child care centers <strong>, family home child care, outdoor nature-based child care,</strong> and early learning programs such as working connections child care and early childhood education and assistance programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The objectives of the early achievers program are to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Improve short-term and long-term educational outcomes for children as measured by assessments including, but not limited to, the Washington kindergarten inventory of developing skills in RCW 28A.655.080;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give parents clear and easily accessible information about the quality of child care and early education programs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support improvement in early learning and child care programs throughout the state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase the readiness of children for school;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close the disparities in access to quality care;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide professional development and coaching opportunities to early child care and education providers; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish a common set of expectations and standards that define, measure, and improve the quality of early learning and child care settings.</p>

A license or continuation shall be granted if the agency meets the minimum requirements set forth in this chapter and the departmental requirements consistent with this chapter, except that an initial license may be issued as provided in RCW 43.216.315. The department shall consider whether an agency is in good standing, as defined in subsection (4)(b) of this section, before granting a continuation of a full license. Full licenses provided for in this chapter shall continue to remain valid so long as the licensee meets the requirements for a nonexpiring license in subsection (2) of this section and may be transferred to a new licensee in the event of a transfer of ownership of a child care operation. The licensee, however, shall advise the secretary of any material change in circumstances which might constitute grounds for reclassification of license as to category. The license issued under this chapter applies only to the licensee and the location stated in the application. For licensed family day care homes having an acceptable history of child care, the license may remain in effect for two weeks after a move.</p>

<p>Recognize the family as the most important social and economic unit of society and support the central role parents play in child rearing. All parents are encouraged to care for and nurture their children through the traditional methods of parental care at home.

Parents are encouraged to participate fully in the effort to improve the quality of child care services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote a variety of culturally and developmentally appropriate child care settings and services of the highest possible quality in accordance with the basic principle of continuity of care. These settings shall include, but not be limited to, family day care homes, <strong>outdoor nature-based child care</strong>, centers**,** and schools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote the growth, development and safety of children by working with community groups including providers and parents to establish standards for quality service, training of child care providers, fair and equitable monitoring, and salary levels commensurate with provider responsibilities and support services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote equal access to quality, affordable, socio-economically integrated child care for all children and families.</p>

<p>Facilitate broad community and private sector involvement in the provision of quality child care services to foster economic development and assist industry through the department.</p>
