<p>By January 1, 2025, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must provide an analysis of school district transportation costs and allocations following the 2023-24 school year to the education and fiscal committees of the legislature. This analysis must include the mileage, ridership, and costs for each district, disaggregated by the following student demographic categories: (1) Students requiring special transportation due to a properly formed and approved individualized education program; (2) students requiring special transportation due to requirements of the McKinney-Vento act or other federal program; (3) students requiring special transportation due to a foster care placement out of their regular school district boundary; and (4) all other students transported to and from school. The legislature intends to use this data to inform their future discussions on revising the overall student transportation allocation model to a more transparent and predictable funding model.</p>
