# Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 5096 as Recommended by Ways & Means

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5096-S.E.xml)
## Section 101
(1) The legislature recognizes that a tax system that is fair, balanced, and works for everyone is essential to help all Washingtonians grow and thrive. But Washington's tax system today is the most regressive in the nation because it asks those making the least to pay the most as a percentage of their income. Middle-income families in Washington pay two to four times more in taxes, as a percentage of household income, as compared to top earners in the state. Low-income Washingtonians pay at least six times more than do our wealthiest residents. To begin to rebalance the tax code, the legislature intends to enact an excise tax on the sale of certain capital assets.
(2) The excise tax on capital gains is a tax on the one-time, voluntary sale or exchange of a capital asset, not a tax on ownership of the asset itself. This excise tax is paid only by those individuals who engage in voluntary sales or exchanges of Washington capital assets, either directly or indirectly through their ownership interest in an entity that engages in voluntary sales or exchanges of Washington capital assets, and is measured by the realization of significant net gain on the aggregate of such transactions during the taxable year. In order to protect against further regressive impacts of the tax system, encourage the everyday investments that Washingtonians of all income levels strive for, and support our economy, this excise tax will not apply to capital gains realized by certain sales and transfers.
(3) To help meet the state's obligations to its people, the legislature dedicates the first $350,000,000 in revenue collected from this excise tax to the state's education legacy trust account. This funding is critically needed to provide support for education, especially early learning and child care, and to provide for the economic security of low-income households who are struggling to afford quality child care and preschool. Furthermore, the legislature finds that increasing taxes on the wealthiest residents is only one-half of the effort to rebalance the tax code. In an effort to both reduce the tax burden on those earning the least and to account for anticipated volatility in revenue collections from the capital gains excise tax, revenue received above base levels will be deposited into the taxpayer fairness account. Revenues deposited in this account will be used to offset existing tax burdens via policies such as funding of the working families' tax exemption.

## Section 102
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.
(1) "Adjusted capital gain" means federal net long-term capital gain:
(a) Plus any amount of long-term capital loss from a sale or exchange that is exempt from the tax imposed in this chapter, to the extent such loss was included in calculating federal net long-term capital gain;

(e) Less any amount of long-term capital gain from a sale or exchange that is exempt from the tax imposed in this chapter, to the extent such gain was included in calculating federal net long-term capital gain.
(2) "Capital asset" has the same meaning as provided by Title 26 U.S.C. Sec. 1221 of the internal revenue code and also includes any other property if the sale or exchange of the property results in a gain that is treated as a long-term capital gain under Title 26 U.S.C. Sec. 1231 or any other provision of the internal revenue code.
(3) "Federal net long-term capital gain" means the net long-term capital gain reportable for federal income tax purposes determined as if Title 26 U.S.C. Secs. 55 through 59, 1400Z-1, and 1400Z-2 of the internal revenue code did not exist.
(4) "Individual" means a natural person.
(5) "Internal revenue code" means the United States internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, as of the effective date of this section, or such subsequent date as the department may provide by rule consistent with the purpose of this chapter.

(7) "Long-term capital gain" means gain from the sale or exchange of a long-term capital asset.
(8) "Long-term capital loss" means a loss from the sale or exchange of a long-term capital asset.
(9) "Real estate" has the same meaning as in RCW 82.45.032, except that real estate does not include an individual's ownership interest or beneficial interest in an entity which itself owns an interest in real property located in this state for the purposes of this chapter.
(10)(a) "Resident" means an individual:
(i) Who is domiciled in this state during the taxable year, unless the individual (A) maintained no permanent place of abode in this state during the entire taxable year, (B) maintained a permanent place of abode outside of this state during the entire taxable year, and (C) spent in the aggregate not more than 30 days of the taxable year in this state; or

## Section 103
(1) Beginning January 1, 2022, an excise tax is imposed on the sale or exchange of long-term capital assets. Only individuals are subject to payment of the tax, which equals seven percent multiplied by an individual's Washington capital gains.
(2) If an individual's Washington capital gains are less than zero for a taxable year, no tax is due under this section and no such amount is allowed as a carryover for use in the calculation of that individual's adjusted capital gain, as defined in section 102(1) of this act, for any taxable year. To the extent that a loss carryforward is included in the calculation of an individual's federal net long-term capital gain and that loss carryforward is directly attributable to losses from sales or exchanges allocated to this state under section 108 of this act, the loss carryforward is included in the calculation of that individual's adjusted capital gain for the purposes of this chapter. An individual may not include any losses carried back for federal income tax purposes in the calculation of that individual's adjusted capital gain for any taxable year.
(3)(a) The tax imposed in this section applies to the sale or exchange of long-term capital assets owned by the taxpayer, whether the taxpayer was the legal or beneficial owner of such assets at the time of the sale or exchange. The tax applies when the Washington capital gains are recognized by the taxpayer in accordance with this chapter.
(b) For purposes of this chapter:
(i) An individual is considered to be a beneficial owner of long-term capital assets held by an entity that is a pass-through or disregarded entity for federal tax purposes, such as a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation, or grantor trust, to the extent of the individual's ownership interest in the entity as reported for federal income tax purposes.
(ii) A nongrantor trust is deemed to be a grantor trust if the trust does not qualify as a grantor trust for federal tax purposes, and the grantor's transfer of assets to the trust is treated as an incomplete gift under Title 26 U.S.C. Sec. 2511 of the internal revenue code and its accompanying regulations. A grantor of such trust is considered the beneficial owner of the capital assets of the trust for purposes of the tax imposed in this section and must include any long-term capital gain or loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset by the trust in the calculation of that individual's adjusted capital gain, if such gain or loss is allocated to this state under section 108 of this act.

## Section 104
This chapter does not apply to the sale or exchange of:
(1) All real estate;
(2) A controlling interest in an entity only to the extent that any long-term capital gain or loss from such sale or exchange is directly attributable to the entity's interest in real property and the sale or exchange was subject to tax under chapter 82.45 RCW. The department is not bound by the parties' agreement as to the allocation of consideration or fair market value, if such allocation or fair market value does not reflect the fair market value of the real property. For purposes of this subsection (2), "controlling interest" has the same meaning as in RCW 82.45.033;

(5) Cattle, horses, or breeding livestock if for the taxable year of the sale or exchange, more than 50 percent of the taxpayer's gross income for the taxable year, including from the sale or exchange of capital assets, is from farming or ranching;
(6) Property depreciable under Title 26 U.S.C. Sec. 167(a)(1) of the internal revenue code, or that qualifies for expensing under Title 26 U.S.C. Sec. 179 of the internal revenue code;

"Timber" means forest trees, standing or down, on privately or publicly owned land, and includes Christmas trees and short-rotation hardwoods. The sale or exchange of timber includes the cutting or disposal of timber qualifying for capital gains treatment under Title 26 U.S.C. Sec. 631(a) or (b) of the internal revenue code; and
(8) Goodwill received from the sale of an auto dealership licensed under chapter 46.70 RCW whose activities are subject to chapter 46.96 RCW.

(a) Long-term capital gains or losses from the sale or exchange of tangible personal property are allocated to this state if the property was located in this state at the time of the sale or exchange. Long-term capital gains or losses from the sale or exchange of tangible personal property are also allocated to this state even though the property was not located in this state at the time of the sale or exchange if:

(b) As used in this section, "taxing jurisdiction" means a state of the United States other than the state of Washington, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or possession of the United States, or any foreign country or political subdivision of a foreign country.

## Section 109

An extension under this subsection for the filing of a return under this chapter is not an extension of time to pay the tax due under this chapter.
(6)(a) If any return due under subsection (1) of this section, along with a copy of the federal income tax return, is not filed with the department by the due date or any extension granted by the department, the department must assess a penalty in the amount of five percent of the tax due for the taxable year covered by the return for each month or portion of a month that the return remains unfiled. The total penalty assessed under this subsection may not exceed 25 percent of the tax due for the taxable year covered by the delinquent return. The penalty under this subsection is in addition to any penalties assessed for the late payment of any tax due on the return.

(1) If the federal income tax liabilities of both spouses are determined on a joint federal return for the taxable year, they must file a joint return under this chapter.
(2) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if the federal income tax liability of either spouse is determined on a separate federal return for the taxable year, they must file separate returns under this chapter. State registered domestic partners may file a joint return under this chapter even if they filed separate federal returns for the taxable year.
(3) In any case in which a joint return is filed under this section, the liability of each spouse or state registered domestic partner is joint and several, unless:
(a) The spouse is relieved of liability for federal tax purposes as provided under Title 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6015 of the internal revenue code; or

## Section 111
Except as otherwise provided by law and to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, chapter 82.32 RCW applies to the administration of taxes imposed under this chapter.

If an adjustment under this subsection (1) would reduce the applicable amounts, the department must not adjust the applicable amounts for use in the following year. The department must publish the adjusted applicable amounts on its public website by December 31st. The adjusted applicable amounts calculated under this subsection (1) take effect for taxes due and distributions made, as the case may be, in the following calendar year.
(2) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
(a) "Applicable amounts" means:
(i) The threshold exclusion under section 102(13) of this act;

Any credits previously claimed under section 113 of this act must be repaid within 30 days of the department of revenue's notice to the taxpayer of the amount due.
(2) If the taxpayer fails to repay the credit by the due date, interest and penalties as provided in chapter 82.32 RCW apply to the deficiency.

If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.
