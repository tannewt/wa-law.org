<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/46_motor_vehicles/46.20_drivers_licenses%E2%80%94identicards.html">46.20.245</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/46_motor_vehicles/46.20_drivers_licenses%E2%80%94identicards.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Whenever the department proposes to withhold the driving privilege of a person or disqualify a person from operating a commercial motor vehicle and this action is made mandatory by the provisions of this chapter or other law, the department must give notice to the person in writing by posting in the United States mail, appropriately addressed, postage prepaid, or by personal service. Notice by mail is given upon deposit in the United States mail. Notice given under this subsection must specify the date upon which the driving privilege is to be withheld which shall not be less than <strong>90</strong> days after the original notice is given. <strong>Notice by mail must also include the following:</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p><strong>An advisory of payment options including payment plan opportunities that are available;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Community service opportunities that are available; and</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The department website address required under RCW 46.63.110.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For persons subject to suspension, revocation, or denial of a driver's license who are eligible for full credit under RCW 46.61.5055(9)(b)(ii), the notice in subsection (1) of this section must also notify the person of the obligation to complete the requirements under RCW 46.20.311 and pay the probationary license fee under RCW 46.20.355 by the date specified in the notice in order to avoid license suspension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within <strong>30</strong> days after notice has been given to a person under subsection (1) of this section, the person may request in writing an administrative review before the department. If the request is mailed, it must be postmarked within <strong>30</strong> days after the date the department has given notice. If a person fails to request an administrative review within <strong>30</strong> days after the date the department gives notice, the person is considered to have defaulted and loses his or her right to an administrative review unless the department finds good cause for a request after the <strong>30-day</strong> period.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>An administrative review under this subsection shall consist solely of an internal review of documents and records submitted or available to the department, unless the person requests an interview before the department, in which case all or any part of the administrative review may, at the discretion of the department, be conducted by telephone or other electronic means.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only issues to be addressed in the administrative review are:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Whether the records relied on by the department identify the correct person; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the information transmitted from the court or other reporting agency or entity regarding the person accurately describes the action taken by the court or other reporting agency or entity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, the notice received from a court or other reporting agency or entity, regardless of form or format, is prima facie evidence that the information from the court or other reporting agency or entity regarding the person is accurate. A person requesting administrative review has the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the person is not subject to the withholding of the driving privilege.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The action subject to the notification requirements of subsection (1) of this section shall be stayed during the administrative review process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Judicial review of a department order affirming the action subject to the notification requirements of subsection (1) of this section after an administrative review shall be available in the same manner as provided in RCW 46.20.308(8). The department shall certify its record to the court within <strong>30</strong> days after service upon the department of the petition for judicial review. The action subject to the notification requirements of subsection (1) of this section shall not automatically be stayed during the judicial review. If judicial relief is sought for a stay or other temporary remedy from the department's action, the court shall not grant relief unless the court finds that the appellant is likely to prevail in the appeal and that without a stay the appellant will suffer irreparable injury.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may adopt rules that are considered necessary or convenient by the department for purposes of administering this section, including, but not limited to, rules regarding expedited procedures for issuing orders and expedited notice procedures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not apply where an opportunity for an informal settlement, driver improvement interview, or formal hearing is otherwise provided by law or rule of the department.</p>
</li>
</ol>
