<ol>
<li>
<p>A political subdivision <strong>commits vote dilution and shall be found</strong> in violation of this chapter when it is shown that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Elections in the political subdivision exhibit polarized voting; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Members of a protected class or classes do not have an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice as a result of the dilution or abridgment of the rights of members of that protected class or classes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A violation is presumptively established if:</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p><strong>It is shown that the political subdivision used race, ethnicity, or language-minority group status, or another characteristic that serves as a proxy for race, ethnicity, or language-minority group status, for the purpose of apportionment. A political subdivision may only rebut this presumption by showing that race, ethnicity, or language-minority group status, or another characteristic that serves as a proxy for race, ethnicity, or language-minority group status, was used to the extent necessary to comply with this chapter, the federal voting rights act, the state Constitution, or the United States Constitution; or</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The electoral district boundaries of the political subdivision &quot;crack&quot; or &quot;pack&quot; minority communities of interest, regardless of intent, and that such &quot;cracking&quot; or &quot;packing&quot; was not necessary to comply with this title, the federal voting rights act, the state Constitution, or the United States Constitution.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No single factor is dispositive or necessary to establish a violation of this section. The equal opportunity to elect shall be assessed pragmatically, based on local election conditions, and may include crossover districts.</strong> The <strong>following factors</strong> shall not preclude a finding of a violation under this chapter, but may be  factor<strong>s</strong> in determining a remedy**:**</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p><strong>That members of a protected class are not geographically compact or concentrated to constitute a majority in a proposed or existing district-based election district; and</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evidence concerning projected changes in population or demographics</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining whether there is polarized voting under this chapter, the court shall analyze elections of the governing body of the political subdivision, ballot measure elections, elections in which at least one candidate is a member of a protected class, and other electoral choices that affect the rights and privileges of members of a protected class. Elections conducted prior to the filing of an action pursuant to this chapter are more probative to establish the existence of  polarized voting than elections conducted after the filing of an action**. Evidence concerning elections of the governing body of the political subdivision is more probative than evidence concerning other elections. Statistical evidence is more probative to establish the existence of polarized voting than nonstatistical evidence**.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The election of candidates who are members of a protected class and who were elected prior to the filing of an action pursuant to this chapter shall not preclude a finding of polarized voting that results in an unequal opportunity for a protected class to elect candidates of their choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proof of intent on the part of the voters or elected officials to discriminate against a protected class is not required for a cause of action to be sustained.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other factors <strong>which are probative to establish a violation of this chapter include, but are not limited to:</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p><strong>The extent of the</strong> history of <strong>official voting</strong> discrimination<strong>in the political subdivision;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The extent to which the political subdivision has used</strong> voting practices or procedures that may enhance the dilutive effects of at large elections<strong>or tend to enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the members of the protected class;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Denial</strong> of access to those processes determining which groups of candidates will receive financial or other support in a given election**;**</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The extent to which members of the protected class contribute to political campaigns at lower rates;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The extent to which members of the protected class vote at lower rates than other members of the electorate;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The</strong> extent to which members of a protected class bear the effects of past discrimination in areas such as education, employment,  health**, criminal justice, housing, land use, and environmental protection**, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process**;**</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The extent to which members of the protected class are otherwise disadvantaged in ways which may hinder their ability to participate in the political process;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The</strong> use of overt or subtle racial appeals in political campaigns <strong>;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A significant lack of responsiveness on the part of elected officials to the particularized needs of the protected class; and</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Whether the political subdivision lacks a compelling policy justification for adopting or maintaining the method of election narrowly tailored to the political subdivision's interests or whether a less biased law would not significantly impair the compelling policy justification</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evidence of the factors listed in subsection (7) of this section concerning the state, private actors, or other political subdivisions in the geographic region may be considered but is less probative than evidence concerning the political subdivision itself.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The use of partisanship or characteristics associated with partisanship cannot be used as a defense to a claim under this chapter.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evidence of the following is not probative in terms of establishing a defense to a claim under this chapter:</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p><strong>The size of the burden on members of the protected class;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>That the political jurisdiction's voting rules were adopted prior to this chapter's enactment or the level of deviation from standard practice when this chapter was enacted;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The size of any disparities in a rule's impact on members of different racial or ethnic groups;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Additional avenues available to the protected class to vote; and</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>That the voting rules are facially neutral in time, place, or manner.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A class of citizens protected by this subsection may include a cohesive coalition of members of different racial, ethnic, or language minority groups.</strong></p>

<p>The court may order appropriate remedies including, but not limited to, the imposition of a district-based election system. The court may order the affected jurisdiction to draw or redraw district boundaries or appoint an individual or panel to draw or redraw district lines. The proposed districts must be approved by the court prior to their implementation. <strong>The court may not approve a remedy that has a dilutive effect on the protected class.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementation of a district-based remedy is not precluded by the fact that members of a protected class do not constitute a numerical majority within a proposed district-based election district. If, in tailoring a remedy, the court orders the implementation of a district-based election district where the members of the protected class are not a numerical majority, the court shall do so in a manner that provides the protected class an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice. The court may also approve a district-based election system that provides the protected class the opportunity to join in a coalition of two or more protected classes to elect candidates of their choice if there is demonstrated political cohesion among the protected classes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In tailoring a remedy after a finding of a violation of RCW 29A.92.020:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If the court's order providing a remedy or approving proposed districts, whichever is later, is issued during the period of time between the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November and on or before January 15th of the following year, the court shall order new elections, conducted pursuant to the remedy, to occur at the next succeeding general election. If a special filing period is required, filings for that office shall be reopened for a period of three business days, such three-day period to be fixed by the filing officer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court's order providing a remedy or approving proposed districts, whichever is later, is issued during the period of time between January 16th and on or before the first Monday of November, the next election will occur as scheduled and organized under the current electoral system, but the court shall order new elections to occur pursuant to the remedy at the general election the following calendar year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The remedy may provide for the political subdivision to hold elections for the members of its governing body at the same time as regularly scheduled elections for statewide or federal offices. All positions on the governing body must stand for election at the next election for the governing body, scheduled pursuant to this subsection (3). The governing body may subsequently choose to stagger the terms of its positions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within thirty days of the conclusion of any action filed under RCW 29A.92.100, the political subdivision must publish on the subdivision's website, the outcome and summary of the action, as well as the legal costs incurred by the subdivision. If the political subdivision does not have its own website, then it may publish on the county website.</p>

If the attorney general affirmatively indicates that no objection will be made within the 60-day period following the receipt of the governing body's submission, the attorney general may reserve the right to reexamine the submission if additional information that would otherwise require objection in accordance with this section comes to his or her attention during the remainder of the 60-day period.

e. For any covered policy concerning the establishment of a district-based election system, apportionment plans, or a change to the form of government of a political subdivision, the attorney general may invoke up to two extensions of 90 days each.
