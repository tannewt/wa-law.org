</li>
<li>
<p>Have power to administer oaths or affirmations necessary in the discharge of their duties and commit for contempt any witness refusing to testify before them with the same power as district judges;</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>After bids that are submitted in response to a competitive solicitation process are reviewed by the awarding county, the awarding county may:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Reject all bids and rebid or cancel the competitive solicitation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request best and final offers from responsive and responsible bidders; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Award the purchase or contract to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county may award one or more contracts from a competitive solicitation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining whether the bidder is a responsible bidder, the county must consider the following elements:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The ability, capacity, and skill of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service required;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience, and efficiency of the bidder;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the bidder can perform the contract within the time specified;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The quality of performance of previous contracts or services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with laws relating to the contract or services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether, within the three-year period immediately preceding the date of the bid solicitation, the bidder has been determined by a final and binding citation and notice of assessment issued by the department of labor and industries or through a civil judgment entered by a court of limited or general jurisdiction to have willfully violated, as defined in RCW 49.48.082, any provision of chapter 49.46, 49.48, or 49.52 RCW; and</p>

<li>
<p>Such other information as may be secured having a bearing on the decision to award the contract.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Due to the unique aspects of electric ferry design and the importance of well-integrated ship and shore equipment, in determining the lowest responsive and responsible bidder for the design and procurement of an electric ferry, a county may consider best value criteria, including but not limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Whether the bid satisfies the needs of the county as specified in the solicitation documents;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the bid encourages diverse contractor participation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the bid provides competitive pricing, economies, and efficiencies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the bid considers human health and environmental impacts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the bid appropriately weighs cost and noncost considerations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Life-cycle cost;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project manager capabilities, including subcontractor management;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proposed approach to overall project plan, including integration, commissioning, and acceptance testing; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demonstrated contractor and subcontractor technical knowledge or specific technical capabilities to meet technical elements of the design specified in the bid documents.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The solicitation document must clearly set forth the requirements and criteria that the contract will apply in evaluating bid submissions. Before award of a contract, a bidder shall submit to the contracting county a signed statement in accordance with chapter 5.50 RCW verifying under penalty of perjury that the bidder is in compliance with the responsible bidder criteria requirement of subsection (2)(f) of this section. A contracting county may award a contract in reasonable reliance upon such a sworn statement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The awarding county may at its discretion reject the bid of any contractor who has failed to perform satisfactorily on a previous contract with the county.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After reviewing all bid submissions, a county may enter into negotiations with the lowest responsive and responsible bidder in order to determine if the bid may be improved. A county may not use this negotiation opportunity to permit a bidder to change a nonresponsive bid into a responsive bid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in (a) of this subsection, all proceedings, records, contracts, and other public records relating to electric ferry design and procurement under this chapter shall be open to the inspection of any interested person, firm, or corporation in accordance with chapter 42.56 RCW.</p>

<li>
<p>All documents related to a procurement under chapter 224, Laws of 2021 are exempt from disclosure until the notification of the highest scoring finalist is made or the selection process is terminated.</p>

<li>
<p>Where critical equipment selections can be made to mature a ferry design, reducing cost and performance risk in shipyard contracts, these selections may be made and the chosen vendors specified by name in bid specifications without allowing substitutions. Counties and their consultants may evaluate cost and noncost considerations when making these selections provided that the selection is made in good faith to identify the equipment best suited to the county's needs.</p>

<p>No contract for public works may be entered into by the county legislative authority or by any elected or appointed officer of the county until after bids have been submitted to the county upon specifications therefor. Such specifications shall be in writing and shall be filed with the clerk of the county legislative authority for public inspection. An advertisement shall be published in the county official newspaper stating the time and place where bids will be opened, the time after which bids will not be received, the character of the work to be done, the materials and equipment to be furnished, and that specifications therefor may be seen at the office of the clerk of the county legislative authority. An advertisement shall also be published in a legal newspaper of general circulation in or as near as possible to that part of the county in which such work is to be done. If the county official newspaper is a newspaper of general circulation covering at least forty percent of the residences in that part of the county in which such public works are to be done, then the publication of an advertisement of the applicable specifications in the county official newspaper shall be sufficient. Such advertisements shall be published at least once at least thirteen days prior to the last date upon which bids will be received. The bids shall be in writing, shall be filed with the clerk, shall be opened and read in public at the time and place named therefor in the advertisements, and after being opened, shall be filed for public inspection. No bid may be considered for public work unless it is accompanied by a bid deposit in the form of a surety bond, postal money order, cash, cashier's check, or certified check in an amount equal to five percent of the amount of the bid proposed. The contract for the public work shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder. Any or all bids may be rejected for good cause. The county legislative authority shall require from the successful bidder for such public work a contractor's bond in the amount and with the conditions imposed by law. If the bidder to whom the contract is awarded fails to enter into the contract and furnish the contractor's bond as required within ten days after notice of the award, exclusive of the day of notice, the amount of the bid deposit shall be forfeited to the county and the contract awarded to the next lowest and best bidder. A low bidder who claims error and fails to enter into a contract is prohibited from bidding on the same project if a second or subsequent call for bids is made for the project. The bid deposit of all unsuccessful bidders shall be returned after the contract is awarded and the required contractor's bond given by the successful bidder is accepted by the county legislative authority. In the letting of any contract for public works involving less than forty thousand dollars, advertisement and competitive bidding may be dispensed with on order of the county legislative authority. Immediately after the award is made, the bid quotations obtained shall be recorded and open to public inspection and shall be available by telephone inquiry.</p>
