<p>The legislature finds that electoral systems that deny race, color, or language minority groups an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice are inconsistent with the right to free and equal elections as provided by Article I, section 19 and Article VI, section 1 of the Washington state Constitution as well as protections found in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments to the United States Constitution. The well-established principle of &quot;one person, one vote&quot; and the prohibition on vote dilution have been consistently upheld in federal and state courts for more than fifty years.</p>
<p>The legislature also finds that local government subdivisions are often prohibited from addressing these challenges because of Washington laws that narrowly prescribe the methods by which they may elect members of their legislative bodies. The legislature finds that in some cases, this has resulted in an improper dilution of voting power for these minority groups. The legislature intends to modify existing prohibitions in state laws so that these jurisdictions may voluntarily adopt changes on their own, in collaboration with affected community members, to remedy potential electoral issues so that minority groups have an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice or influence the outcome of an election.</p>
<p>The legislature intends for this chapter to be consistent with federal protections that may provide a similar remedy for minority groups. Remedies shall also be available where the drawing of crossover and coalition districts is able to address both vote dilution and racial polarization.</p>
<p>The legislature also intends for this chapter to be consistent with legal precedent from Mt. Spokane Skiing Corp. v. Spokane Co. (86 Wn. App. 165, 1997) that found that noncharter counties need not adhere to a single uniform county system of government, but that each county have the same &quot;authority available&quot; in order to be deemed uniform.</p>

<p>The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise. In applying these definitions and other terms in this chapter, courts may rely on relevant federal case law for guidance <strong>to the extent such case law does not violate the spirit, intent, and elements of this chapter</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&quot;At large election&quot; means any of the following methods of electing members of the governing body of a political subdivision:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>One in which the voters of the entire jurisdiction elect the members to the governing body;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One in which the candidates are required to reside within given areas of the jurisdiction and the voters of the entire jurisdiction elect the members to the governing body; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One that combines the criteria in (a) and (b) of this subsection or one that combines at large with district-based elections.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&quot;Crossover district&quot; means a district where a protected class is a minority of the population but potentially large enough to elect candidates of choice with help from voters who are not members of the protected class who cross over to support a protected class's candidate of choice.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;District-based elections&quot; means a method of electing members to the governing body of a political subdivision in which the candidate must reside within an election district that is a divisible part of the political subdivision and is elected only by voters residing within that election district.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&quot;Federal voting rights act&quot; means the federal voting rights act of 1965, 52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&quot;Plan of government&quot; has the meaning defined in RCW 35A.01.070 for cities operating under the optional municipal code, or the structure of elected officials serving executive and legislative functions in other jurisdictions.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Polarized voting&quot; means voting in which there is a difference, as defined in case law regarding enforcement of the federal voting rights act in the choice of candidates or other electoral choices that are preferred by voters in a protected class, and in the choice of candidates and electoral choices that are preferred by voters in the rest of the electorate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Political subdivision&quot; means any county, city, town, school district, fire protection district, port district, or public utility district, but does not include the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Protected class&quot; means a class of voters who are members of <strong>any</strong> race, color, or language**-**minority group, as this class is referenced and defined in the federal voting rights act.</p>

<p><strong>It is a violation of this chapter for a political subdivision to impose a method of electing its governing body that constitutes vote dilution as</strong> provided in RCW 29A.92.030.</p>
<h2 id="29a92030---violationsfactors"><strong>29A.92.030 - Violations—Factors.</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#29a92030---violationsfactors">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A political subdivision <strong>commits vote dilution and shall be found</strong> in violation of this chapter when it is shown that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Elections in the political subdivision exhibit polarized voting; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Members of a protected class or classes do not have an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice as a result of the dilution or abridgment of the rights of members of that protected class or classes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The equal opportunity to elect shall be assessed pragmatically, based on local election conditions, and may include crossover districts. No single factor is dispositive or necessary to establish a violation of this section.</strong> The fact that members of a protected class are not geographically compact or concentrated to constitute a majority in a proposed or existing district-based election district shall not preclude a finding of a violation under this chapter, but may be a factor in determining a remedy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining whether there is polarized voting under this chapter, the court shall analyze elections of the governing body of the political subdivision, ballot measure elections, elections in which at least one candidate is a member of a protected class, and other electoral choices that affect the rights and privileges of members of a protected class. Elections conducted prior to the filing of an action pursuant to this chapter are more probative to establish the existence of  polarized voting than elections conducted after the filing of an action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The election of candidates who are members of a protected class and who were elected prior to the filing of an action pursuant to this chapter shall not preclude a finding of polarized voting that results in an unequal opportunity for a protected class to elect candidates of their choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proof of intent on the part of the voters or elected officials to discriminate against a protected class is not required for a cause of action to be sustained.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other factors such as the history of discrimination, the use of electoral devices or other voting practices or procedures that may enhance the dilutive effects of at large elections, denial of access to those processes determining which groups of candidates will receive financial or other support in a given election, the extent to which members of a protected class bear the effects of past discrimination in areas such as education, employment, and health, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process, and the use of overt or subtle racial appeals in political campaigns are probative, but not necessary factors, to establish a violation of this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A class of citizens protected by this section may include a cohesive coalition of members of different racial, ethnic, or language minority groups.</strong></p>

<p><strong>After finding a violation of RCW 29A.92.020 or upon stipulation of the parties, the</strong> court may order appropriate remedies including, but not limited to, the imposition of a district-based election system. <strong>In tailoring a remedy, the court shall consider proposed remedies by the parties and may not give deference to a proposed remedy only because it is proposed by the political subdivision. The court may not approve a remedy that has a dilutive effect on the protected class.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If the court orders a district-based remedy, the court must approve proposed district boundaries prior to their implementation. The court must determine that the proposed district boundaries will not have a dilutive effect on the protected class before court approval.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementation of a district-based remedy is not precluded by the fact that members of a protected class do not constitute a numerical majority within a proposed district-based election district. If, in tailoring a remedy, the court orders the implementation of a district-based election district where the members of the protected class are not a numerical majority, the court shall do so in a manner that provides the protected class an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice. The court may also approve a district-based election system that provides the protected class the opportunity to join in a coalition of two or more protected classes to elect candidates of their choice if there is demonstrated political cohesion among the protected classes.</p>

If a special filing period is required, filings for that office shall be reopened for a period of three business days, such three-day period to be fixed by the filing officer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court's order providing a remedy or approving proposed districts, whichever is later, is issued during the period of time between January 16th and on or before the first Monday of November, the next election will occur as scheduled and organized under the current electoral system, but the court shall order new elections to occur pursuant to the remedy at the general election the following calendar year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The remedy may provide for the political subdivision to hold elections for the members of its governing body at the same time as regularly scheduled elections for statewide or federal offices. All positions on the governing body must stand for election at the next election for the governing body, scheduled pursuant to this subsection (4). The governing body may subsequently choose to stagger the terms of its positions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within thirty days of the conclusion of any action filed under RCW 29A.92.100, the political subdivision must publish on the subdivision's website, the outcome and summary of the action, as well as the legal costs incurred by the subdivision.
