<h2 id="section-1-841">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-841">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds it unconscionable that health care providers may misrepresent the source of the gametes provided to assisted reproduction patients. In such cases, false information leaves the children conceived through assisted reproduction without accurate information about their identity, family medical history, and true genetic parentage.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-666">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-666">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This section adds a new section to an existing chapter <a href="/rcw/18_businesses_and_professions/18.130_regulation_of_health_professions%E2%80%94uniform_disciplinary_act.html">18.130</a>.

<ol>
<li>
<p>A health care provider licensed under Title 18 RCW is guilty of false representation in assisted reproduction if he or she knowingly provides false information to a patient related to gametes used or provided for assisted reproduction or the donor of the gametes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The appropriate board or commission under Title 18 RCW or department may investigate any allegations of false representation under this section, and may conduct an enforcement action against the licensed provider pursuant to this chapter.</p>
</li>

<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/18_businesses_and_professions/18.130_regulation_of_health_professions%E2%80%94uniform_disciplinary_act.html">18.130.180</a>.

<ol>
<li>
<p>The commission of any act involving moral turpitude, dishonesty, or corruption relating to the practice of the person's profession, whether the act constitutes a crime or not. If the act constitutes a crime, conviction in a criminal proceeding is not a condition precedent to disciplinary action. Upon such a conviction, however, the judgment and sentence is conclusive evidence at the ensuing disciplinary hearing of the guilt of the license holder of the crime described in the indictment or information, and of the person's violation of the statute on which it is based. For the purposes of this section, conviction includes all instances in which a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is the basis for the conviction and all proceedings in which the sentence has been deferred or suspended. Nothing in this section abrogates rights guaranteed under chapter 9.96A RCW;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Suspension, revocation, or restriction of the individual's license to practice any health care profession by competent authority in any state, federal, or foreign jurisdiction, a certified copy of the order, stipulation, or agreement being conclusive evidence of the revocation, suspension, or restriction;</p>

<p>Conviction of any gross misdemeanor or felony relating to the practice of the person's profession.
