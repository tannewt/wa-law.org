<h2 id="section-1-996">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-996">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Strong consumer protection and antitrust penalties are critical to protecting consumers and ensuring a fair marketplace;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strong penalties ensure accountability, deter violations, and ensure a level playing field for businesses;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington currently does not provide strong penalties for violations of the state's consumer protection act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices and unfair methods of competition;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington's penalty for unfair or deceptive acts or practices has not kept pace with inflation, and has not increased since 1970;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington's penalty for unfair methods of competition has also not kept pace with inflation, and has not increased since 1983;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consequently, Washington has one of the lowest consumer protection penalties in the United States;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Twenty-four state legislatures representing more than 200 million Americans have passed enhanced penalties for violations that target or impact certain vulnerable populations, but Washington does not have an enhanced penalty;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many Washingtonians are hurting financially due to the impacts of the global pandemic;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington's weak penalties place Washington consumers at greater risk; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washingtonians deserve strong consumer protections to ensure entities that illegally, unfairly, and deceptively go after their hard-earned dollars are held accountable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
