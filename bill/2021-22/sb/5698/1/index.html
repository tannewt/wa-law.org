<p>a. The original dollar amount of the retirement allowance as of June 30, 2022, or the effective date of retirement, whichever is later;</p>
<p>b. The index for the calendar year prior to July 1, 2021, or the effective date of the retirement allowance, whichever is later, to be known as &quot;index A&quot;;</p>
