Whenever the legislative authority of a county, or the municipal authorities of a city, or the state officers authorized to lay out and construct state roads, or the state parks and recreation commission, desire to extend a highway across a railroad at grade, they shall file a written petition with the commission, setting forth the reasons why the crossing cannot be made either above or below grade. Upon receiving the petition, the commission shall immediately investigate it, giving at least ten days' notice to the railroad company and the county or city affected thereby, of the time and place of the investigation, to the end that all parties interested may be present and heard. If the highway involved is a state road or parkway, the secretary of transportation or the state parks and recreation commission shall be notified of the time and place of hearing. The evidence introduced shall be reduced to writing and be filed by the commission. If it finds that it is not practicable to cross the railroad or highway either above or below grade, the commission shall enter a written order in the cause, either granting or denying the right to construct a grade crossing at the point in question. The commission may provide in the order authorizing a grade crossing, or at any subsequent time, that the railroad company shall install and maintain proper signals, warnings, flaggers, interlocking devices, or other devices or means to secure the safety of the public and its employees. In respect to existing railroad grade crossings over highways the construction of which grade crossings was accomplished other than under a commission order authorizing it, the commission may in any event require the railroad company to install and maintain, at or near each crossing, on both sides of it, a sign known as the sawbuck crossing sign with the lettering &quot;Railroad Crossing&quot; inscribed thereon with a suitable inscription indicating the number of tracks. The sign shall be of standard design conforming to specifications furnished by the Washington state department of transportation.</p>

<p>If the commission finds that it is impracticable to construct an over-crossing or under-crossing on the established or proposed highway, and shall find that by deflecting the established or proposed highway a practicable and feasible over-crossing or under-crossing or a safer grade crossing can be provided, it shall continue the hearing and hold a supplemental hearing thereon. At least ten days' notice of the time and place of the supplemental hearing shall be given to all landowners that may be affected by the proposed change in location of the highways. At the supplemental hearing the commission shall inquire into the propriety and necessity of changing and deflecting the highway as proposed. If the proposed change in route of the highway involves the abandonment and vacation of a portion of an established highway, the owners of land contiguous to the portion of the highway to be vacated shall, in like manner, be notified of the time and place of the supplemental hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing, the commission shall enter its findings in writing, and shall determine the location of the crossing which may be constructed, and whether it shall be an under-crossing, over-crossing or grade crossing, and shall determine whether or not any proposed change in the route of an existing highway, or the abandonment of a portion thereof is advisable or necessary to secure an over-crossing, under-crossing, or safer grade crossing.</p>

<p>The mayor and city council, or other governing body of any city or town, or the legislative authority of any county within which there exists any under-crossing, over-crossing, or grade crossing, or where any street or highway is proposed to be located or established across any railroad, or any railroad company whose road is crossed by any highway, may file with the commission their or its petition in writing, alleging that the public safety requires the establishment of an under-crossing or over-crossing, or an alteration in the method and manner of an existing crossing and its approaches, or in the style and nature of construction of an existing over-crossing, under-crossing, or grade crossing, or a change in the location of an existing highway or crossing, the closing or discontinuance of an existing highway crossing, and the diversion of travel thereon to another highway or crossing, or if not practicable, to change the crossing from grade or to close and discontinue the crossing, the opening of an additional crossing for the partial diversion of travel, and praying that this relief may be ordered. If the existing or proposed crossing is on a state road, highway, or parkway, the petition may be filed by the secretary of transportation or the state parks and recreation commission. If the existing crossing is adjacent to a project funded in part or in full by the state of Washington and managed by the department of transportation, and closure of the crossing is part of the project, the petition may be filed by the secretary of transportation or the secretary's designee, or if the petition is filed by another entity, the secretary of transportation or the secretary's designee shall intervene as a party in any hearing at which the closure of the crossing is contested. If the department of transportation is not a lead agency under chapter 43.21C RCW, a lead agency shall also intervene as a party in any hearing at which the closure of the crossing is contested. Upon the petition being filed, the commission shall fix a time and place for hearing the petition and shall give not less than twenty days' notice to the petitioner, the railroad company, and the municipality or county in which the crossing is situated. If the highway involved is a state highway or parkway, or if the crossing is adjacent to a project funded in part or in full by the state of Washington and managed by the department of transportation and closure of the crossing is part of the project, like notice shall be given to the secretary of transportation or the state parks and recreation commission. If the change petitioned for requires that private lands, property, or property rights be taken, damaged, or injuriously affected to open up a new route for the highway, or requires that any portion of any existing highway be vacated and abandoned, twenty days' notice of the hearing shall be given to the owner or owners of the private lands, property, and property rights which it is necessary to take, damage, or injuriously affect, and to the owner or owners of the private lands, property, or property rights that will be affected by the proposed vacation and abandonment of the existing highway. The commission shall also cause notice of the hearing to be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the community where the crossing is situated, which publication shall appear at least two days before the date of hearing. At the time and place fixed in the notice, all persons and parties interested are entitled to be heard and introduce evidence. In the case of a petition for closure of a grade crossing the commission may order the grade crossing closed without hearing where: (1) Notice of the filing of the petition is posted at, or as near as practical to, the crossing; (2) notice of the filing of the petition is published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the community or area where the crossing is situated, which publication shall appear within the same week that the notice referred to in subsection (1) of this section is posted; and (3) no objections are received by the commission within twenty days from the date of the publication of the notice.</p>

<p>Whenever the secretary of transportation or the governing body of any city, town, or county, or any railroad company whose road is crossed by any highway, shall deem that the public safety requires signals or other warning devices, other than sawbuck signs, at any crossing of a railroad at common grade by any state, city, town, or county highway, road, street, alley, avenue, boulevard, parkway, or other public place actually open and in use or to be opened and used for travel by the public, he or she or it shall file with the utilities and transportation commission a petition in writing, alleging that the public safety requires the installation of specified signals or other warning devices at such crossing or specified changes in the method and manner of existing crossing warning devices. Upon receiving such petition, the commission shall promptly set the matter for hearing, giving at least twenty days notice to the railroad company or companies and the county or municipality affected thereby, or the secretary of transportation in the case of a state highway, of the time and place of such hearing. At the time and place fixed in the notice, all persons and parties interested shall be entitled to be heard and introduce evidence, which shall be reduced to writing and filed by the commission.

If the commission shall determine from the evidence that public safety requires the installation of such signals or other warning devices at such crossing or such change in the existing warning devices at said crossing, it shall make determinations to that effect and enter an order directing the installation of such signals or other warning devices or directing that such changes shall be made in existing warning devices. The commission shall also at said hearing apportion the entire cost of installation and maintenance of such signals or other warning devices, other than sawbuck signs, as provided in RCW 81.53.271: PROVIDED, That upon agreement by all parties to waive hearing, the commission shall forthwith enter its order.</p>

<p>The petition shall set forth by description the location of the crossing or crossings, the type of signal or other warning device to be installed, the necessity from the standpoint of public safety for such installation, the approximate cost of installation and related work, and the approximate annual cost of maintenance. If the commission directs the installation of a grade crossing protective device, and a federal-aid funding program is available to participate in the costs of such installation, installation and maintenance costs of the device shall be apportioned in accordance with the provisions of RCW 81.53.295. Otherwise if installation is directed by the commission, it shall apportion the cost of installation and maintenance as provided in this section:</p>

If the proposed installation is located at a new crossing requested by a railroad, then the entire cost shall be apportioned to the railroad. In the event the city, town, county, or state should concurrently petition the commission and secure an order authorizing the closure of an existing crossing or crossings in proximity to the crossing for which installation of signals or other warning devices shall have been directed, the apportionment to the petitioning city, town, county, or state shall be reduced by ten percent of the total cost for each crossing ordered closed and the apportionment from the grade crossing protective fund increased accordingly. This exception shall not be construed to permit a charge to the grade crossing protective fund in an amount greater than the total cost otherwise apportionable to the city, town, county, or state. No reduction shall be applied where one crossing is closed and another opened in lieu thereof, nor to crossings of a private nature.</p>

During the 2013-2015 fiscal biennium, funds in this account may also be used to conduct the study required under section 102, chapter 222, Laws of 2014. The commission shall transfer from the public service revolving fund's miscellaneous fees and penalties accounts moneys appropriated for these purposes as needed. At the time the commission makes each allocation of cost to said grade crossing protective fund, it shall certify that such cost shall be payable out of said fund. When federal-aid highway funds are involved, the department of transportation shall, upon entry of an order by the commission requiring the installation or upgrading of a grade crossing protective device, submit to the commission an estimate for the cost of the proposed installation and related work. Upon receipt of the estimate the commission shall pay to the department of transportation the percentage of the estimate specified in RCW 81.53.295, as now or hereafter amended, to be used as the grade crossing protective fund portion of the cost of the installation and related work.</p>
<p>The commission may adopt rules for the allocation of money from the grade crossing protective fund. During the 2015-2017 and 2017-2019 fiscal biennia, the commission may waive rules regarding local matching fund requirements, maximum awards for individual projects, and other application requirements as necessary to expedite the allocation of money from the grade crossing protective fund to address underprotected grade crossings as identified by the commission.</p>
