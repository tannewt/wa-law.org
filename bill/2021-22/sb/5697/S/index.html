<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington's statewide waste recovery rate, which seeks to preserve public health, safety, and welfare, and conserve energy and natural resources, has been on a declining trend since 2011 and that Washington is not on track to meet the statewide goal of 50 percent waste recovery established in 1989.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that packaging designs and materials have changed and the way Washington's residents use, consume, and manage materials when no longer wanted has also changed significantly in recent years. These shifts have created unintended consequences, such as the deterioration of natural systems regionally and worldwide, as well as increased levels of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global climate change, and reductions in human well-being, especially for the most vulnerable populations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that convenient and environmentally sound extended producer responsibility programs that include collecting, transporting, reusing, and recycling, or the proper end-of-life management of unwanted products help protect Washington's environment and the health of state residents. Unwanted products should be managed in a manner where a priority is placed on prevention, waste reduction, source reduction, reuse, and recycling over energy recovery and landfill disposal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that many residents, particularly those who live in rural areas and in multifamily residences, do not have access to convenient or affordable curbside recycling, and must rely on taking recyclables to drop box locations, and that extended producer responsibility programs could make curbside recycling available and affordable for most people in the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that the department of ecology was directed, through an independent consultant, to study how plastic packaging is managed in the state, assess various policy options, and that the study recommendations included establishing an extended producer responsibility policy for all consumer packaging and paper products with a framework that makes producers responsible for achieving specific management and environmental outcomes for the packaging and paper products they supply into Washington state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, the legislature finds extended producer responsibility policies designed to cover all material types collected through the state's existing recycling system offers the potential for greater economies of scale and operational efficiencies than could be achieved under a policy applied only to a subset of materials collected through that system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that extended producer responsibility programs, including targets, are implemented by and for producers of consumer packaging and paper products in a manner that involves producers from design concept to end-of-life management, and incentivizes innovation and research to minimize environmental impacts of the packaging and paper products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also intended that these programs be responsibly managed, so that covered products are handled from the point of collection through the final destination in a way that benefits the environment and minimizes risks to public health and worker health and safety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, it is further the intent of the legislature that, through design and innovation, industry shall reduce the use of consumer packaging and paper products, increase the use of postconsumer recycled content and make all packaging reusable, recyclable, or compostable. The legislature intends that the policy of the state is to ensure that by 2040 an overall recycling and reuse rate of 90 percent is achieved for consumer packaging and paper products.</p>

<li>
<p>Continuing technological changes in methods of manufacture, packaging, and marketing of consumer products, together with the economic and population growth of this state, the rising affluence of its citizens, and its expanding industrial activity have created new and ever-mounting problems involving disposal of garbage, refuse, and solid waste materials resulting from domestic, agricultural, and industrial activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Traditional methods of disposing of solid wastes in this state are no longer adequate to meet the ever-increasing problem. Improper methods and practices of handling and disposal of solid wastes pollute our land, air and water resources, blight our countryside, adversely affect land values, and damage the overall quality of our environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Considerations of natural resource limitations, energy shortages, economics and the environment make necessary the development and implementation of solid waste recovery and/or recycling plans and programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Waste reduction must become a fundamental strategy of solid waste management. It is therefore necessary to change manufacturing and purchasing practices and waste generation behaviors to reduce the amount of waste that becomes a governmental responsibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Source separation of waste must become a fundamental strategy of solid waste management. Collection and handling strategies should have, as an ultimate goal, the source separation of all materials with resource value or environmental hazard.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of state, county, and city governments to provide for a waste management infrastructure to fully implement waste reduction and source separation strategies and to process and dispose of remaining wastes in a manner that is environmentally safe and economically sound. It is further the responsibility of state, county, and city governments to monitor the cost-effectiveness and environmental safety of combusting separated waste, processing mixed municipal solid waste, and recycling programs.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of state government to ensure that local governments are providing adequate source reduction and separation opportunities and incentives to all, including persons in both rural and urban areas, and nonresidential waste generators such as commercial, industrial, and institutional entities, recognizing the need to provide flexibility to accommodate differing population densities, distances to and availability of recycling markets, and collection and disposal costs in each community; and to provide county and city governments with adequate technical resources to accomplish this responsibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It is the responsibility of producers to help provide for the responsible management of their products.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Environmental and economic considerations in solving the state's solid waste management problems requires strong consideration by local governments of regional solutions and intergovernmental cooperation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following priorities for the collection, handling, and management of solid waste are necessary and should be followed in descending order as applicable:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Waste reduction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recycling, with source separation of recyclable materials as the preferred method;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Energy recovery, incineration, or landfill of separated waste;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Energy recovery, incineration, or landfill of mixed municipal solid wastes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the state's goal to achieve a fifty percent recycling rate by 2007.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the state's goal that programs be established to eliminate residential or commercial yard debris in landfills by 2012 in those areas where alternatives to disposal are readily available and effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Steps should be taken to make recycling at least as affordable and convenient to the ratepayer as mixed waste disposal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is necessary to compile and maintain adequate data on the types and quantities of solid waste that are being generated and to monitor how the various types of solid waste are being managed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vehicle batteries should be recycled and the disposal of vehicle batteries into landfills or incinerators should be discontinued.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excessive and nonrecyclable packaging of products should be avoided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comprehensive education should be conducted throughout the state so that people are informed of the need to reduce, source separate, and recycle solid waste.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All governmental entities in the state should set an example by implementing aggressive waste reduction and recycling programs at their workplaces and by purchasing products that are made from recycled materials and are recyclable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To ensure the safe and efficient operations of solid waste disposal facilities, it is necessary for operators and regulators of landfills and incinerators to receive training and certification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is necessary to provide adequate funding to all levels of government so that successful waste reduction and recycling programs can be implemented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The development of stable and expanding markets for recyclable materials is critical to the long-term success of the state's recycling goals. Market development must be encouraged on a state, regional, and national basis to maximize its effectiveness. The state shall assume primary responsibility for the development of a multifaceted market development program to carry out the purposes of chapter 431, Laws of 1989.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is an imperative need to anticipate, plan for, and accomplish effective storage, control, recovery, and recycling of discarded tires and other problem wastes with the subsequent conservation of resources and energy.</p>
