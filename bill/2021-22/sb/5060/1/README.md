# Senate Bill 5060

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Xml/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5060.xml)
## Section 1
In RCW 89.10.005, the legislature has found and previously recognized the importance of retaining land in agriculture to produce food, livestock, and other agricultural products as well as to maintain the state economy and environmental conditions. The legislature now finds that there have been situations in this state where agricultural land has been lost due to unforeseen circumstances that commonly befall an aging farming population. The legislature finds that there is a public interest in retaining farms and the water rights needed to continue the operation of these farms. Small farms, especially, are often owned by families whose history is vested in the land. Farming is often the result of a generational commitment to feeding the nation and the world. Farmers are stewards of the land and have learned to adapt over time. The practices they use preserve the land and provide additional benefits of wildlife habitat and open space. Modern times have made it challenging to transition these farms through generations. As such, the legislature finds that temporary reductions in use of water on agricultural property for many reasons, including a future development of the use of property with the intent to continue irrigation in the future upon completion of the development, should not result in relinquishment. Additionally, farmers should have the opportunity to maintain their use of water purchased in good faith. The transition of small to mid-size farmers to new owners and a new generation of farmers, as well as the transition to more efficient irrigation systems, should be encouraged, not discouraged. The legislature recognizes that there are times when these transitions sometimes require more than a five-year period and the legislature wants to encourage the retention of the water that is essential to the viability of agriculture.

1. **The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.**

**"Good faith purchaser" means a person who purchased real property after 2000, together with a water right permit, certificate, or claim that has been disclosed to have been put to beneficial use pursuant to RCW 64.06.020, and who did not have knowledge at the time of purchase that the water right may have been relinquished due to nonuse under RCW 90.14.130.**

2. Unless a different meaning is plainly required by the context, the following words and phrases **in this subsection** as used in **this section and** RCW **90.14.041** through 90.14.121 shall have the following meanings:

    a. "Person" shall mean an individual, partnership, association, public or private corporation, city or other municipality, county, or a state agency, and the United States of America when claiming water rights established under the laws of the state of Washington.

1. For the purposes of RCW 90.14.130 through 90.14.180, "sufficient cause" shall be defined as the nonuse of all or a portion of the water by the owner of a water right for a period of five or more consecutive years where such nonuse occurs as a result of:

    a. Drought, or other unavailability of water;

    b. Active service in the armed forces of the United States during military crisis;

    c. Nonvoluntary service in the armed forces of the United States;

    d. The operation of legal proceedings;

    e. **Illness, injury, disability, or death of the holder of the water right documented by a recording of an official medical document with the county auditor that shows that the illness, injury, disability, or death precluded or temporarily reduced the use of a water right or a portion of the water right;**

    f. Federal or state agency leases of or options to purchase lands or water rights which preclude or reduce the use of the right by the owner of the water right;

    g. Federal laws imposing land or water use restrictions either directly or through the voluntary enrollment of a landowner in a federal program implementing those laws, or acreage limitations, or production quotas;

    h. Temporarily reduced water need for irrigation use where such reduction is due to varying weather conditions, including but not limited to precipitation and temperature, that warranted the reduction in water use, so long as the water user's diversion and delivery facilities are maintained in good operating condition consistent with beneficial use of the full amount of the water right;

    i. Temporarily reduced diversions or withdrawals of irrigation water directly resulting from the provisions of a contract or similar agreement in which a supplier of electricity buys back electricity from the water right holder and the electricity is needed for the diversion or withdrawal or for the use of the water diverted or withdrawn for irrigation purposes;

    l. The reduced use of irrigation water resulting from crop rotation. For purposes of this subsection, crop rotation means the temporary change in the type of crops grown resulting from the exercise of generally recognized sound farming practices. Unused water resulting from crop rotation will not be relinquished if the remaining portion of the water continues to be beneficially used

.

2. Notwithstanding any other provisions of RCW 90.14.130 through 90.14.180, there shall be no relinquishment of any water right:

    i. If such a right is involved in an approved local water plan created under RCW 90.92.090, provided the right is subject to an agreement not to divert under RCW 90.92.050, or provided the right is banked under RCW 90.92.070**;**

    j. **If the use of such a right is contingent upon a final determination from the department of ecology on a change application filed under RCW 90.03.250, 90.03.380, or 90.44.100;**

    k. **If such a right is used for agricultural irrigation and the right or portion of the right is purchased by a good faith purchaser together with real property, and the water is either put to beneficial use within five years after the purchase or any nonuse beyond the five-year period is based on sufficient cause under subsection (1) of this section or otherwise qualifies as being exempt under this subsection. This subsection (2)(k) applies only to land being used for agricultural purposes that is located in a county that is east of the crest of the Cascade mountains in which at least forty percent of the county is public land, borders Canada, and where there are no anadromous fisheries in the stream where the diversion of water occurs or where the diversion from a groundwater withdrawal occurs; or**

    l. **If the use of such a right is the subject of any legal proceedings including, but not limited to, divorce, probate, or bankruptcy**.

3. In adding provisions to this section by chapter 237, Laws of 2001, the legislature does not intend to imply legislative approval or disapproval of any existing administrative policy regarding, or any existing administrative or judicial interpretation of, the provisions of this section not expressly added or revised.
