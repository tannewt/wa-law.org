<p>An offender is eligible for the special drug offender sentencing alternative for driving under the influence if the offender:</p>

<li>
<p>A motion for a special drug offender sentencing alternative for driving under the influence may be made by the court, the offender, or the state if the midpoint of the standard sentence range is 26 months or less. If an offender has a higher midpoint, a motion for a special drug offender sentencing alternative for driving under the influence can only be made by joint agreement of the state and offender.</p>

<p>If the sentencing court determines that the offender is eligible for an alternative sentence under this section and that the alternative sentence is appropriate, the court shall waive imposition of a sentence within the standard sentence range and:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Impose a sentence equivalent to a prison-based alternative under RCW 9.94A.662, and subject to the same requirements and restrictions as are established in that section, if the low end of the standard sentence range is greater than 24 months; or</p>

<li>
<p>If the court is considering imposing a sentence under the residential substance use disorder treatment-based alternative, the court may order an examination of the offender by the department. The examination shall, at a minimum, address the following issues:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Whether the offender suffers from a substance use disorder;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the substance use disorder is such that there is a probability that criminal behavior will occur in the future;</p>

<li>
<p>Whether effective treatment for the offender's substance use disorder is available from a provider that has been licensed or certified by the department of health; and</p>
