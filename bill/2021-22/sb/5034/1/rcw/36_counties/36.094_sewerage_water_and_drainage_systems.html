<h2 id="3694020---purposepowers-4">36.94.020 - Purpose—Powers. <a class="header-anchor" href="#3694020---purposepowers-4">¶</a></h2>
<p>The construction, operation, and maintenance of a system of sewerage and/or water is a county purpose. Subject to the provisions of this chapter, every county has the power, individually or in conjunction with another county or counties to adopt, provide for, accept, establish, condemn, purchase, construct, add to, operate, and maintain a system or systems of sanitary and storm sewers, including outfalls, interceptors, plans, and facilities and services necessary for sewerage treatment and disposal, and/or system or systems of water supply within all or a portion of the county. However, counties shall not have power to condemn sewerage and/or water systems of any municipal corporation or private utility.</p>
<p>Such county or counties shall have the authority to control, regulate, operate, and manage such system or systems and to provide funds therefor by general obligation bonds, revenue bonds, local improvement district bonds, utility local improvement district or local improvement district assessments, and in any other lawful fiscal manner. Rates or charges for on-site inspection and maintenance services may not be imposed under this chapter on the development, construction, or reconstruction of property.</p>
<p>Under this chapter, after July 1, 1998, any requirements for pumping the septic tank of an on-site sewage system should be based, among other things, on actual measurement of accumulation of sludge and scum by a trained inspector, trained owner's agent, or trained owner. Training must occur in a program approved by the state board of health or by a local health officer.</p>
<p>Before adopting on-site inspection and maintenance utility services, or incorporating residences into an on-site inspection and maintenance or sewer utility under this chapter, notification must be provided, prior to the applicable public hearing, to all residences within the proposed service area that have on-site systems permitted by the local health officer. The notice must clearly state that the residence is within the proposed service area and must provide information on estimated rates or charges that may be imposed for the service.</p>
<p>A county shall not provide on-site sewage system inspection, pumping services, or other maintenance or repair services under this section using county employees unless the on-site system is connected by a publicly owned collection system to the county's sewerage system, and the on-site system represents the first step in the sewage disposal process. Nothing in this section shall affect the authority of a state or local health officer to carry out their responsibilities under any other applicable law.</p>
<p>A county may, as part of a system of sewerage established under this chapter, provide for, finance, and operate any of the facilities and services and may exercise the powers expressly authorized for county stormwater, flood control, pollution prevention, and drainage services and activities under chapters 36.89, 86.12, 86.13, and 86.15 RCW. A county also may provide for, finance, and operate the facilities and services and may exercise any of the powers authorized for aquifer protection areas under chapter 36.36 RCW; for lake or beach management districts under chapter 36.61 RCW; for diking districts, and diking, drainage, and sewerage improvement districts under chapters 85.05, 85.08, 85.15, 85.16, and 85.18 RCW; and for shellfish protection districts under chapter 90.72 RCW. However, if a county by reference to any of those statutes assumes as part of its system of sewerage any powers granted to such areas or districts and not otherwise available to a county under this chapter, then (1) the procedures and restrictions applicable to those areas or districts apply to the county's exercise of those powers, and (2) the county may not simultaneously impose rates and charges under this chapter and under the statutes authorizing such areas or districts for substantially the same facilities and services, but must instead impose uniform rates and charges consistent with RCW 36.94.140. By agreement with such an area or district that is not part of a county's system of sewerage, a county may operate that area's or district's services or facilities, but a county may not dissolve any existing area or district except in accordance with any applicable provisions of the statute under which that area or district was created.</p>

<p>Whenever the county legislative authority deems it advisable and necessary for the public health and welfare of the inhabitants of the county to establish, purchase, acquire, and construct a system of sewerage and/or water, or make any additions and betterments thereto, or extensions thereof, the board shall adopt a sewerage and/or water general plan for a system of sewerage and/or water for all or a portion of the county as deemed necessary by the board. If the county has adopted a comprehensive plan for a physical development of the county pursuant to chapter 36.70 RCW and/or chapter 35.63 RCW, then the sewerage and/or water general plan shall be adopted as an element of that comprehensive plan pursuant to the applicable statute.</p>

<p>A county shall have the power to establish utility local improvement districts and local improvement districts within the area of a sewerage and/or water general plan and to levy special assessments under a mode of annual installments extending over a period not exceeding twenty years on all property specially benefited by any local improvement on the basis of the special benefits to pay in whole or in part the damages or costs of any improvements ordered in such county.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utility local improvement districts and local improvement districts may include territory within a city or town only with the written consent of the city or town, but if the local district is formed before such area is included within the city or town, no such consent shall be necessary. Utility local improvement districts and local improvement districts used to provide sewerage disposal systems may include territory within a water-sewer district providing sewerage disposal systems only with the written consent of such a water-sewer district, but if the local district is formed before such area is included within such a water-sewer district, no consent is necessary. Utility local improvement districts and local improvement districts used to provide water systems may include territory within a water-sewer district providing water systems only with the written consent of such a water-sewer district, but if the local district is formed before such area is included within such a water-sewer district, no consent is necessary.</p>

The duties devolving upon the city or town treasurer under such laws are imposed upon the county treasurer for the purposes of this chapter. The mode of assessment shall be in the manner to be determined by the county legislative authority by ordinance or resolution. As an alternative to equal annual assessment installments of principal provided for cities and towns, a county legislative authority may provide for the payment of such assessments in equal annual installments of principal and interest. Assessments in any local district may be made on the basis of special benefits up to but not in excess of the total cost of any sewerage and/or water improvement made with respect to that local district and the share of any general sewerage and/or water facilities allocable to that district. In utility local improvement districts, assessments shall be deposited into the revenue bond fund or general obligation bond fund established for the payment of bonds issued to pay such costs which bond payments are secured in part by the pledge of assessments, except pending the issuance and sale of such bonds, assessments may be deposited in a fund for the payment of such costs. In local improvement districts, assessments shall be deposited into a fund for the payment of such costs and local improvement bonds issued to finance the same or into the local improvement guaranty fund as provided by applicable statute.</p>

Such appeal shall be made by filing written notice of appeal with the clerk of the board of county commissioners and with the clerk of the superior court within ten days after the resolution confirming such assessment roll shall have become published, and such notice shall describe the property and set forth the objections of such appellant to such assessment. Within the ten days from the filing of such notice of appeal with the clerk of the superior court, the appellant shall file with the clerk of said court, a transcript consisting of the assessment roll and his or her objections thereto, together with the resolution confirming such assessment roll and the record of the board of county commissioners with reference to said assessment, which transcript, upon payment of the necessary fees therefor, shall be furnished by such clerk of the board of county commissioners and by him or her certified to contain full, true and correct copies of all matters and proceedings required to be included in such transcript. Such fees shall be the same as the fees payable to the county clerk for the preparation and certification of transcripts on appeal to the supreme court or the court of appeals in civil actions. At the time of the filing of the notice of appeal with the clerk of the superior court a sufficient bond in the penal sum of two hundred dollars, with sureties thereon as provided by law for appeals in civil cases, shall be filed conditioned to prosecute such appeal without delay, and if unsuccessful, to pay all costs to which the county is put by reason of such appeal. The court may order the appellant upon application therefor, to execute and file such additional bond or bonds as the necessity of the case may require. Within three days after such transcript is filed in the superior court, as aforesaid, the appellant shall give written notice to the clerk of the board of county commissioners that such transcript is filed. Said notice shall state a time, not less than three days from the service thereof, when the appellant will call up the said cause for hearing. The superior court shall, at said time or at such further time as may be fixed by order of the court, hear and determine such appeal without a jury, and such cause shall have preference over all civil causes pending in said court, except proceedings under an act relating to eminent domain in such county and actions of forcible entry and detainer. The judgment of the court shall confirm, correct, modify or annul the assessment insofar as the same affects the property of the appellant. A certified copy of the decision of the court shall be filed with the officer who shall have the custody of the assessment roll, and he or she shall modify and correct such assessment roll in accordance with such decision. Appellate review of the judgment of the superior court may be sought as in other cases. However, review must be sought within fifteen days after the date of the entry of the judgment of such superior court. The supreme court or the court of appeals on such appeal may correct, change, modify, confirm or annul the assessment insofar as the same affects the property of the appellant. A certified copy of the order of the supreme court or the court of appeals upon such appeal shall be filed with the officer having custody of such assessment roll, who shall thereupon modify and correct such assessment roll in accordance with such decision.</p>

<p>Whenever any land against which there has been levied any special assessment by a county shall have been sold in part or subdivided, the board of county commissioners of such county shall have the power to order a segregation of the assessment.</p>
<p>Any person desiring to have such a special assessment against a tract of land segregated to apply to smaller parts thereof shall apply to the board of county commissioners which levied the assessment.

<p>In consideration of a transfer of property by a municipal corporation to a county in the manner provided in RCW 36.94.310 through 36.94.350, a county may assume and agree to pay or provide for the payment of all or part of the indebtedness of a municipal corporation including the payment and retirement of outstanding general obligation and revenue bonds issued by a municipal corporation. Until the indebtedness of a municipal corporation thus assumed by a county has been discharged, all property within the municipal corporation and the owners and occupants of that property, shall continue to be liable for taxes, special assessments, and other charges legally pledged to pay such indebtedness. The county may assume the obligation of causing the payment of such indebtedness, collecting such taxes, assessments, and charges and observing and performing the other contractual obligations of the municipal corporation. The legislative authority of the county may act in the same manner as the governing body of the municipal corporation for the purpose of certifying the amount of any property tax to be levied and collected therein, and may cause service and other charges and assessments to be collected from such property or owners or occupants thereof, enforce such collection and perform all other acts necessary to insure performance of the contractual obligations of the municipal corporation in the same manner and by the same means as if the property of the municipal corporation had not been acquired by the county.</p>
<p>When a county assumes the obligation of paying indebtedness of a municipal corporation and if property taxes or assessments have been levied and service and other charges have accrued for such purpose but have not been collected by the municipal corporation prior to such assumption, the same when collected shall belong and be paid to the county and be used by such county so far as necessary for payment of the indebtedness of the municipal corporation existing and unpaid on the date such county assumed that indebtedness. Any funds received by the county which have been collected for the purpose of paying any bonded or other indebtedness of the municipal corporation shall be used for the purpose for which they were collected and for no other purpose until such indebtedness has been paid and retired or adequate provision has been made for such payment and retirement. No transfer of property as provided in *this amendatory act shall derogate from the claims or rights of the creditors of the municipal corporation or impair the ability of the municipal corporation to respond to its debts and obligations.</p>

<p>Every county adopting a water and/or sewerage general plan is hereby authorized to create a fund for the purpose of guaranteeing, to the extent of such fund, and in the manner hereinafter provided, the payment of all of its local improvement bonds issued, subsequent to May 19, 1981, to pay for any water or sewerage local improvement within its confines. Such fund shall be designated &quot;. . . . . . County Local Improvement Guaranty Fund&quot; and shall be established by resolution of the county legislative authority. For the purpose of maintaining such fund, every county, after the establishment thereof, shall at all times set aside and pay into such a fund such proportion of the monthly gross revenues of the water and/or sewerage system of such county as the legislative authority thereof may direct by resolution. This proportion may be varied from time to time as the county legislative authority deems expedient or necessary, except that under the existence of the conditions set forth in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the proportion must be as therein specified.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Whenever any bonds of any local improvement district have been guaranteed under RCW 36.94.380 through 36.94.400 and the guaranty fund does not have a cash balance equal to five percent of all bonds originally guaranteed under this chapter (excluding issues which have been retired in full), then five percent of the gross monthly revenues derived from all water and sewer users in the territory included in that local improvement district (but not necessarily from users in other parts of the county as a whole) may be set aside and paid into the guaranty fund. Whenever, under the requirements of this subsection, the cash balance accumulates so that it is equal to five percent of all bonds guaranteed, or to the full amount of all bonds guaranteed, outstanding and unpaid (which amount might be less than five percent of the original total guaranteed), then no further moneys need be set aside and paid into the guaranty fund so long as that condition continues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever any warrants issued against the guaranty fund, as provided in this section, remain outstanding and uncalled for lack of funds for six months from the date of issuance thereof; or whenever any coupons or bonds guaranteed under this chapter have been matured for six months and have not been redeemed either in cash or by issuance and delivery of warrants upon the guaranty fund, then five percent of the gross monthly revenues (or such portion thereof as the county legislative authority determines will be sufficient to retire those warrants or redeem those coupons or bonds in the ensuing six months) derived from all water and/or sewer users in the county shall be set aside and paid into the guaranty fund. Whenever under the requirements of this subsection all such warrants, coupons, or bonds have been redeemed, no further income need be set aside and paid into the guaranty fund under the requirements of this subsection until and unless other warrants remain outstanding and unpaid for six months or other coupons or bonds default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purpose of complying with the requirements of setting aside and paying into the local improvement guaranty fund a proportion of the monthly gross revenues of the water supply and/or sewerage system of any county, that county shall bind and obligate itself to maintain and operate such system and further bind and obligate itself to establish, maintain, and collect such rates for water as will provide gross revenues sufficient to maintain and operate such systems and to make necessary provision for the local improvement guaranty fund as specified by this section, and the county shall alter its rates for water or sewer service from time to time and shall vary the same in different portions of its territory to comply with those requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever any coupon or bond guaranteed by RCW 36.94.380 through 36.94.400 matures and there is not sufficient funds in the appropriate local improvement district bond redemption fund to pay the coupon or bond, then the county treasurer shall pay the coupon or bond from the local improvement guaranty fund of the county; if there is not sufficient funds in the guaranty fund to pay the coupon or bond, then it may be paid by issuance and delivery of a warrant upon the local improvement guaranty fund.</p>

<li>
<p>Whenever the cash balance in the local improvement guaranty fund is insufficient for the required purposes, warrants drawing interest of a rate fixed by the county legislative authority may be issued by the county auditor against the fund to meet any liability accrued against it and must be issued upon demand of the holders of any maturing coupons and/or bonds guaranteed by RCW 36.94.380 through 36.94.400, or to pay for any certificates of delinquency for delinquent installments of assessments as provided in subsection (6) of this section. Guaranty fund warrants shall be a first lien in their order of issuance upon the gross revenues set aside and paid into the guaranty fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within twenty days after the date of delinquency of any annual installment of assessments levied for the purpose of paying the local improvement bonds of any county guaranteed under the provisions of this chapter, the county treasurer shall compile a statement of all installments delinquent, together with the amount of accrued interest and penalty appurtenant to each of those installments. Thereupon the county treasurer shall forthwith purchase certificates of delinquency for all such delinquent installments. Payment for all such certificates of delinquency shall be made from the local improvement guaranty fund, and if there is not sufficient moneys in the fund to pay for such certificates of delinquency, the county treasurer shall accept the local improvement guaranty fund warrants in payment therefor. All such certificates of delinquency shall be issued in the name of the local improvement guaranty fund, and all guaranty fund warrants issued in payment therefor shall be issued in the name of the appropriate local improvement district fund. Whenever any market is available and the county legislative authority so directs, the county treasurer shall sell any certificates of delinquency belonging to the local improvement guaranty fund, but any such sale may not be for less than face value thereof plus accrued interest from the date of issuance to date of sale.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Such certificates of delinquency, as above provided, shall be issued by the county treasurer, shall bear interest at the rate of eight percent per annum, shall be in each instance for the face value of the delinquent installment, plus accrued interest to date of issuance of certificate of delinquency, plus a penalty of five percent of such face value, and shall set forth the:</p>

<p>If any certificate of delinquency is not redeemed by the second occurring first day of January subsequent to its issuance, the county treasurer shall then proceed to foreclose such certificate of delinquency in the manner specified for the foreclosure of the lien of local improvement assessments, pursuant to the laws applicable to cities or towns; and if no redemption is made within the succeeding two years the treasurer shall execute and deliver a deed conveying fee simple title to the property described in the foreclosed certificate of delinquency.</p>

So much of the money of a guaranty fund as is necessary and is not required for other purposes under the terms of RCW 36.94.380 through 36.94.400 may, at the discretion of the county legislative authority, be used to purchase property at county tax foreclosure sales or from the county after foreclosure in cases where such property is subject to unpaid local improvement assessments securing bonds guaranteed under this chapter and such purchase is deemed necessary for the purpose of protecting the guaranty fund. In such cases the fund shall be subrogated to all rights of the county. After so acquiring title to real property, the county may lease or resell and convey the property in the manner that county property is authorized to be leased or resold and for such prices and on such terms as may be determined by resolution of the county legislative authority. Any provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, all proceeds resulting from such resales belong to and shall be paid into the guaranty fund.</p>

<p>Neither the holder nor the owner of any local improvement bonds guaranteed under the provisions of RCW 36.94.380 through 36.94.400 has any claim therefor against the county by which the bonds are issued, except for payment from the special assessments made for the improvement for which the local improvement bonds were issued, and except as against the local improvement guaranty fund of the county; and the county is not liable to any holder or owner of such local improvement bond for any loss to the guaranty fund occurring in the lawful operation thereof by the county. The remedy of the holder or owner of a local improvement bond, in the case of nonpayment, is confined to the enforcement of the assessment and to the guaranty fund. A copy of the foregoing part of this section shall be plainly written, printed, or engraved on each local improvement bond guaranteed by RCW 36.94.380 through 36.94.400. The establishment of a local improvement guaranty fund by any county shall not be deemed at variance from any water and/or sewerage general plan or amendment thereto heretofore adopted by such county.</p>
<p>If any local improvement guaranty fund authorized under RCW 36.94.380 through 36.94.400 at any time has a cash balance, and the obligations guaranteed thereby have all been paid off, then such balance shall be transferred to the water and/or sewer maintenance fund of the county.</p>
