<p>A receiver must be either a general receiver or a custodial receiver. A receiver must be a general receiver if the receiver is appointed to take possession and control of all or substantially all of a person's property with authority to liquidate that property and, in the case of a business over which the receiver is appointed, wind up affairs. A receiver must be a custodial receiver if the receiver is appointed to take charge of limited or specific property of a person or is not given authority to liquidate property. The court shall specify in the order appointing a receiver whether the receiver is appointed as a general receiver or as a custodial receiver.

The court by order may convert either a general receivership or a custodial receivership into the other.</p>

<li>
<p>Provisionally, after commencement of any judicial action or nonjudicial proceeding to foreclose upon any lien against or for forfeiture of any interest in real or personal property, on application of any person, when the interest in the property that is the subject of such an action or proceeding of the person seeking the receiver's appointment is determined to be probable and either:</p>

<p>nn. In such other cases as may be provided for by law, or when, in the discretion of the court, it may be necessary to secure ample justice to the parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The superior courts of this state shall appoint as receiver of property located in this state a person who has been appointed by a federal or state court located elsewhere as receiver with respect to the property specifically or with respect to the owner's property generally, upon the application of the person or of any party to that foreign proceeding, and following the appointment shall give effect to orders, judgments, and decrees of the foreign court affecting the property in this state held by the receiver, unless the court determines that to do so would be manifestly unjust or inequitable. The venue of such a proceeding may be any county in which the person resides or maintains any office, or any county in which any property over which the receiver is to be appointed is located at the time the proceeding is commenced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least seven days' notice of any application for the appointment of a receiver must be given to the owner of property to be subject thereto and to all other parties in the action, and to other parties in interest as the court may require. If any execution by a judgment creditor under Title 6 RCW or any application by a judgment creditor for the appointment of a receiver, with respect to property over which the receiver's appointment is sought, is pending in any other action at the time the application is made, then notice of the application for the receiver's appointment also must be given to the judgment creditor in the other action. The court may shorten or expand the period for notice of an application for the appointment of a receiver upon good cause shown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The order appointing a receiver in all cases must reasonably describe the property over which the receiver is to take charge, by category, individual items, or both if the receiver is to take charge of less than all of the owner's property. If the order appointing a receiver does not expressly limit the receiver's authority to designated property or categories of property of the owner, the receiver is a general receiver with the authority to take charge over all of the owner's property, wherever located.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court may condition the appointment of a receiver upon the giving of security by the person seeking the receiver's appointment, in such amount as the court may specify, for the payment of costs and damages incurred or suffered by any person should it later be determined that the appointment of the receiver was wrongfully obtained.</p>

<p>Except as provided in this chapter or otherwise by statute, any person, whether or not a resident of this state, may serve as a receiver, with the exception that a person may not be appointed as a receiver, and shall be replaced as receiver if already appointed, if it should appear to the court that the person:</p>

<p>The court, in lieu of a bond, may approve the posting of alternative security, such as a letter of credit or a deposit of funds with the clerk of the court, to be held by the clerk to secure the receiver's faithful performance of the receiver's duties in accordance with orders of the court and state law until the court authorizes the release or return of the deposited sums. No part of the property over which the receiver is appointed may be used in making the deposit; however, any interest that may accrue on a deposit ordered by the court shall be remitted to the receiver upon the receiver's discharge. A claim against the bond shall be made within one year from the date the receiver is discharged. Claims by state agencies against the bond shall have priority.</p>

<p>The power to incur or pay expenses incidental to the receiver's preservation and use of the property with respect to which the appointment applies, and otherwise in the performance of the receiver's duties, including the power to pay obligations incurred prior to the receiver's appointment if and to the extent that payment is determined by the receiver to be prudent in order to preserve the value of property in the receiver's possession and the funds used for this purpose are not subject to any lien or right of setoff in favor of a creditor who has not consented to the payment and whose interest is not otherwise adequately protected;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the appointment applies to all or substantially all of the property of an operating business or any revenue-producing property of any person, to do all things which the owner of the business or property might do in the ordinary course of the operation of the business as a going concern or use of the property including, but not limited to, the purchase and sale of goods or services in the ordinary course of such business, and the incurring and payment of expenses of the business or property in the ordinary course;</p>

<li>
<p>A general receiver may assume or reject any executory contract or unexpired lease of the person over whose property the receiver is appointed upon order of the court following notice to the other party to the contract or lease upon notice and a hearing. The court may condition assumption or rejection of any executory contract or unexpired lease on the terms and conditions the court believes are just and proper under the particular circumstances of the case. A general receiver's performance of an executory contract or unexpired lease prior to the court's authorization of its assumption or rejection shall not constitute an assumption of the contract or lease, or an agreement by the receiver to assume it, nor otherwise preclude the receiver thereafter from seeking the court's authority to reject it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any obligation or liability incurred by a general receiver on account of the receiver's assumption of an executory contract or unexpired lease shall be treated as an expense of the receivership. A general receiver's rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease shall be treated as a breach of the contract or lease occurring immediately prior to the receiver's appointment; and the receiver's right to possess or use property pursuant to any executory contract or lease shall terminate upon rejection of the contract or lease. The other party to an executory contract or unexpired lease that is rejected by a general receiver may take such steps as may be necessary under applicable law to terminate or cancel the contract or lease. The claim of a party to an executory contract or unexpired lease resulting from a general receiver's rejection of it shall be served upon the receiver in the manner provided for by RCW 7.60.210 within thirty days following the rejection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A general receiver's power under this section to assume an executory contract or unexpired lease shall not be affected by any provision in the contract or lease that would effect or permit a forfeiture, modification, or termination of it on account of either the receiver's appointment, the financial condition of the person over whose property the receiver is appointed, or an assignment for the benefit of creditors by that person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A general receiver may not assume an executory contract or unexpired lease of the person over whose property the receiver is appointed without the consent of the other party to the contract or lease if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Applicable law would excuse a party, other than the person over whose property the receiver is appointed, from accepting performance from or rendering performance to anyone other than the person even in the absence of any provisions in the contract or lease expressly restricting or prohibiting an assignment of the person's rights or the performance of the person's duties;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The contract or lease is a contract to make a loan or extend credit or financial accommodations to or for the benefit of the person over whose property the receiver is appointed, or to issue a security of the person; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The executory contract or lease expires by its own terms, or under applicable law prior to the receiver's assumption thereof.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A receiver may not assign an executory contract or unexpired lease without assuming it, absent the consent of the other parties to the contract or lease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the receiver rejects an executory contract or unexpired lease for:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The sale of real property under which the person over whose property the receiver is appointed is the seller and the purchaser is in possession of the real property;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sale of a real property timeshare interest under which the person over whose property the receiver is appointed is the seller;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The license of intellectual property rights under which the person over whose property the receiver is appointed is the licensor; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lease of real property in which the person over whose property the receiver is appointed is the lessor;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>then the purchaser, licensee, or lessee may treat the rejection as a termination of the contract, license agreement, or lease, or alternatively, the purchaser, licensee, or lessee may remain in possession in which case the purchaser, licensee, or lessee shall continue to perform all obligations arising thereunder as and when they may fall due, but may offset against any payments any damages occurring on account of the rejection after it occurs. The purchaser of real property in such a case is entitled to receive from the receiver any deed or any other instrument of conveyance which the person over whose property the receiver is appointed is obligated to deliver under the executory contract when the purchaser becomes entitled to receive it, and the deed or instrument has the same force and effect as if given by the person. A purchaser, licensee, or lessee who elects to remain in possession under the terms of this subsection has no rights against the receiver on account of any damages arising from the receiver's rejection except as expressly provided for by this subsection. A purchaser of real property who elects to treat rejection of an executory contract as a termination has a lien against the interest in that real property of the person over whose property the receiver is appointed for the recovery of any portion of the purchase price that the purchaser has paid.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p>Any contract with the state shall be deemed rejected if not assumed within sixty days of appointment of a general receiver unless the receiver and state agency agree to its assumption or as otherwise ordered by the court for good cause shown.</p>

<p>Upon the request of a creditor, the general receiver, or any party in interest objecting to the creditor's claim, or upon order of the court, an objection is subject to mediation prior to adjudication of the objection, under the rules or orders adopted or issued with respect to mediations. However, state claims are not subject to mediation absent agreement of the state.</p>

<p>Creditors with liens on property of the estate, which liens are duly perfected under applicable law, shall receive the proceeds from the disposition of their collateral.

If and to the extent that the proceeds are less than the amount of a creditor's allowed claim or a creditor's lien is avoided on any basis, the creditor is an unsecured claim under (h) of this subsection. Secured claims shall be paid from the proceeds in accordance with their respective priorities under otherwise applicable law.</p>

<li>
<p>Actual, necessary costs and expenses incurred during the administration of the estate, other than those expenses allowable under (a) of this subsection, including allowed fees and reimbursement of reasonable charges and expenses of the receiver and professional persons employed by the receiver under RCW 7.60.180.

<p>The receiver, with the court's approval after notice and a hearing, may use, sell, or lease estate property other than in the ordinary course of business. Except in the case of a leasehold estate with a remaining term of less than two years or a vendor's interest in a real estate contract, estate property consisting of real property may not be sold by a custodial receiver other than in the ordinary course of business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court may order that a general receiver's sale of estate property either (a) under subsection (1) of this section, or (b) consisting of real property which the debtor intended to sell in its ordinary course of business be effected free and clear of liens and of all rights of redemption, whether or not the sale will generate proceeds sufficient to fully satisfy all claims secured by the property, unless either:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The property is real property used principally in the production of crops, livestock, or aquaculture, or the property is a homestead under RCW 6.13.010(1), and the owner of the property has not consented to the sale following the appointment of the receiver; or</p>
<ol type="i" start="2">
<li>The owner of the property or a creditor with an interest in the property serves and files a timely opposition to the receiver's sale, and the court determines that the amount likely to be realized by the objecting person from the receiver's sale is less than the person would realize within a reasonable time in the absence of the receiver's sale.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Upon any sale free and clear of liens authorized by this section, all security interests and other liens encumbering the property conveyed transfer and attach to the proceeds of the sale, net of reasonable expenses incurred in the disposition of the property, in the same order, priority, and validity as the liens had with respect to the property immediately before the conveyance. The court may authorize the receiver at the time of sale to satisfy, in whole or in part, any allowed claim secured by the property out of the proceeds of its sale if the interest of any other creditor having a lien against the proceeds of the sale would not thereby be impaired.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>At a public sale of property under subsection (1) of this section, a creditor with an allowed claim secured by a lien against the property to be sold may bid at the sale of the property. A secured creditor who purchases the property from a receiver may offset against the purchase price its allowed secured claim against the property, provided that the secured creditor tenders cash sufficient to satisfy in full all secured claims payable out of the proceeds of sale having priority over the secured creditor's secured claim. If the lien or the claim it secures is the subject of a bona fide dispute, the court may order the holder of the claim to provide the receiver with adequate security to assure full payment of the purchase price in the event the lien, the claim, or any part thereof is determined to be invalid or unenforceable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If estate property includes an interest as a co-owner of property, the receiver shall have the rights and powers of a co-owner afforded by applicable state or federal law, including but not limited to any rights of partition.</p>

<li>
<p>The reversal or modification on appeal of an authorization to sell or lease estate property under this section does not affect the validity of a sale or lease under that authorization to an entity that purchased or leased the property in good faith, whether or not the entity knew of the pendency of the appeal, unless the authorization and sale or lease were stayed pending the appeal.</p>
