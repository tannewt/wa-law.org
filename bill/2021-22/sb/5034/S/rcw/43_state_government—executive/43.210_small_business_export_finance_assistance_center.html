<p>The legislature finds:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The exporting of goods and services from Washington to international markets is an important economic stimulus to the growth, development, and stability of the state's businesses in both urban and rural areas, and that these economic activities create needed jobs for Washingtonians.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impediments to the entry of many small and medium-sized businesses into export markets have restricted growth in exports from the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Particularly significant impediments for many small and medium-sized businesses are the lack of easily accessible information about export opportunities and financing alternatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a need for a small business export finance assistance center which will specialize in providing export assistance to small and medium-sized businesses throughout the state in acquiring information about export opportunities and financial alternatives for exporting.</p>
</li>
