<li>
<p>Persons examined pursuant to RCW 10.77.140 may make application to the secretary for conditional release. The secretary shall, after considering the reports of experts or professional persons conducting the examination pursuant to RCW 10.77.140, forward to the court of the county which ordered the person's commitment the person's application for conditional release as well as the secretary's recommendations concerning the application and any proposed terms and conditions upon which the secretary reasonably believes the person can be conditionally released. Conditional release may also contemplate partial release for work, training, or educational purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In instances in which persons examined pursuant to RCW 10.77.140 have not made application to the secretary for conditional release, but the secretary, after considering the reports of experts or professional persons conducting the examination pursuant to RCW 10.77.140, reasonably believes the person may be conditionally released, the secretary may submit a recommendation for release to the court of the county that ordered the person's commitment. The secretary's recommendation must include any proposed terms and conditions upon which the secretary reasonably believes the person may be conditionally released. Conditional release may also include partial release for work, training, or educational purposes. Notice of the secretary's recommendation under this subsection must be provided to the person for whom the secretary has made the recommendation for release and to his or her attorney.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The court of the county which ordered the person's commitment, upon receipt of an application or recommendation for conditional release with the secretary's recommendation for conditional release terms and conditions, shall within thirty days schedule a hearing. The court may schedule a hearing on applications recommended for disapproval by the secretary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The prosecuting attorney shall represent the state at such hearings and shall have the right to have the <strong>person</strong> examined by an expert or professional person of the prosecuting attorney's choice. If the committed person is indigent, and he or she so requests, the court shall appoint a qualified expert or professional person to examine the person on his or her behalf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The issue to be determined at such a hearing is whether or not the person may be released conditionally <strong>to less restrictive alternative treatment under the supervision of a multidisciplinary transition team under conditions imposed by the court, including access to services under section 4 of this act</strong> without substantial danger to other persons, or substantial likelihood of committing criminal acts jeopardizing public safety or security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In cases that come before the court under subsection (1) or (2) of this section, the court may deny conditional release to a less restrictive alternative</strong> only on the basis of substantial evidence. The court may modify the suggested terms and conditions on which the person is to be conditionally released. Pursuant to the determination of the court after hearing, the committed person shall thereupon be released on such conditions as the court determines to be necessary, or shall be remitted to the custody of the secretary.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the order of conditional release <strong>provides for the conditional release of the person to a less restrictive alternative, including residential treatment or treatment in the community, the conditional release order must also include:</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p><strong>A</strong> requirement for the committed person to <strong>be supervised by a multidisciplinary transition team, including a specially trained</strong> community corrections officer, <strong>a representative of the department of social and health services, and a representative of the community behavioral health agency providing treatment to the person under section 4 of this act.</strong></p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p><strong>The court may omit appointment of the representative of the community behavioral health agency if the conditional release order does not require participation in behavioral health treatment;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The court may omit the appointment of a community corrections officer if it makes a special finding that the appointment of a community corrections officer would not facilitate the success of the person, or the safety of the person and the community;</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A requirement for the person to comply with conditions of supervision established by the court which shall include at a minimum</strong> reporting as directed to a <strong>designated member of the transition team</strong>, remaining within prescribed geographical boundaries, and notifying the <strong>transition team</strong> prior to making any change in the <strong>person's</strong> address or employment. If the  person is not in compliance with the court-ordered conditions of release**, the community corrections officer or another designated transition team member shall notify the secretary or the secretary's designee; and**</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court <strong>requires participation in behavioral health treatment, the name of the licensed or certified behavioral health agency responsible for identifying the services the person will receive under section 4 of this act, and a requirement that the person cooperate with the services planned by the licensed or certified behavioral health agency. The licensed or certified behavioral health agency must comply with the reporting requirements of RCW 10.77.160, and must immediately report to the court, prosecutor, and defense counsel any substantial withdrawal or disengagement from</strong> medication or treatment**,** or <strong>any</strong> change in <strong>the person's</strong> mental health condition that renders <strong>him or her</strong> a potential risk to the public .</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The role of the transition team appointed under subsection (4) of this section shall be to facilitate the success of the person on the conditional release order by monitoring the person's progress in treatment, compliance with court-ordered conditions, and to problem solve around extra support the person may need or circumstances that may arise that threaten the safety of the person or the community. The transition team may develop a monitoring plan that may be carried out by any member of the team. The transition team shall meet according to a schedule developed by the team, and shall communicate as needed if issues arise that require the immediate attention of the team.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The department of corrections shall collaborate with the department to develop specialized training for community corrections officers under this section. The lack of a trained community corrections officer must not be the cause of delay to entry of a conditional release order. Another community corrections officer may be appointed if no specially trained officer is available.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any person, whose application for conditional release has been denied, may reapply after a period of six months from the date of denial**, or sooner with the support of the department.**</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A person examined under RCW 10.77.140 or the department may make a motion for limited conditional release under this section, on the grounds that there is insufficient evidence that the person may be released conditionally to less restrictive alternative treatment under subsection (3)(c) of this section, but the person would benefit from the opportunity to exercise increased privileges while remaining under the custody and supervision of the department and with the supervision of the department these increased privileges can be exercised without substantial danger to other persons or substantial likelihood of committing criminal acts jeopardizing public safety or security. The department may respond to a person's application for conditional release by instead supporting limited conditional release</strong>.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Whenever a defendant has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, or there is reason to doubt his or her competency, the court on its own motion or on the motion of any party shall either appoint or request the secretary to designate a qualified expert or professional person, who shall be approved by the prosecuting attorney, to evaluate and report upon the mental condition of the defendant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The signed order of the court shall serve as authority for the evaluator to be given access to all records held by any mental health, medical, educational, or correctional facility that relate to the present or past mental, emotional, or physical condition of the defendant. If the court is advised by any party that the defendant may have a developmental disability, the evaluation must be performed by a developmental disabilities professional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The evaluator shall assess the defendant in a jail, detention facility, in the community, or in court to determine whether a period of inpatient commitment will be necessary to complete an accurate evaluation. If inpatient commitment is needed, the signed order of the court shall serve as authority for the evaluator to request the jail or detention facility to transport the defendant to a hospital or secure mental health facility for a period of commitment not to exceed fifteen days from the time of admission to the facility. Otherwise, the evaluator shall complete the evaluation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court may commit the defendant for evaluation to a hospital or secure mental health facility without an assessment if: (i) The defendant is charged with murder in the first or second degree; (ii) the court finds that it is more likely than not that an evaluation in the jail will be inadequate to complete an accurate evaluation; or (iii) the court finds that an evaluation outside the jail setting is necessary for the health, safety, or welfare of the defendant. The court shall not order an initial inpatient evaluation for any purpose other than a competency evaluation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The order shall indicate whether, in the event the defendant is committed to a hospital or secure mental health facility for evaluation, all parties agree to waive the presence of the defendant or to the defendant's remote participation at a subsequent competency hearing or presentation of an agreed order if the recommendation of the evaluator is for continuation of the stay of criminal proceedings, or if the opinion of the evaluator is that the defendant remains incompetent and there is no remaining restoration period, and the hearing is held prior to the expiration of the authorized commitment period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a defendant is ordered to be <strong>evaluated</strong> under this subsection (1), <strong>or when a party or the court determines at first appearance that an order for evaluation under this subsection will be requested or ordered if charges are pursued,</strong> the court may delay granting bail until the defendant has been evaluated for competency or sanity and appears before the court. Following the evaluation, in determining bail the court shall consider: (i) Recommendations of the evaluator regarding the defendant's competency, sanity, or diminished capacity; (ii) whether the defendant has a recent history of one or more violent acts; (iii) whether the defendant has previously been acquitted by reason of insanity or found incompetent; (iv) whether it is reasonably likely the defendant will fail to appear for a future court hearing; and (v) whether the defendant is a threat to public safety.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court may direct that a qualified expert or professional person retained by or appointed for the defendant be permitted to witness the evaluation authorized by subsection (1) of this section, and that the defendant shall have access to all information obtained by the court appointed experts or professional persons. The defendant's expert or professional person shall have the right to file his or her own report following the guidelines of subsection (3) of this section. If the defendant is indigent, the court shall upon the request of the defendant assist him or her in obtaining an expert or professional person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The report of the evaluation shall include the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A description of the nature of the evaluation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A diagnosis or description of the current mental status of the defendant;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the defendant suffers from a mental disease or defect, or has a developmental disability, an opinion as to competency;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the defendant has indicated his or her intention to rely on the defense of insanity pursuant to RCW 10.77.030, and an evaluation and report by an expert or professional person has been provided concluding that the defendant was criminally insane at the time of the alleged offense, an opinion as to the defendant's sanity at the time of the act, and an opinion as to whether the defendant presents a substantial danger to other persons, or presents a substantial likelihood of committing criminal acts jeopardizing public safety or security, unless kept under further control by the court or other persons or institutions, provided that no opinion shall be rendered under this subsection (3)(d) unless the evaluator or court determines that the defendant is competent to stand trial;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When directed by the court, if an evaluation and report by an expert or professional person has been provided concluding that the defendant lacked the capacity at the time of the offense to form the mental state necessary to commit the charged offense, an opinion as to the capacity of the defendant to have a particular state of mind which is an element of the offense charged;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An opinion as to whether the defendant should be evaluated by a designated crisis responder under chapter 71.05 RCW.</p>
