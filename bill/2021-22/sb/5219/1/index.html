<ol>
<li>
<p>Sustainable and resilient markets for recycled materials are essential to any successful recycling system. For many years, Washington has depended on foreign markets to accept the recyclable materials that are collected for recycling in the state. Developing domestic markets for recycled materials benefits the environment and the state's economy and is critical due to the loss of foreign markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>China's 2018 national sword policy bans the importation of recycled mixed paper and certain types of recycled plastic and imposes a stringent contamination limit on all other recycled material imports. Washington's recycling facilities are struggling to find markets for recyclable materials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plastic packaging can be recycled and can contain recycled content in order to close the loop in the recycling stream. Many companies have already taken the initiative at closing the loop by using plastic bottles that contain 100 percent recycled content. Since November 2010, one national juice company has been using bottles made with 100 percent postconsumer recycled content for all of its juices and juice smoothies. In January 2018, an international beverage producer announced that it will make all its bottles from 100 percent recycled plastic by 2025.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The requirements imposed by this chapter are reasonable and are achievable at minimal cost relative to the burden imposed by the continued excessive use of virgin materials in plastic packaging in Washington.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature encourages plastic packaging producers to use plastic packaging that exceeds the standards set forth in this chapter.</p>
