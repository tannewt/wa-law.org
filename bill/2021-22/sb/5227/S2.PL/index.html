<h2 id="section-1-257">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-257">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that a postsecondary credential such as a degree, apprenticeship, or certificate is increasingly necessary to obtain a job that offers a good salary and advancement opportunities and that increasing the number of students in Washington who obtain such a credential is essential to the state's economic success. The legislature also recognizes that equity gaps remain among postsecondary students and that those gaps particularly impact students from historically marginalized communities.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that developing and maintaining a culture of belonging and support for students, faculty, and staff at institutions of higher education is essential to student success, and that faculty and staff play a key role. The legislature therefore seeks to ensure that public institutions of higher education provide faculty and staff, as well as students, with training to give them tools to address matters related to antiracism, diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds it necessary to regularly analyze the impact of that training on the campus community and to identify any measures needed to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion. Accordingly, the legislature intends that each public institution of higher education assess the learning, working, and living environment on campus that students, faculty, and staff experience to better understand the evolving state of diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>

<p>Provide professional development, either existing or new, focused on diversity, equity, inclusion, and antiracism for faculty and staff. This program must be developed in partnership with the institution's administration, faculty, staff, and student leadership groups. Efforts must be made to ensure the program is developed and delivered by individuals with innate and acquired experience and expertise in the field of diversity, equity, and inclusion.

<p>The purpose of each professional development program curriculum must be rooted in eliminating structural racism against all races and promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion while improving academic, social, and health and wellness outcomes for students from historically marginalized communities.

Each institution must develop a goal of at least 80 percent of their total faculty and staff completing the professional development program every two years and report on their goal's progress in the report established in section 5 of this act. Each institution may determine how to show progress towards their goal.
