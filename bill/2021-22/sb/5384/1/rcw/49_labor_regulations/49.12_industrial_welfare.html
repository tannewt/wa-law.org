<p>The department may issue a notice of infraction if the department reasonably believes that an employer has failed to comply with RCW 49.12.270 or 49.12.275. The form of the notice of infraction shall be adopted by rule pursuant to chapter 34.05 RCW. An employer who is found to have committed an infraction under RCW 49.12.270 or 49.12.275 may be assessed a monetary penalty not to exceed two hundred dollars for each violation. An employer who repeatedly violates RCW 49.12.270 or 49.12.275 may be assessed a monetary penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars for each violation. For purposes of this section, the failure to comply with RCW 49.12.275 as to an employee or the failure to comply with RCW 49.12.270 as to a period of leave sought by an employee shall each constitute separate violations. An employer has twenty days to appeal the notice of infraction. Any appeal of a violation determined to be an infraction shall be heard and determined by an administrative law judge.

<p>The legislature finds that employers often distinguish between biological parents, and adoptive parents and stepparents in their employee leave policies. Many employers who grant leave to their employees to care for a newborn child either have no policy or establish a more restrictive policy regarding whether an adoptive parent or stepparent can take similar leave. The legislature further finds that many employers establish different leave policies for men and women regarding the care of a newborn or newly placed child. The legislature recognizes that the bonding that occurs between a parent and child is important to the nurturing of that child, regardless of whether the parent is the child's biological parent and regardless of the gender of the parent. For these reasons, the legislature declares that it is the public policy of this state to require that employers who grant leave to their employees to care for a newborn child make the same leave available upon the same terms for adoptive parents and stepparents, men and women.</p>
