1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and in addition to all powers and authorities, express or implied, that a credit union has under the laws of this state, a credit union has the powers and authorities that a federal credit union had on December 31, 1993, or a subsequent date **by the effective date of this section**.

2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and in addition to the powers and authorities, express or implied, that a credit union has under subsection (1) of this section, a credit union has the powers and authorities that a federal credit union has subsequent to **the effective date of this section**, if the director finds that the exercise of the power and authority serves the convenience and advantage of members of credit unions, and maintains the fairness of competition and parity between credit unions and federal credit unions. However, a credit union must comply with RCW 31.12.408.

3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and in addition to the powers and authorities, express or implied, that a credit union has under subsections (1) and (2) of this section, a credit union may exercise the powers and authorities that it would have if it were an out-of-state credit union. Any such power or authority is subject to regulation by the director. In exercising such power or authority, a credit union:

    a. Must comply with RCW 31.12.408;

    b. Is not granted the field of membership powers or authorities of any out-of-state credit union; and

    c. Must be able to exercise such power or authority consistent with the purposes of this chapter.

This notice must be sent to the director by United States mail or by electronic means if the director accepts electronic delivery. If the director takes no action on the request within thirty days of delivery of the notice, the right to exercise the power or authority is deemed granted, subject to the restrictions in subsection (3)(a) and (b) of this section.

5. The restrictions, limitations, and requirements applicable to specific powers or authorities of federal or out-of-state credit unions apply to credit unions exercising those powers or authorities permitted under this section but only insofar as the restrictions, limitations, and requirements relate to the specific exercise of the powers or authorities granted credit unions solely under this section.

6. As used in this section, "powers and authorities" include, but are not limited to, powers and authorities in corporate governance matters.

This limit does not apply to investments in, and loans to, an organization:

    i. That is wholly owned by one or more credit unions or federal or out-of-state credit unions; and

        ii. Whose activities are limited exclusively to those authorized by this chapter for a credit union;

        i. Loans to credit unions, out-of-state credit unions, or federal credit unions. However, the aggregate of loans issued under this subsection (1)(i) is limited to twenty-five percent of the total shares and deposits of the credit union making the loans;

2. **To aid in achieving its business or operational objectives, a credit union may invest in equity interests in corporations or other limited liability entities, whether or not the principal business of such other corporation or entity is related to the credit union's business. An "equity interest" is an interest such as stock in a corporation or membership in a limited liability company or a limited partnership interest in which the credit union's liability is limited to the amount of its investment and the credit union does not take on general liability.**

    a. **The entity in which the credit union invests must be engaged in or planning or developing activity that is incidental to or complementary to the credit union's operations. Activity is incidental or complementary to the credit union's operations if it would be performed for or provided to the credit union, or if it would be performed for or provided to the credit union's members in relationship to products, services, or activities that the credit union performs for or provides to its members. Such activity may not pose a risk to the safety and soundness of the credit union or the credit union industry. The entity may be engaged in other activity that is not incidental to or complementary to the credit union's operations.**

    b. **A credit union may not invest in:**

        i. **A federal depository institution or state depository institution as those terms are defined in the federal deposit insurance act, 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1813; or**

    c. **Until January 1, 2025, the initial aggregate amount of funds invested under this subsection (2) shall not exceed 2.5 percent of the net worth of the credit union, and when combined with the amount of funds invested in organizations described in subsection (1)(h) of this section, shall not exceed 10 percent of the assets of the credit union, whichever is less.**

    d. **Beginning January 1, 2025, the initial aggregate amount of funds invested under this subsection (2) shall not exceed five percent of the net worth of the credit union, and when combined with the amount of funds invested in organizations described in subsection (1)(h) of this section, shall not exceed 10 percent of the assets of the credit union, whichever
is less.**

    e. **A credit union may engage in an activity permitted under this section only with the prior authorization of the director and subject to such requirements, restrictions, or other conditions as the director may adopt by rule, order, directive, standard, policy, memorandum, or other written communication with regard to the activity. In approving or denying a proposed activity, the director shall consider the financial and management strength of the credit union and the relationship of the activity to the credit union's operations.**

3. If a credit union has lawfully made an investment that later becomes impermissible because of a change in circumstances or law, and the director finds that this investment will have an adverse effect on the safety and soundness of the credit union, then the director may require that the credit union develop a reasonable plan for the divestiture of the investment.
