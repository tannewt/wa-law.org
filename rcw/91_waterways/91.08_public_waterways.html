Each petitioner shall add a description of the lands he or she owns. If petitioners are unmarried persons they shall so state. If lands are owned by married persons, husband and wife shall join in the petition. If a petitioner is a corporation, the signature shall be accompanied by a certified copy of a resolution of the board of directors or trustees of the corporation authorizing the person signing the petition for the corporation to execute it.

With the petition there shall also be presented satisfactory evidence from the real property records of the county that the petitioners are severally the owners in fee simple of their respective tracts of land, and that all taxes and assessments due thereon are paid. If it is proposed that any lands in the district shall be filled with the material dug or dredged from such waterway, the petition shall so state, and the map of the district and plan of the improvement shall show the location, depth, and yardage of such fill. The petition may also fix the price per cubic yard at which such fill shall be charged to the land filled, which charge shall be added to the assessment for the improvement to be made upon such lands and be paid as a part thereof. If the price of filling is not fixed by the petition it may be fixed by the board.</p>
