<p>The legislature recognizes that the state as a whole benefits from investment in public infrastructure because it promotes community and economic development. Public investment stimulates business activity and helps create jobs; stimulates the redevelopment of brownfields and blighted areas in the inner city; lowers the cost of housing; and promotes efficient land use. The legislature finds that these activities generate revenue for the state and that it is in the public interest to invest in these projects through a credit against the state sales and use tax and an allocation of property tax revenue to those sponsoring local governments that can demonstrate the expected returns to the state.</p>

<p>Commencing in the second calendar year following board approval of a revenue development area, the county treasurer shall distribute receipts from regular taxes imposed on real property located in the revenue development area as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Each participating taxing district and the sponsoring local government shall receive that portion of its regular property taxes produced by the rate of tax levied by or for the taxing district on the property tax allocation revenue base value for that local infrastructure financing project in the taxing district; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sponsoring local government shall receive an additional portion of the regular property taxes levied by it and by or for each participating taxing district upon the property tax allocation revenue value within the revenue development area. However, if there is no property tax allocation revenue value, the sponsoring local government shall not receive any additional regular property taxes under this subsection (1)(b). The sponsoring local government may agree to receive less than the full amount of the additional portion of regular property taxes under this subsection (1)(b) as long as bond debt service, reserve, and other bond covenant requirements are satisfied, in which case the balance of these tax receipts shall be allocated to the participating taxing districts that levied regular property taxes, or have regular property taxes levied for them, in the revenue development area for collection that year in proportion to their regular tax levy rates for collection that year. The sponsoring local government may request that the treasurer transfer this additional portion of the property taxes to its designated agent. The portion of the tax receipts distributed to the sponsoring local government or its agent under this subsection (1)(b) may only be expended to finance public improvement costs associated with the public improvements financed in whole or in part by local infrastructure financing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county assessor shall determine the property tax allocation revenue value and property tax allocation revenue base value. This section does not authorize revaluations of real property by the assessor for property taxation that are not made in accordance with the assessor's revaluation plan under chapter 84.41 RCW or under other authorized revaluation procedures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The distribution of local property tax allocation revenue to the sponsoring local government must cease when local property tax allocation revenues are no longer obligated to pay the costs of the public improvements. Any excess local property tax allocation revenues and earnings on such revenues remaining at the time the distribution of local property tax allocation revenue terminates must be returned to the county treasurer and distributed to the participating taxing districts that imposed regular property taxes, or had regular property taxes imposed for it, in the revenue development area for collection that year, in proportion to the rates of their regular property tax levies for collection that year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The allocation to the revenue development area of that portion of the sponsoring local government's and each participating taxing district's regular property taxes levied by or for each taxing district upon the property tax allocation revenue value within that revenue development area is declared to be a public purpose of and benefit to the sponsoring local government and each participating taxing district.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The distribution of local property tax allocation revenues pursuant to this section shall not affect or be deemed to affect the rate of taxes levied by or within any sponsoring local government and participating taxing district or the consistency of any such levies with the uniformity requirement of Article VII, section 1 of the state Constitution.</p>

<p>A sponsoring local government may issue revenue bonds to fund revenue-generating public improvements, or portions of public improvements, that are located within a revenue development area.

The legislative authority of the sponsoring local government may obligate the sponsoring local government to set aside and pay into the special fund or funds a fixed proportion or a fixed amount of the revenues from the public improvements that are funded by the revenue bonds. This amount or proportion is a lien and charge against these revenues, subject only to operating and maintenance expenses. The sponsoring local government shall have due regard for the cost of operation and maintenance of the public improvements that are funded by the revenue bonds, and shall not set aside into the special fund or funds a greater amount or proportion of the revenues that in its judgment will be available over and above the cost of maintenance and operation and the amount or proportion, if any, of the revenue previously pledged.
