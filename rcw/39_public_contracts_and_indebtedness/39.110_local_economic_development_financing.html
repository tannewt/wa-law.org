<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the issuance of taxable nonrecourse revenue bonds by the Washington economic development finance authority has provided a number of Washington firms with the financing necessary to grow and create jobs. The legislature further finds that municipal authority to issue taxable nonrecourse revenue bonds does not exist and that authorizing the local issuance of taxable bonds for economic development purposes will increase local capacity to strengthen businesses and create jobs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the purpose of this chapter to grant new authority for cities, counties, and port districts that created public corporations under chapter 39.84 RCW prior to 2012, in order to build on the expertise with tax-exempt nonrecourse revenue bond financing developed by these municipalities. Therefore, these municipalities are permitted to create local economic development finance authorities to act as a financial conduit that, without using state or local government funds or lending the credit of the state or local governments, can issue taxable and nontaxable nonrecourse revenue bonds, and participate in federal, state, and local economic development programs to help facilitate access to needed capital by Washington businesses. It is also a primary purpose of this chapter to encourage the development of local innovative approaches to the problem of unmet capital needs. This chapter must be construed liberally to carry out its purposes and objectives.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A municipality that formed a public corporation under chapter 39.84 RCW prior to January 1, 2012, may, if that public corporation is still in existence, enact an ordinance creating an economic development finance authority for the purposes authorized in this chapter. The ordinance creating the authority must approve a charter for the authority containing such provisions as are authorized by and not in conflict with this chapter. Any charter issued under this chapter must contain in substance the limitations set forth in RCW 39.110.030. In any suit, action, or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of or relating to any contract of the authority, the authority is conclusively presumed to be established and authorized to transact business and exercise its powers under this chapter upon proof of the adoption of the ordinance creating the authority by the governing body. A copy of the ordinance duly certified by the clerk of the governing body of the municipality is admissible in evidence in any suit, action, or proceeding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An authority created by a municipality pursuant to this chapter may be dissolved by the municipality if: (a) The authority has no property to administer, other than funds or property, if any, to be paid or transferred to the municipality by which it was established; and (b) all the authority's outstanding obligations have been satisfied. Such a dissolution must be accomplished by the governing body of the municipality adopting an ordinance providing for the dissolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The creating municipality may, at its discretion and at any time, alter or change the structure, organizational programs, or activities of an authority, including termination of the authority if contracts entered into by the authority are not impaired. Any net earnings of an authority, beyond those necessary for retirement of indebtedness incurred by it, do not inure to the benefit of any person other than the creating municipality. Upon dissolution of an authority, title to all property owned by the authority vests in the municipality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ordinance creating an authority must include provisions establishing a board of directors to govern the affairs of the authority, what constitutes a quorum of the board of directors, and how the authority must conduct its affairs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a period of ten years after any financing through an authority, it is illegal for a director, officer, agent, or employee of an authority to have, directly or indirectly, any financial interest in any property to be included in or any contract for property, services, or materials to be furnished or used in connection with any economic development activity financed through the authority. Violation of any provision of this section is a gross misdemeanor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The finances of any authority are subject to examination by the state auditor's office pursuant to RCW 43.09.260.</p>

<li>
<p>No municipality may give or lend any money or property in aid of an authority. The municipality that creates an authority must annually review any financial statements of the authority and at all times must have access to the books and records of the authority. No authority may issue revenue obligations under this chapter except upon the approval of both the municipality under the auspices of which it was created and the county, city, or town within whose planning jurisdiction the economic development activity to be financed lies. Upon receiving approval from these jurisdictions, an authority must, before bonds may be issued, obtain one of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A letter of credit supporting the creditworthiness of the borrower from a bank with an investment grade credit rating;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confirmation that the borrower has arranged for private placement of the bonds with an institutional investor; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confirmation that the borrower has an investment grade credit rating of their own.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An authority established under the terms of this chapter constitutes an authority and an instrumentality (within the meaning of those terms in the regulations of the United States treasury and the rulings of the internal revenue service prescribed pursuant to 26 U.S.C. Sec. 103 of the federal internal revenue code of 1986, as amended) may act on behalf of the municipality under whose auspices it is created for the specific public purposes authorized by this chapter. The authority is not a municipal corporation within the meaning of the state Constitution and the laws of the state, or a political subdivision within the meaning of the state Constitution and the laws of the state, including without limitation, Article VIII, section 7 of the Washington state Constitution. A municipality may not delegate to an authority any of the municipality's attributes of sovereignty including, without limitation, the power to tax, the power of eminent domain, and the police power.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>An authority may issue its nonrecourse revenue bonds in order to obtain the funds to carry out the programs authorized in this chapter. The bonds must be special obligations of the authority, payable solely out of the special fund or funds established by the authority for their repayment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any bonds issued under this chapter may be secured by a financing document between the authority and the purchasers or owners of such bonds or between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The financing document may pledge or assign, in whole or in part, the revenues and funds held or to be received by the authority, any present or future contract or other rights to receive the same, and the proceeds thereof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The financing document may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights, security, and remedies of bond owners as may be reasonable and proper including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, provisions defining defaults and providing for remedies in the event of default which may include the acceleration of maturities, restrictions on the individual rights of action by bond owners, and covenants setting forth duties of and limitations on the authority in conduct of its programs and the management of its property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to other security provided in this chapter or otherwise by law, bonds issued by the authority may be secured, in whole or in part, by financial guaranties, by insurance or by letters of credit issued to the authority or a trustee or any other person, by any bank, trust company, insurance or surety company, or other financial institution, within or without the state. The authority may pledge or assign, in whole or in part, the revenues and funds held or to be received by the authority, any present or future contract or other rights to receive the same, and the proceeds thereof, as security for such guaranties or insurance or for the reimbursement by the authority to any issuer of such letter of credit of any payments made under such letter of credit.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without limiting the powers of the authority contained in this chapter, in connection with each issue of its obligation bonds, the authority must create and establish one or more special funds including, but not limited to, debt service and sinking funds, reserve funds, project funds, and such other special funds as the authority deems necessary, useful, or convenient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any security interest created against the unexpended bond proceeds and against the special funds created by the authority is immediately valid and binding against the money and any securities in which the money may be invested without authority or trustee possession. The security interest must be prior to any party having any competing claim against the moneys or securities, without filing or recording under Article 9A of the uniform commercial code, Title 62A RCW, and regardless of whether the party has notice of the security interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bonds may be issued as serial bonds, term bonds, or any other type of bond instrument consistent with the provisions of this chapter. The bonds must bear such date or dates; mature at such time or times; bear interest at such rate or rates, either fixed or variable; be payable at such time or times; be in such denominations; be in such form; bear such privileges of transferability, exchangeability, and interchangeability; be subject to such terms of redemption; and be sold at public or private sale, in such manner, at such time or times, and at such price or prices as the authority determines. The bonds must be executed by the manual or facsimile signatures of the authority's chair and either its secretary or executive director, and may be authenticated by the trustee (if the authority determines to use a trustee) or any registrar which may be designated for the bonds by the authority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bonds may be issued by the authority to refund other outstanding authority bonds, at or prior to maturity of, and to pay any redemption premium on, the outstanding bonds. Bonds issued for refunding purposes may be combined with bonds issued for the financing or refinancing of new projects. Pending the application of the proceeds of the refunding bonds to the redemption of the bonds to be redeemed, the authority may enter into an agreement or agreements with a corporate trustee regarding the interim investment of the proceeds and the application of the proceeds and the earnings on the proceeds to the payment of the principal of and interest on, and the redemption of, the bonds to be redeemed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bonds of the authority may be negotiable instruments under Title 62A RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neither the board of directors of the authority, nor its employees or agents, nor any person executing the bonds is personally liable on the bonds or subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance of the bonds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority may purchase its bonds with any of its funds available for the purchase. The authority may hold, pledge, cancel, or resell the bonds subject to and in accordance with agreements with bond owners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state finance committee must be notified in advance of the issuance of bonds by the authority in order to promote the orderly offering of obligations in the financial markets.</p>

<p>Bonds issued by an authority established under this chapter are not considered to constitute a debt of the state, of the municipality, or of any other municipal corporation, quasi-municipal corporation, subdivision, or agency of this state or to pledge any or all of the faith and credit of any of these entities. The revenue bonds are payable solely from both the revenues derived as a result of the economic development activities funded by the revenue bonds including, without limitation, amounts received under the terms of any financing document or by reason of any additional security furnished by beneficiaries of the economic development activity in connection with the financing thereof, and money and other property received from private sources. The issuance of bonds under this chapter do not obligate, directly, indirectly, or contingently, the state or any political subdivision of the state to levy any taxes or appropriate or expend any funds for the payment of the principal or the interest on the bonds. Each revenue bond must contain on its face, and any disclosure document prepared in conjunction with the offer and sale of bonds must include, statements to the effect that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Neither the state, the municipality, or any other municipal corporation, quasi-municipal corporation, subdivision, or agency of the state is obligated to pay the principal or the interest thereon;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No tax funds or governmental revenue may be used to pay the principal or interest thereon; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neither any or all of the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the state, the municipality, or any other municipal corporation, quasi-municipal corporation, subdivision, or agency thereof is pledged to the payment of the principal of or the interest on the revenue bond.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neither the proceeds of bonds issued under this chapter nor any money used or to be used to pay the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the bonds constitute public money or property. All of such money must be kept segregated and set apart from funds of the state and any political subdivision of the state and are not subject to appropriation or allotment by the state or subject to the provisions of chapter 43.88 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contracts entered into by an authority must be entered into in the name of the authority and not in the name of the state or any political subdivision of the state. The obligations of the authority under such contracts are obligations only of the authority and are not, in any way, obligations of the municipality creating the authority or the state. An authority may incur only those financial obligations which will be paid from revenues received pursuant to financing documents, from fees or charges paid by beneficiaries of the economic development activities funded by the revenue bonds, or from the proceeds of revenue bonds.</p>
