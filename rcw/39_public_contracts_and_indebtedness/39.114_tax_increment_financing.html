<ol>
<li>
<p>A local government may designate an increment area under this chapter and use the tax allocation revenues to pay public improvement costs, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The local government must adopt an ordinance designating an increment area within its boundaries and describing the public improvements proposed to be paid for, or financed with, tax allocation revenues;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The local government may not designate increment area boundaries such that the entirety of its territory falls within an increment area;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The increment area may not have an assessed valuation of more than $200,000,000 or more than 20 percent of the sponsoring jurisdiction's total assessed valuation, whichever is less, when the ordinance is passed. If a sponsoring jurisdiction creates two increment areas, the total combined assessed valuation in both of the two increment areas may not equal more than $200,000,000 or more than 20 percent of the sponsoring jurisdiction's total assessed valuation, whichever is less, when the ordinances are passed creating the increment areas;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A local government can create no more than two active increment areas at any given time and they may not physically overlap by including the same land in more than one increment area at any time;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ordinance must set a sunset date for the increment area, which may be no more than 25 years after the first year in which tax allocation revenues are collected from the increment area;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ordinance must identify the public improvements to be financed and indicate whether the local government intends to issue bonds or other obligations, payable in whole or in part, from tax allocation revenues to finance the public improvement costs, and must estimate the maximum amount of obligations contemplated;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ordinance must provide that the increment takes effect on June 1st following the adoption of the ordinance in (a) of this subsection;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sponsoring jurisdiction may not add additional public improvements to the project after adoption of the ordinance creating the increment area or change the boundaries of the increment area. The sponsoring jurisdiction may expand, alter, or add to the original public improvements when doing so is necessary to assure the originally approved improvements can be constructed or operated;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ordinance must impose a deadline by which commencement of construction of the public improvements shall begin, which deadline must be at least five years into the future and for which extensions shall be made available for good cause; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The local government must make a finding that:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The public improvements proposed to be paid or financed with tax allocation revenues are expected to encourage private development within the increment area and to increase the assessed value of real property within the increment area;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Private development that is anticipated to occur within the increment area as a result of the proposed public improvements will be permitted consistent with the permitting jurisdiction's applicable zoning and development standards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The private development would not reasonably be expected to occur solely through private investment within the reasonably foreseeable future without the proposed public improvements; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The increased assessed value within the increment area that could reasonably be expected to occur without the proposed public improvements would be less than the increase in the assessed value estimated to result from the proposed development with the proposed public improvements.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In considering whether to designate an increment area, the legislative body of the local government must prepare a project analysis that shall include, but need not be limited to, the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A statement of objectives of the local government for the designated increment area;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A statement as to the property within the increment area, if any, that the local government may intend to acquire;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The duration of the increment area;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identification of all parcels to be included in the area;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A description of the expected private development within the increment area, including a comparison of scenarios with the proposed public improvements and without the proposed public improvements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A description of the public improvements, estimated public improvement costs, and the estimated amount of bonds or other obligations expected to be issued to finance the public improvement costs and repaid with tax allocation revenues;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The assessed value of real property listed on the tax roll as certified by the county assessor under RCW 84.52.080 from within the increment area and an estimate of the increment value and tax allocation revenues expected to be generated;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An estimate of the job creation reasonably expected to result from the public improvements and the private development expected to occur in the increment area; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An assessment of any impacts and any necessary mitigation to address the impacts identified on the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Affordable and low-income housing;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The local business community;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The local school districts; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The local fire service.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The local government may charge a private developer, who agrees to participate in creating the increment area, a fee sufficient to cover the cost of the project analysis and establishing the increment area, including staff time, professionals and consultants, and other administrative costs related to establishing the increment area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section prohibits a local government from entering into an agreement under chapter 39.34 RCW with another local government for the administration or other activities related to tax increment financing authorized under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the project analysis indicates that an increment area will impact at least 20 percent of the assessed value in a fire protection district or regional fire protection service authority, or the fire service agency's annual report demonstrates an increase in the level of service directly related to the increment area, the local government must negotiate a mitigation plan with the fire protection district or regional fire protection service authority to address level of service issues in the increment area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The local government may reimburse the assessor and treasurer for their costs as provided in RCW 39.114.010(6)(e).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to the adoption of an ordinance authorizing creation of an increment area, the local government must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Hold at least two public briefings for the community solely on the tax increment project that include the description of the increment area, the public improvements proposed to be financed with the tax allocation revenues, and a detailed estimate of tax revenues for the participating local governments and taxing districts, including the amounts allocated to the increment public improvements. The briefings must be announced at least two weeks prior to the date being held, including publishing in a legal newspaper of general circulation and posting information on the local government website and all local government social media sites; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submit the project analysis to the office of the treasurer for review and consider any comments that the treasurer may provide upon completion of their review of the project analysis as provided under this subsection. The treasurer must complete the review within 90 days of receipt of the project analysis and may consult with other agencies and outside experts as necessary. Upon completing their review, the treasurer must promptly provide to the local government any comments regarding suggested revisions or enhancements to the project analysis that the treasurer deems appropriate based on the requirements in subsection (2) of this section.</p>

The local government may request that the treasurer transfer this additional portion of the property taxes to its designated agent.

Any excess tax allocation revenues and earnings on the tax allocation revenues remaining at the time the apportionment of tax receipts terminates must be returned to the county treasurer and distributed to the taxing districts that imposed regular property taxes, or had regular property taxes imposed for it, in the increment area for collection that year, in proportion to the rates of their regular property tax levies for collection that year.</p>

<li>
<p>A local government may issue revenue bonds to fund revenue-generating public improvements, or portions of public improvements, that are located within an increment area and that it is authorized to provide or operate. Whenever revenue bonds are to be issued, the legislative authority of the local government shall create or have created a special fund or funds from which, along with any reserves created pursuant to RCW 39.44.140, the principal and interest on these revenue bonds shall exclusively be payable. The legislative authority of the local government may obligate the local government to set aside and pay into the special fund or funds a fixed proportion or a fixed amount of the revenues from the public improvements that are funded by the revenue bonds. This amount or proportion is a lien and charge against these revenues, subject only to operating and maintenance expenses. The local government shall have due regard for the cost of operation and maintenance of the public improvements that are funded by the revenue bonds, and shall not set aside into the special fund or funds a greater amount or proportion of the revenues that in its judgment will be available over and above the cost of maintenance and operation and the amount or proportion, if any, of the revenue previously pledged. The local government may also provide that revenue bonds payable out of the same source or sources of revenue may later be issued on a parity with any revenue bonds being issued and sold.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revenue bonds issued under this section are not an indebtedness of the local government issuing the bonds, and the interest and principal on the bonds shall only be payable from the revenues lawfully pledged to meet the principal and interest requirements and any reserves created pursuant to RCW  39.44.140. The owner or bearer of a revenue bond or any interest coupon issued under this section shall not have any claim against the local government arising from the bond or coupon except for payment from the revenues lawfully pledged to meet the principal and interest requirements and any reserves created pursuant to RCW  39.44.140. The substance of the limitations included in this subsection shall be plainly printed, written, or engraved on each bond issued under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revenue bonds with a maturity in excess of 25 years shall not be issued under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislative authority of the local government shall by resolution determine for each revenue bond issue the amount, date, form, terms, conditions, denominations, maximum fixed or variable interest rate or rates, maturity or maturities, redemption rights, registration privileges, manner of execution, manner of sale, callable provisions, if any, and covenants including the refunding of existing revenue bonds. Facsimile signatures may be used on the bonds and any coupons. Refunding revenue bonds may be issued in the same manner as revenue bonds are issued.</p>
