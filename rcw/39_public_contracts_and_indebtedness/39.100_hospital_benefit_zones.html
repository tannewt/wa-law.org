<li>
<p>A local government that creates a benefit zone and has received approval from the department under RCW 82.32.700 to impose the local option sales and use tax authorized in RCW 82.14.465 may use annually any excess local excise taxes received by it from taxable activity within the benefit zone to finance public improvement costs associated with the public improvements financed in whole or in part by hospital benefit zone financing. The use of excess local excise taxes must cease when tax allocation revenues are no longer necessary or obligated to pay the costs of the public improvements. Any participating taxing authority is authorized to allocate excess local excise taxes to the local government as long as the local government has received approval from the department under RCW 82.32.700 to impose the local option sales and use tax authorized in RCW 82.14.465. The legislature declares that it is a proper purpose of a local government or participating taxing authority to allocate excess local excise taxes for purposes of financing public improvements under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A local government must provide the department accurate information describing the geographical boundaries of the benefit zone at least seventy-five days before the effective date of the ordinance creating the benefit zone. The local government must ensure that the boundary information provided to the department is kept current.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must provide the necessary information to calculate excess local excise taxes to each local government that has provided boundary information to the department as provided in this section and that has received approval from the department under RCW 82.32.700 to impose the local option sales and use tax authorized in RCW 82.14.465.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Base year&quot; means the calendar year immediately following the creation of a benefit zone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Excess local excise taxes&quot; means the amount of local excise taxes received by the local government during the measurement year from taxable activity within the benefit zone over and above the amount of local excise taxes received by the local government during the base year from taxable activity within the benefit zone. However, if a local government creates the benefit zone and reasonably determines that no activity subject to tax under chapters 82.08 and 82.12 RCW occurred in the twelve months immediately preceding the creation of the benefit zone within the boundaries of the area that became the benefit zone, &quot;excess local excise taxes&quot; means the entire amount of local excise taxes received by the local government during a calendar year period beginning with the calendar year immediately following the creation of the benefit zone and continuing with each measurement year thereafter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Local excise taxes&quot; means local revenues derived from the imposition of sales and use taxes authorized in RCW 82.14.030 at the tax rate that was in effect at the time the hospital benefit zone is approved by the department, except that if a local government reduces the rate of such tax after the hospital benefit zone was approved, &quot;local excise taxes&quot; means the local revenues derived from the imposition of the sales and use taxes authorized in RCW 82.14.030 at the lower tax rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Measurement year&quot; means a calendar year, beginning with the calendar year following the base year and each calendar year thereafter, that is used annually to measure the amount of excess state excise taxes and excess local excise taxes required to be used to finance public improvement costs associated with public improvements financed in whole or in part by hospital benefit zone financing.</p>

<li>
<p>A local government may issue revenue bonds to fund public improvements, or portions of public improvements, that are located within a benefit zone and that it is authorized to provide or operate. Whenever revenue bonds are to be issued, the legislative authority of the local government shall create or have created a special fund or funds from which, along with any reserves created pursuant to RCW 39.44.140, the principal and interest on these revenue bonds shall exclusively be payable. The legislative authority of the local government may obligate the local government to set aside and pay into the special fund or funds a fixed proportion or a fixed amount of the revenues obtained from within the benefit zone of the development, construction, operation, and maintenance of businesses supported by the public improvements that are funded by the revenue bonds. This amount or proportion is a lien and charge against these revenues, subject only to operating and maintenance expenses. The local government shall have due regard for the cost of operation and maintenance of the public improvements that are funded by the revenue bonds, and shall not set aside into the special fund or funds a greater amount or proportion of the revenues that in its judgment will be available over and above the cost of maintenance and operation and the amount or proportion, if any, of the revenue previously pledged. The local government may also provide that revenue bonds payable out of the same source or sources of revenue may later be issued on a parity with any revenue bonds being issued and sold.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revenue bonds issued pursuant to this section are not an indebtedness of the local government issuing the bonds, and the interest and principal on the bonds shall only be payable from the revenues lawfully pledged to meet the principal and interest requirements and any reserves created pursuant to RCW 39.44.140. The owner or bearer of a revenue bond or any interest coupon issued pursuant to this section shall not have any claim against the local government arising from the bond or coupon except for payment from the revenues lawfully pledged to meet the principal and interest requirements and any reserves created pursuant to RCW 39.44.140. The substance of the limitations included in this subsection shall be plainly printed, written, or engraved on each bond issued pursuant to this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revenue bonds with a maturity in excess of thirty years shall not be issued. The legislative authority of the local government shall by resolution determine for each revenue bond issue the amount, date, form, terms, conditions, denominations, maximum fixed or variable interest rate or rates, maturity or maturities, redemption rights, registration privileges, manner of execution, manner of sale, callable provisions, if any, and covenants including the refunding of existing revenue bonds. Facsimile signatures may be used on the bonds and any coupons. Refunding revenue bonds may be issued in the same manner as revenue bonds are issued.</p>
