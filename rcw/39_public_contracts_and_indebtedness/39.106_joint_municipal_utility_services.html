<p>Chapter 258, Laws of 2011 shall be known as the joint municipal utility services act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the purpose of chapter 258, Laws of 2011 to improve the ability of local government utilities to plan, finance, construct, acquire, maintain, operate, and provide facilities and utility services to the public, and to reduce costs and improve the benefits, efficiency, and quality of utility services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 258, Laws of 2011 is intended to facilitate joint municipal utility services and is not intended to expand the types of services provided by local governments or their utilities. Further, nothing in chapter 258, Laws of 2011 is intended to alter the regulatory powers of cities, counties, or other local governments or state agencies that exercise such powers. Further, nothing in chapter 258, Laws of 2011 may be construed to alter the underlying authority of the units of local government that enter into agreements under chapter 258, Laws of 2011 or to diminish in any way the authority of local governments to enter into agreements under chapter 39.34 RCW or other applicable law.</p>

<li>
<p>Subject to subsection (3) of this section, RCW 39.106.050, and applicable law, to have and exercise any other corporate powers capable of being exercised by any of its members in providing utility services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An authority, as a municipal corporation, is subject to the public records act (chapter 42.56 RCW), the open public meetings act (chapter 42.30 RCW), and the code of ethics for municipal officers (chapter 42.23 RCW), and an authority is subject to audit by the state auditor under chapter 43.09 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the exercise of its powers in connection with performing or providing utility services, an authority is subject to the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>An authority has no power to levy taxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An authority has the power of eminent domain as necessary to perform or provide utility services, but only if all of its members, other than tribal government members, have powers of eminent domain. Further, an authority may exercise the power of eminent domain only pursuant to the provisions of Washington law, in the manner and subject to the statutory limitations applicable to one or more of its Washington local government members. If all of its members are the same type of Washington governmental entity, then the statute governing the exercise of eminent domain by that type of entity shall govern. An authority may not exercise the power of eminent domain with respect to property owned by a city, town, county, special purpose district, authority, or other unit of local government, but may acquire or use such property under mutually agreed upon terms and conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An authority may pledge its revenues in connection with its obligations, and may acquire property or property rights through and subject to the terms of a conditional sales contract, a real estate contract, or a financing contract under chapter 39.94 RCW, or other federal or state financing program. However, an authority must not in any other manner mortgage or provide security interests in its real or personal property or property rights. As a local governmental entity without taxing power, an authority may not issue general obligation bonds. However, an authority may pledge its full faith and credit to the payment of amounts due pursuant to a financing contract under chapter 39.94 RCW or other federal or state financing program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order for an authority to provide a particular utility service in a geographical area, one or more of its members must have authority, under applicable law, to provide that utility service in that geographical area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a separate municipal corporation, an authority's obligations and liabilities are its own and are not obligations or liabilities of its members except to the extent and in the manner established under the provisions of an agreement or otherwise expressly provided by contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon its dissolution, after provision is made for an authority's liabilities, remaining assets must be distributed to a successor entity, or to one or more of the members, or to another public body of this state.</p>
</li>

<p>A joint municipal utility services agreement that forms and governs an authority must include the elements described in this section, together with such other provisions an authority's members deem appropriate. However, the failure of an agreement to include each and every one of the elements described in this section shall not render the agreement invalid. An agreement must:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Identify the members, together with conditions upon which additional members that are providing utility services may join the authority, the conditions upon which members may or must withdraw, including provisions for handling of relevant assets and liabilities upon a withdrawal, and the effect of boundary adjustments of the authority and boundary adjustments between or among members;</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Describe the utility services that the authority will provide;</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Describe how votes of the members represented on the authority's board are to be weighted, and set forth any limitations on the exercise of powers of the authority's board, which may include, by way of example, requirements that certain decisions be made by a supermajority of members represented on an authority's board, based on the number of members and/or some other factor or factors, and that certain decisions be ratified by the legislative authorities of the members;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe how the agreement is to be amended;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe how the authority's rules may be adopted and amended;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specify the circumstances under which the authority may be dissolved, and how it may terminate its operations, wind up its affairs, and provide for the handling, assumption, and/or distribution of its assets and liabilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>List any legally authorized substantive or corporate powers that the authority will not exercise;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specify under which personnel laws the authority will operate, which may be the personnel laws applicable to any one of its Washington local government members;</p>

<li>
<p>Specify under which public works and procurement laws the authority will operate, which may be the public works and procurement laws applicable to any one of its Washington local government members;</p>

<li>
<p>Specify how the treasurer of the authority will be appointed, which may be an officer or employee of the authority, the treasurer or chief finance officer of any Washington local government member, or the treasurer of any Washington county in which any member of the authority is located. However, if the total number of utility customers of all of the members of an authority does not exceed two thousand five hundred, the treasurer of an authority must be either the treasurer of any member or the treasurer of a county in which any member of the authority is located;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specify under which Washington state statute or statutes surplus property of the authority will be disposed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe how the authority's budgets will be prepared and adopted;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe how any assets of members that are transferred to or managed by the authority will be accounted for;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generally describe the financial obligations of members to the authority;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe how rates and charges imposed by the authority, if any, will be determined. An agreement may specify a specific Washington state statute applicable to one or all of its members for the purpose of governing rate-setting criteria applicable to retail customers, if any;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specify the Washington state statute or statutes under which bonds, notes, and other obligations of the authority will be issued for the purpose of performing or providing utility services, which must be a bond issuance statute applicable to one or more of its members other than a tribal member. If all of its members are the same type of Washington governmental entity, then a Washington state statute or statutes governing the issuance of bonds, notes, and other obligations issued by that type of entity shall govern;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specify under which Washington state statute or statutes any liens of an authority shall be exercised, which must be statutes applicable to the type or types of utility service for which the lien shall apply. Further, if all of its members are the same type of Washington governmental entity, then the statute or statutes governing that type of entity shall govern;</p>
