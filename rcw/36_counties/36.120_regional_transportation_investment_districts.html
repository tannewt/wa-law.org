<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The capacity of many of Washington state's transportation facilities have failed to keep up with the state's growth, particularly in major urban regions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state cannot by itself fund, in a timely way, many of the major capacity and other improvements required on highways of statewide significance in the state's largest urbanized area;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing a transportation system that provides efficient mobility for persons and freight requires a shared partnership and responsibility between the state, local, and regional governments and the private sector; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Timely construction and development of significant transportation improvement projects can best be achieved through enhanced funding options for governments at the county and regional levels, using already existing tax authority to address roadway and multimodal needs and new authority for regions to address critical transportation projects of statewide significance.</p>

<p>Regional transportation investment district planning committees are advisory entities that are created, convened, and empowered as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A county with a population over one million five hundred thousand persons and any adjoining counties with a population over five hundred thousand persons may create a regional transportation investment district and shall convene a regional transportation investment district planning committee.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The boundaries of the district should include at least the contiguous areas within the regional transit authority serving the counties. The boundaries must be proposed by the planning committee and approved by the county legislative authorities by ordinance before or in conjunction with approval of a regional transportation investment plan. Boundaries must follow complete parcels of land. However, any portion of a county that is located on a peninsula shall be exempt from a regional transportation investment district in which more than one county is included if (i) the portion of the county located on the peninsula is connected to the other portion of the county by a bridge improved under chapter 47.46 RCW, and (ii) the county has a national park and a population of more than five hundred thousand persons, but less than one million five hundred thousand persons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After voters within the district boundaries have approved a plan under RCW 36.120.070, elections to add areas to the district boundaries may be called by a resolution of the board, after consultation with the regional transportation planning organization and affected transit agencies and with the concurrence of the legislative authority of the city or town if the area is incorporated or with the concurrence of the county legislative authority if the area is unincorporated. The election may include a single ballot measure providing annexation to the district, approval of the plan, and approval of revenue sources necessary to finance the plan. The electorate are the voters voting within the proposed area to be annexed. A simple majority of the persons voting on the single ballot measure is required for approval of the measure.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The members of the legislative authorities participating in planning under this chapter shall serve as the district planning committee. Members of the planning committee receive no compensation, but may be reimbursed for travel and incidental expenses as the planning committee deems appropriate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The secretary of transportation, or the appropriate regional administrator of the department, as named by the secretary, shall serve on the committee as a nonvoting member.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>A regional transportation investment district planning committee may be entitled to state funding, as appropriated by the legislature, for start-up funding to pay for salaries, expenses, overhead, supplies, and similar expenses ordinarily and necessarily incurred in selecting transportation projects and funding for those transportation projects under this chapter. Upon creation of a regional transportation investment district, the district shall within one year reimburse the state for any sums advanced for these start-up costs from the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The planning committee shall conduct its affairs and formulate a regional transportation investment plan as provided under RCW 36.120.040, except that it shall elect an executive board of seven members to discharge the duties of the planning committee and formulate a regional transportation investment plan, subject to the approval of the full committee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At its first meeting, a regional transportation investment district planning committee may elect officers and provide for the adoption of rules and other operating procedures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Governance of and decisions by a regional transportation investment district planning committee must be by a sixty-percent weighted majority vote of the total membership.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The planning committee may dissolve itself at any time by a two-thirds weighted majority vote of the total membership of the planning committee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a multicounty regional transportation investment district is not formed by December 1, 2007, through approval by the voters voting on a regional transportation investment plan, then the authority under this chapter to create a district, and to fund and construct transportation projects, shall be available to each of the eligible counties described in subsection (1) of this section on an individual and independent basis.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A regional transportation investment district planning committee shall adopt a regional transportation investment plan providing for the development, construction, and financing of transportation projects. The planning committee may consider the following factors in formulating its plan:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Land use planning criteria;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The input of cities located within a participating county; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The input of regional transportation planning organizations of which a participating county is a member. A regional transportation planning organization in which a participating county is located shall review its adopted regional transportation plan and submit, for the planning committee's consideration, its list of transportation improvement priorities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The planning committee may coordinate its activities with the department, which shall provide services, data, and personnel to assist in this planning as desired by the planning committee. In addition, the planning committee may coordinate its activities with affected cities, towns, and other local governments, including any regional transit authority existing within the participating counties' boundaries, that engage in transportation planning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The planning committee shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Conduct public meetings that are needed to assure active public participation in the development of the plan;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adopt a plan proposing the:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Creation of a regional transportation investment district, including district boundaries; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Construction of transportation projects to improve mobility within each county and within the region. Operations, maintenance, and preservation of facilities or systems may not be part of the plan, except for the limited purposes provided under RCW 36.120.020(8); and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recommend sources of revenue authorized by RCW 36.120.050 and a financing plan to fund selected transportation projects. The overall plan of the district must leverage the district's financial contributions so that the federal, state, local, and other revenue sources continue to fund major congestion relief and transportation capacity improvement projects in each county and the district. A combination of local, state, and federal revenues may be necessary to pay for transportation projects, and the planning committee shall consider all of these revenue sources in developing a plan.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The plan must use tax revenues and related debt for projects that generally benefit a participating county in proportion to the general level of tax revenues generated within that participating county. This equity principle applies to all modifications to the plan, appropriation of contingency funds not identified within the project estimate, and future phases of the plan. Per agreement with a regional transit authority serving the counties participating in a district, the equity principle identified under this subsection may include using the combined district and regional transit authority revenues generated within a participating county to determine the distribution that proportionally benefits the county. For purposes of the transportation subarea equity principle established under this subsection, a district may use the five subareas within a regional transit authority's boundaries as identified in an authority's system plan adopted in May 1996. During implementation of the plan, the board shall retain the flexibility to manage distribution of revenues, debt, and project schedules so that the district may effectively implement the plan. Nothing in this section should be interpreted to prevent the district from pledging district-wide tax revenues for payment of any contract or debt entered into under RCW 36.120.130.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before adopting the plan, the planning committee, with assistance from the department, shall work with the lead agency to develop accurate cost forecasts for transportation projects. This project costing methodology must be integrated with revenue forecasts in developing the plan and must at a minimum include estimated project costs in constant dollars as well as year of expenditure dollars, the range of project costs reflected by the level of project design, project contingencies, identification of mitigation costs, the range of revenue forecasts, and project and plan cash flow and bond analysis. The plan submitted to the voters must provide cost estimates for each project, including reasonable contingency costs. Plans submitted to the voters must provide that the maximum amount possible of the funds raised will be used to fund projects in the plan, including environmental improvements and mitigation, and that administrative costs be minimized. If actual revenue exceeds actual plan costs, the excess revenues must be used to retire any outstanding debt associated with the plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a county opts not to adopt the plan or participate in the regional transportation investment district, but two or more contiguous counties do choose to continue to participate, then the planning committee may, within ninety days, redefine the regional transportation investment plan and the ballot measure to be submitted to the people to reflect elimination of the county, and submit the redefined plan to the legislative authorities of the remaining counties for their decision as to whether to continue to adopt the redefined plan and participate. This action must be completed within sixty days after receipt of the redefined plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once adopted by the planning committee, the plan must be forwarded to the participating county legislative authorities to initiate the election process under RCW 36.120.070. The planning committee shall at the same time provide notice to each city and town within the district, the governor, the chairs of the transportation committees of the legislature, the secretary of transportation, and each legislator whose legislative district is partially or wholly within the boundaries of the district.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the ballot measure is not approved, the planning committee may redefine the selected transportation projects, financing plan, and the ballot measure. The county legislative authorities may approve the new plan and ballot measure, and may then submit the revised proposition to the voters at the next election or a special election. If no ballot measure is approved by the voters by the third vote, the planning committee is dissolved.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>A local option vehicle license fee, as specified under RCW 82.80.100, of up to one hundred dollars per vehicle registered in the district. As used in this subsection, &quot;vehicle&quot; means motor vehicle as defined in RCW 46.04.320. Certain classes of vehicles, as defined under chapter 46.04 RCW, may be exempted from this fee;</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Consistent with RCW 47.56.820, the vehicle toll must first be authorized by the legislature if the toll is imposed on a state route;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consistent with RCW 47.56.850, the vehicle toll, including any change in an existing toll rate, must first be reviewed and approved by the tolling authority designated in RCW 47.56.850 if the toll, or change in toll rate, would have a significant impact, as determined by the tolling authority, on the operation of any state facility;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The regional transportation investment plan must identify the facilities that may be tolled; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise specified by law, the department shall administer the collection of vehicle tolls on designated facilities, and the state transportation commission, or its successor, shall be the tolling authority, and shall act in accordance with RCW 47.56.850.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taxes, fees, and tolls may not be imposed or authorized without an affirmative vote of the majority of the voters within the boundaries of the district voting on a ballot proposition as set forth in RCW 36.120.070. Revenues from these taxes and fees may be used only to implement the plan as set forth in this chapter. A district may contract with the state department of revenue or other appropriate entities for administration and collection of any of the taxes or fees authorized in this section.</p>

<p>At the option of the planning committee, and with the explicit approval of the regional transit authority, the participating counties may choose to impose any remaining high capacity transportation taxes under chapter 81.104 RCW that have not otherwise been used by a regional transit authority and submit to the voters a common ballot measure that creates the district, approves the regional transportation investment plan, implements the taxes, and implements any remaining high capacity transportation taxes within the boundaries of the regional transportation investment district. Collection and expenditures of any high capacity transportation taxes implemented under this section must be determined by agreement between the participating counties or district and the regional transit authority electing to submit high capacity transportation taxes to the voters under a common ballot measure as provided in this section. If the measure fails, all such unused high capacity transportation taxes revert back to and remain with the regional transit authority. A project constructed with this funding is not considered a &quot;transportation project&quot; under RCW 36.120.020.</p>

<p>The regional transportation investment district account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. The purpose of this account is to act as an account into which may be deposited state money, if any, that may be used in conjunction with district money to fund transportation projects. Additionally, the district may deposit funds into this account for disbursement, as appropriate, on transportation projects. Nothing in this section requires any state matching money. All money deposited in the regional transportation investment district account will be used for design, right-of-way acquisition, capital acquisition, and construction, or for the payment of debt service associated with these activities, for regionally funded transportation projects developed under this chapter. Only the district may authorize expenditures from the account. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW. An appropriation is not required for expenditures from this account.</p>
