<p>From and after April 1, 1937, the width of thirty feet on each side of the center line of county roads, exclusive of such additional width as may be required for cuts and fills, is the necessary and proper right-of-way width for county roads, unless the board of county commissioners, shall, in any instance, adopt and designate a different width. This shall not be construed to require the acquisition of increased right-of-way for any county road already established and the right-of-way for which has been secured.</p>

It is unlawful to erect or maintain a sign, signboard, or billboard within a distance of one hundred feet from the point of intersection of the road and railroad grade crossing located outside the corporate limits of any city or town unless, after thirty days notice to the Washington utilities and transportation commission and the railroad operating the crossing, the county legislative authority determines that it does not obscure the sight distance of a person operating a vehicle or train approaching the grade crossing.</p>

Nothing in this section prevents the posting or maintaining thereon of highway or road signs or traffic devices giving directions or distances for the information of the public when the signs conform to the &quot;Manual for Uniform Traffic Control Devices&quot; issued by the state department of transportation. The county legislative authority shall inspect highway grade crossings and make complaint of the violation of any provisions of this section.</p>
