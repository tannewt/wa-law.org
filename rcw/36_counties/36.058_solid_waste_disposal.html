<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislative authority of a county may by ordinance provide for the establishment of a system or systems of solid waste handling for all unincorporated areas of the county or for portions thereof. A county may designate a disposal site or sites for all solid waste collected in the unincorporated areas pursuant to the provisions of a comprehensive solid waste plan adopted pursuant to chapter 70A.205 RCW. However for any solid waste collected by a private hauler operating under a certificate granted by the Washington utilities and transportation commission under the provisions of chapter 81.77 RCW and which certificate is for collection in a geographic area lying in more than one county, such designation of disposal sites shall be pursuant to an interlocal agreement between the involved counties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A county may construct, lease, purchase, acquire, add to, alter, or extend solid waste handling systems, plants, sites, or other facilities and shall have full jurisdiction and authority to manage, regulate, maintain, utilize, operate, control, and establish the rates and charges for those solid waste handling systems, plants, sites, or other facilities. A county may enter into agreements with public or private parties to: (a) Construct, purchase, acquire, lease, add to, alter, extend, maintain, manage, utilize, or operate publicly or privately owned or operated solid waste handling systems, plants, sites, or other facilities; (b) establish rates and charges for those systems, plants, sites, or other facilities; (c) designate particular publicly or privately owned or operated systems, plants, sites, or other facilities as disposal sites; (d) process, treat, or convert solid waste into other valuable or useful materials or products; and (e) sell the material or products of those systems, plants, or other facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislative authority of a county may award contracts for solid waste handling that provide that a county provide for a minimum periodic fee or other method of compensation in consideration of the operational availability of those solid waste handling systems, plants, sites, or other facilities at a specified minimum level, without regard to the ownership of the systems, plants, sites or other facilities, or the amount of solid waste actually handled during all or any part of the contract. When a minimum level of solid waste is specified in a contract entered into under this section, there shall be a specific allocation of financial responsibility in the event the amount of solid waste handled falls below the minimum level provided in the contract. Solid waste handling systems, plants, sites, or other facilities constructed, purchased, acquired, leased, added to, altered, extended, maintained, managed, utilized, or operated pursuant to this section, whether publicly or privately owned, shall be in substantial compliance with the solid waste management plan applicable to the county adopted pursuant to chapter 70A.205 RCW. Agreements relating to such solid waste handling systems, plants, sites, or other facilities may be for such term and may contain such covenants, conditions, and remedies as the legislative authority of the county may deem necessary or appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As used in this chapter, the terms &quot;solid waste&quot; and &quot;solid waste handling&quot; shall be as defined in RCW 70A.205.015.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislative authority of a county may:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>By ordinance award a contract to collect source separated recyclable materials from residences within unincorporated areas. The legislative authority has complete authority to manage, regulate, and fix the price of the source separated recyclable collection service. The contracts may provide that the county pay minimum periodic fees to a municipal entity or permit holder; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notify the commission in writing to carry out and implement the provisions of the waste reduction and recycling element of the comprehensive solid waste management plan.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>This election may be made by counties at any time after July 23, 1989. An initial election must be made no later than ninety days following approval of the local comprehensive waste management plan required by RCW 70A.205.045.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the operation of a solid waste collection system by counties or to authorize counties to affect the authority of the utilities and transportation commission under RCW 81.77.020.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the provisions of any county charter or any law to the contrary, and in addition to any other authority provided by law, the legislative authority of a county may contract with one or more vendors for one or more of the design, construction, or operation of, or other service related to, the solid waste handling systems, plants, sites, or other facilities in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section. When a contract for design services is entered into separately from other services permitted under this section, procurement shall be in accord with chapter 39.80 RCW. For the purpose of this chapter, the term &quot;legislative authority&quot; shall mean the board of county commissioners or, in the case of a home rule charter county, the official, officials, or public body designated by the charter to perform the functions authorized therein.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the legislative authority of the county decides to proceed with the consideration of qualifications or proposals for services from vendors, the county shall publish notice of its requirements and request submission of qualifications statements or proposals. The notice shall be published in the official newspaper of the county at least once a week for two weeks not less than sixty days before the final date for the submission of qualifications statements or proposals. The notice shall state in summary form (a) the general scope and nature of the design, construction, operation, or other service, (b) the name and address of a representative of the county who can provide further details, (c) the final date for the submission of qualifications statements or proposals, (d) an estimated schedule for the consideration of qualifications, the selection of vendors, and the negotiation of a contract or contracts for services, (e) the location at which a copy of any request for qualifications or request for proposals will be made available, and (f) the criteria established by the legislative authority to select a vendor or vendors, which may include but shall not be limited to the vendor's prior experience, including design, construction, or operation of other similar facilities; respondent's management capability, schedule availability and financial resources; cost of the services, nature of facility design proposed by the vendor; system reliability; performance standards required for the facilities; compatibility with existing service facilities operated by the public body or other providers of service to the public; project performance guarantees; penalty and other enforcement provisions; environmental protection measures to be used; consistency with the applicable comprehensive solid waste management plan; and allocation of project risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the legislative authority of the county decides to proceed with the consideration of qualifications or proposals, it may designate a representative to evaluate the vendors who submitted qualifications statements or proposals and conduct discussions regarding qualifications or proposals with one or more vendors. The legislative authority or representative may request submission of qualifications statements and may later request more detailed proposals from one or more vendors who have submitted qualifications statements, or the representative may request detailed proposals without having first received and evaluated qualifications statements. The representative shall evaluate the qualifications or proposals, as applicable. If two or more vendors submit qualifications or proposals that meet the criteria established by the legislative authority of the county, discussions and interviews shall be held with at least two vendors. Any revisions to a request for qualifications or request for proposals shall be made available to all vendors then under consideration by the city or town and shall be made available to any other person who has requested receipt of that information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on criteria established by the legislative authority of the county, the representative shall recommend to the legislative authority a vendor or vendors that are initially determined to be the best qualified to provide one or more of the design, construction, or operation of, or other service related to, the proposed project or services. The legislative authority may select one or more qualified vendors for one or more of the design, construction, or operation of, or other service related to, the proposed project or services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislative authority or its representative may attempt to negotiate a contract with the vendor or vendors selected for one or more of the design, construction, or operation of, or other service related to, the proposed project or services on terms that the legislative authority determines to be fair and reasonable and in the best interest of the county. If the legislative authority or its representative is unable to negotiate such a contract with any one or more of the vendors first selected on terms that it determines to be fair and reasonable and in the best interest of the county, negotiations with any one or more of the vendors shall be terminated or suspended and another qualified vendor or vendors may be selected in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section. If the legislative authority decides to continue the process of selection, negotiations shall continue with a qualified vendor or vendors in accordance with this section at the sole discretion of the legislative authority until an agreement is reached with one or more qualified vendors, or the process is terminated by the legislative authority. The process may be repeated until an agreement is reached.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to entering into a contract with a vendor, the legislative authority of the county shall make written findings, after holding a public hearing on the proposal, that it is in the public interest to enter into the contract, that the contract is financially sound, and that it is advantageous for the county to use this method for awarding contracts compared to other methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each contract shall include a project performance bond or bonds or other security by the vendor that in the judgment of the legislative authority of the county is sufficient to secure adequate performance by the vendor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provisions of chapters 39.12, 39.19, and * 39.25 RCW shall apply to a contract entered into under this section to the same extent as if the systems and plants were owned by a public body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vendor selection process permitted by this section shall be supplemental to and shall not be construed as a repeal of or limitation on any other authority granted by law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The alternative selection process provided by this section may not be used in the selection of a person or entity to construct a publicly owned facility for the storage or transfer of solid waste or solid waste handling equipment unless the facility is either (a) privately operated pursuant to a contract greater than five years, or (b) an integral part of a solid waste processing facility located on the same site. Instead, the applicable provisions of RCW 36.32.250 and chapters 39.04 and 39.30 RCW shall be followed.</p>
