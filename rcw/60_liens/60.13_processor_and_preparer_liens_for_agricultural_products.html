<p>Starting on the date a producer delivers any agricultural product to a processor or conditioner, the producer has a first priority statutory lien, referred to as a &quot;processor lien.&quot; A commercial fisher who delivers fish to a processor also has a first priority statutory &quot;processor lien&quot; starting on the date the fisher delivers fish to the processor.

The processor lien attaches to the agricultural products or fish delivered, to the processor's or conditioner's inventory, and to the processor's or conditioner's accounts receivable. However, no processor lien may attach to agricultural products or fish delivered by a producer or commercial fisher, or on the producer's or fisher's behalf, to a processor which is organized and operated on a cooperative basis and of which the producer or fisher is a member, nor may such lien attach to such processor's inventory or accounts receivable.</p>
