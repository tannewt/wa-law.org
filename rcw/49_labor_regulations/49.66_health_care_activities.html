<p>It is the public policy of the state to expedite the settlement of labor disputes arising in connection with health care activities, in order that there may be no lessening, however temporary, in the quality of the care given to patients. It is the legislative purpose by this chapter to promote collective bargaining between health care activities and their employees, to protect the right of employees of health care activities to organize and select collective bargaining units of their own choosing.</p>
<p>It is further determined that any agreements involving union security including an all-union agreement or agency agreement must safeguard the rights of nonassociation of employees, based on bona fide religious tenets or teachings of a church or religious body of which such employee is a member. Such employee must pay an amount of money equivalent to regular union dues and initiation fees and assessments, if any, to a nonreligious charity or to another charitable organization mutually agreed upon by the employee affected and the representative of the labor organization to which such employee would otherwise pay dues. The employee shall furnish written proof that this has been done. If the employee and representative of the labor organization do not reach agreement on the matter, the department shall designate such organization.</p>

<p>As used in this chapter:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&quot;Health care activity&quot; includes any hospital, nursing home, institution, agency or establishment, exclusive of those operated by the state, its municipalities, or political subdivisions, having for one of its principal purposes the preservation of health or the care of sick, aged or infirm persons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Bargaining unit&quot; includes any group of employees of a health care activity having substantially common interests with respect to working conditions. The composition of a bargaining unit may be determined by common consent between an employer and its employees, or, in the event either party shall apply to the director of labor and industries for a determination of the composition of a bargaining unit, it shall be determined by the director of labor and industries or his delegated representative. No bargaining unit shall be found appropriate if it includes guards together with other employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Employee&quot; includes any registered nurse or licensed practical nurse or service personnel performing services for wages for a health care activity. The term shall not apply to a member of a religious order assigned to a health care activity by the order as a part of his obligations to it; nor shall it apply to persons performing services in connection with healing by prayer or spiritual means alone in accordance with the tenets and practices of recognized church or religious denominations by adherents thereof; nor shall it apply to supervisors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Employer&quot; includes any person, agency, corporation, company or other organization engaged in the operation of a health care activity, whether for profitable or charitable purposes.</p>

Supervisor includes registered nurses only if administrative supervision is his or her primary duty and activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Guard&quot; means any individual employed as a guard to enforce against employees and other persons rules to protect property of the employer or to protect the safety of persons on the employer's premises.</p>

<p>An employee association shall be deemed the properly designated representative of a bargaining unit when it can show evidence that bargaining rights have been assigned to it by a majority of the employees in the bargaining unit. Should questions arise concerning the representative status of any employee organization claiming to represent a bargaining unit of employees, upon petition by such an organization, it shall be the duty of the director, acting by himself or herself or through a designee to investigate and determine the composition of the organization. Any organization found authorized by not less than thirty percent of the employees of a bargaining unit shall be eligible to apply for an election to determine its rights to represent the unit. If more than one organization shall claim to represent any unit, the director, or his or her designee, may conduct an election by secret ballot to determine which organization shall be authorized to represent the unit. In order to be certified as a bargaining representative, an employee organization must receive, in a secret ballot election, votes from a majority of the employees who vote in the election, except that nothing in this section shall prohibit the voluntary recognition of a labor organization as a bargaining representative by an employer upon a showing of reasonable proof of majority. In any election held pursuant to this section, there shall be a choice on the ballot for employees to designate that they do not wish to be represented by any bargaining representative. No representation election shall be directed in any bargaining unit or any subdivision thereof within which, in the preceding twelve-month period, a valid election has been held. Thirty percent of the employees of an employer may file a petition for a secret ballot election to ascertain whether the employee organization which has been certified or is currently recognized by their employer as their bargaining representative is no longer their bargaining representative.</p>
<p>No employee organization shall be certified as the representative of employees in a bargaining unit of guards, if such organization admits to membership, or is affiliated directly or indirectly with an organization which admits to membership, employees other than guards. The determination shall be based upon a plurality of votes cast in such election, and shall remain in effect for a period of not less than one year. In determining appropriate bargaining units, the director shall limit such units to groups consisting of registered nurses, licensed practical nurses or service personnel: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That if a majority of each such classification desires inclusion within a single bargaining unit, they may combine into a single unit.</p>

<li>
<p>Interfere with, restrain or coerce employees in any manner in the exercise of their right of self-organization: PROVIDED, That the expressing of any views, argument, or opinion, or the dissemination thereof, whether in written, printed, graphic or visual form, shall not constitute or be evidence of an unfair labor practice under any of the provisions of this chapter, if such expression contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit;</p>

<p>Cause or attempt to cause an employer to pay or deliver or agree to pay or deliver any money or other thing of value, in the nature of an exaction, for services which are not performed or not to be performed;</p>

<p>Enter into any contract or agreement, express or implied, whereby an employer or other person ceases or refrains, or agrees to cease or refrain, from handling, using, selling, transporting, or otherwise dealing in any of the products or services of any other employer or person, or to cease doing business with any other employer or person, and any such contract or agreement shall be unenforceable and void; or</p>
