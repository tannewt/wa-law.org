<p>Airborne asbestos dust and particles, such as those from sprayed asbestos slurry, asbestos-coated ventilating ducts, and certain other applications of asbestos are known to produce irreversible lung damage and bronchogenic carcinoma. One American of every four dying in urban areas of the United States has asbestos particles or dust in his or her lungs. The nature of this problem is such as to constitute a hazard to the public health and safety, and should be brought under appropriate regulation.</p>

Nothing shall prevent the department from requiring such individuals to take an examination or refresher course before certification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may deny, suspend, or revoke a certificate, as provided under RCW 49.26.140, for failure of the holder to comply with any requirement of this chapter or chapter 49.17 RCW, or any rule adopted under those chapters, or applicable health and safety standards and regulations. In addition to any penalty imposed under RCW 49.26.016, the department may suspend or revoke any certificate issued under this chapter for a period of not less than six months upon the following grounds:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The certificate was obtained through error or fraud; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The holder thereof is judged to be incompetent to carry out the work for which the certificate was issued.</p>

<p>Before any certificate may be denied, suspended, or revoked, the holder thereof shall be given written notice of the department's intention to do so, mailed using a method by which the mailing can be tracked or the delivery can be confirmed to the holder's last known address. The notice shall enumerate the allegations against such holder, and shall give him or her the opportunity to request a hearing before the department.
