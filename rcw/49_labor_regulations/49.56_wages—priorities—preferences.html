<p>In cases of executions, attachments, and writs of similar nature issued against any person, except for claims for labor done, any miners, mechanics, salespersons, servants, clerks, and laborers who have claims against the defendant for labor done, may give notice of their claims and the amount thereof, sworn to by the person making the claim to the creditor and the officer executing either of such writs at any time before the actual sale of property levied on, and unless such claim is disputed by the debtor or a creditor, such officer must pay to such person out of the proceeds of the sale, the amount each is entitled to receive for services rendered within sixty days next preceding the levy of the writ, not exceeding one hundred dollars. If any or all the claims so presented and claiming preference under this chapter, are disputed by either the debtor or a creditor, the person presenting the same must commence an action within ten days from the recovery thereof, and must prosecute his or her action with due diligence, or be forever barred from any claim of priority of payment thereof; and the officer shall retain possession of so much of the proceeds of the sale as may be necessary to satisfy such claim, until the determination of such action; and in case judgment be had for the claim or any part thereof, carrying costs, the costs taxable therein shall likewise be a preferred claim with the same rank as the original claim.</p>
