## 12.08.090 - Objections to pleadings—Amendment.

\[ [2010 c 8 § 3022](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6239-S.SL.pdf?cite=2010%20c%208%20§%203022); Code 1881 § 1764; [1873 p 345 § 63](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1873%20p%20345%20§%2063); [1854 p 232 § 51](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1854%20p%20232%20§%2051); RRS § 1786; \]

## 12.08.110 - Amendments—Continuance.
The pleadings may be amended at any time before the trial, or during the trial, or upon appeal, to supply any deficiency or omissions in the allegations or denials, necessary to support the action or defense, when by such amendment substantial justice will be promoted.

The court may also, in its discretion, require as a condition of an amendment, the payment of costs to the adverse party.

\[ Code 1881 § 1766; [1873 p 346 § 65](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1873%20p%20346%20§%2065); [1854 p 232 § 53](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/session_laws.aspx?cite=1854%20p%20232%20§%2053); RRS § 1788; \]

To entitle a defendant to any setoff he or she may have against the plaintiff, he or she must allege the same in his or her answer; and the statutes regulating setoffs in the superior court, shall in all respects be applicable to a setoff in a justice's court, if the amount claimed to be setoff, after deducting the amount found due to the plaintiff, be within the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace; judgment may, in like manner, be rendered by the justice in favor of the defendant, for the balance found due the plaintiff.
