<p>The legislature finds that persons are engaging in patterns of conduct which defraud innocent homeowners of their equity interest or other value in residential dwellings under the guise of a purchase of the owner's residence but which is in fact a device to convert the owner's equity interest or other value in the residence to an equity skimmer, who fails to make payments, diverts the equity or other value to the skimmer's benefit, and leaves the innocent homeowner with a resulting financial loss or debt.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds this activity of equity skimming to be contrary to the public policy of this state and therefore establishes the crime of equity skimming to address this form of real estate fraud and abuse.</p>

<p>Any person who wilfully engages in a pattern of equity skimming is guilty of a class B felony under RCW 9A.20.021.

<li>
<p>In addition to the criminal penalties provided in RCW 61.34.030, the legislature finds that the practices covered by this chapter are matters vitally affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying chapter 19.86 RCW. A violation of this chapter is not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business and is an unfair method of competition for the purpose of applying chapter 19.86 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a private right of action under chapter 19.86 RCW for a violation of this chapter, the court may double or triple the award of damages pursuant to RCW 19.86.090, subject to the statutory limit. If, however, the court determines that the defendant acted in bad faith, the limit for doubling or tripling the award of damages may be increased, but shall not exceed one hundred thousand dollars. Any claim for damages brought under this chapter must be commenced within four years after the date of the alleged violation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The remedies provided in this chapter are cumulative and do not restrict any remedy that is otherwise available. The provisions of this chapter are not exclusive and are in addition to any other requirements, rights, remedies, and penalties provided by law. An action under this chapter shall not affect the rights in the distressed home held by a distressed home purchaser for value under this chapter or other applicable law.</p>

<p>A distressed home purchaser shall not:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Enter into, or attempt to enter into, a distressed home conveyance with a distressed homeowner unless the distressed home purchaser verifies and can demonstrate that the distressed homeowner has a reasonable ability to pay for the subsequent conveyance of an interest back to the distressed homeowner. In the case of a lease with an option to purchase, payment ability also includes the reasonable ability to make the lease payments and purchase the property within the term of the option to purchase. An evaluation of a distressed homeowner's reasonable ability to pay includes debt to income ratios, fair market value of the distressed home, and the distressed homeowner's payment and credit history. There is a rebuttable presumption that the distressed home purchaser has not verified a distressed homeowner's reasonable ability to pay if the distressed home purchaser has not obtained documentation of assets, liabilities, and income, other than an undocumented statement, of the distressed homeowner;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fail to either:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Ensure that title to the distressed home has been reconveyed to the distressed homeowner; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make payment to the distressed homeowner so that the distressed homeowner has received consideration in an amount of at least eighty-two percent of the fair market value of the property as of the date of the eviction or voluntary relinquishment of possession of the distressed home by the distressed homeowner. For the purposes of this subsection (2)(b), the following applies:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>There is a rebuttable presumption that an appraisal by a person licensed or certified by an agency of the federal government or this state to appraise real estate constitutes the fair market value of the distressed home;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Consideration&quot; means any payment or thing of value provided to the distressed homeowner, including unpaid rent owed by the distressed homeowner before the date of eviction or voluntary relinquishment of the distressed home, reasonable costs paid to independent third parties necessary to complete the distressed home conveyance transaction, the payment of money to satisfy a debt or legal obligation of the distressed homeowner, or the reasonable cost of repairs for damage to the distressed home caused by the distressed homeowner. &quot;Consideration&quot; does not include amounts imputed as a down payment or fee to the distressed home purchaser or a person acting in participation with the distressed home purchaser;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter into repurchase or lease terms as part of the distressed home conveyance that are unfair or commercially unreasonable, or engage in any other unfair or deceptive acts or practices;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Represent, directly or indirectly, that (a) the distressed home purchaser is acting as an advisor or consultant, (b) the distressed home purchaser is acting on behalf of or in the interests of the distressed homeowner, or (c) the distressed home purchaser is assisting the distressed homeowner to save the distressed home, buy time, or use other substantially similar language;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Misrepresent the distressed home purchaser's status as to licensure or certification;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform any of the following until after the time during which the distressed homeowner may cancel the transaction has expired:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Accept from any distressed homeowner an execution of, or induce any distressed homeowner to execute, any instrument of conveyance of any interest in the distressed home;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Record with the county auditor any document, including any instrument of conveyance, signed by the distressed homeowner; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer or encumber or purport to transfer or encumber any interest in the distressed home;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fail to reconvey title to the distressed home when the terms of the distressed home conveyance contract have been fulfilled;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter into a distressed home conveyance where any party to the transaction is represented by a power of attorney;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fail to extinguish or assume all liens encumbering the distressed home immediately following the conveyance of the distressed home;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fail to close a distressed home conveyance in person before an independent third party who is authorized to conduct real estate closings within the state.</p>
