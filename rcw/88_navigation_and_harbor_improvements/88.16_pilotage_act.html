<p>Every vessel not exempt under this section that operates in the waters of the Puget Sound pilotage district or Grays Harbor pilotage district is subject to compulsory pilotage under this chapter.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A United States vessel on a voyage in which it is operating exclusively on its coastwise endorsement, its fishery endorsement (including catching and processing its own catch outside United States waters and economic zone for delivery in the United States), and/or its recreational (or pleasure) endorsement, and all United States and Canadian vessels engaged exclusively in the coasting trade on the west coast of the continental United States (including Alaska) and/or British Columbia shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter unless a pilot licensed under this chapter be actually employed, in which case the pilotage rates provided for in this chapter or established under RCW 81.116.010 through 81.116.060 shall apply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board may, upon the written petition of any interested party, and upon notice and opportunity for hearing, grant an exemption from the provisions of this chapter to any vessel that the board finds is (a) a small passenger vessel that is not more than one thousand three hundred gross tons (international), does not exceed two hundred feet in overall length, is manned by United States-licensed deck and engine officers appropriate to the size of the vessel with merchant mariner credentials issued by the United States coast guard or Canadian deck and engine officers with Canadian-issued certificates of competency appropriate to the size of the vessel, and is operated exclusively in the waters of the Puget Sound pilotage district and lower British Columbia, or (b) a yacht that is not more than one thousand three hundred gross tons (international) and does not exceed two hundred feet in overall length. Such an exemption shall not be detrimental to the public interest in regard to safe operation preventing loss of human lives, loss of property, and protecting the marine environment of the state of Washington. Such petition shall set out the general description of the vessel, the contemplated use of same, the proposed area of operation, and the name and address of the vessel's owner. The board shall annually, or at any other time when in the public interest, review any exemptions granted to this specified class of small vessels to insure that each exempted vessel remains in compliance with the original exemption. The board shall have the authority to revoke such exemption where there is not continued compliance with the requirements for exemption. The board shall maintain a file which shall include all petitions for exemption, a roster of vessels granted exemption, and the board's written decisions which shall set forth the findings for grants of exemption. Each applicant for exemption or annual renewal shall pay a fee, payable to the pilotage account. Fees for initial applications and for renewals shall be established by rule, and shall not exceed one thousand five hundred dollars. The board shall report annually to the legislature on such exemptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every vessel not exempt under subsection (1) or (2) of this section shall, while navigating the Puget Sound and Grays Harbor pilotage districts, employ a pilot licensed under the provisions of this chapter and shall be liable for and pay pilotage rates in accordance with the pilotage rates herein established or which may hereafter be established under the provisions of this chapter or under RCW 81.116.010 through 81.116.060: PROVIDED, That any vessel inbound to or outbound from Canadian ports is exempt from the provisions of this section, if said vessel actually employs a pilot licensed by the Pacific pilotage authority (the pilot licensing authority for the western district of Canada), and if it is communicating with the vessel traffic system and has appropriate navigational charts, and if said vessel uses only those waters east of the international boundary line which are west of a line which begins at the southwestern edge of Point Roberts then to Alden Point (Patos Island), then to Skipjack Island light, then to Turn Point (Stuart Island), then to Kellet Bluff (Henry Island), then to Lime Kiln (San Juan Island) then to the intersection of one hundred twenty-three degrees seven minutes west longitude and forty-eight degrees twenty-five minutes north latitude then to the international boundary. The board shall correspond with the Pacific pilotage authority from time to time to ensure the provisions of this section are enforced. If any exempted vessel does not comply with these provisions it shall be deemed to be in violation of this section and subject to the penalties provided in RCW 88.16.150 as now or hereafter amended and liable to pilotage fees as determined by the board. The board shall investigate any accident on the waters covered by this chapter involving a Canadian pilot and shall include the results in its annual report.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Holds at the time of licensure as a pilot, after successful completion of the board-required training program, a first class United States endorsement without restrictions on the United States government license for the pilotage district in which the pilot applicant desires to be licensed; however, all applicants for a pilot examination scheduled to be given before July 1, 2008, must have the United States pilotage endorsement at the time of application; and</p>

<li>
<p>The board may require that applicants and pilots have federal licenses and endorsements as it deems appropriate; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Successfully completes a board-specified training program.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the requirements of (a) of this subsection, a pilot applicant must meet such other qualifications as may be required by the board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person applying for a license under this section shall not have been convicted of an offense involving drugs or the personal consumption of alcohol in the twelve months prior to the date of application. This restriction does not apply to license renewals under this section.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>When the board determines that the demand for pilots requires entry of an applicant into the training program it shall issue a training license to that applicant, but under no circumstances may an applicant be issued a training license more than four years after taking the written entry examination. The training license authorizes the trainee to do such actions as are specified in the training program.</p>
<p>After the completion of the training program the board shall evaluate the trainee's performance and knowledge. The board, as it deems appropriate, may then issue a pilot license, delay the issuance of the pilot license, deny the issuance of the pilot license, or require further training and evaluation.</p>

<p>The board may (a) appoint a special independent committee or (b) contract with private or governmental entities knowledgeable and experienced in the development, administration, and grading of licensing examinations or simulator evaluations for marine pilots, or (c) do both. Active, licensed pilots designated by the board may participate in the development, administration, and grading of examinations and other evaluation exercises. If the board does appoint a special examination or evaluation development committee, it is authorized to pay the members of the committee the same compensation and travel expenses as received by members of the board. Any person who willfully gives advance knowledge of information contained on a pilot examination or other evaluation exercise is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This subsection applies to the review of a pilot applicant's written examinations and evaluation exercises to qualify to be placed on a waiting list to become a pilot trainee. Failure to comply with the process set forth in this subsection renders the results of the pilot applicant's written examinations and evaluation exercises final. A pilot applicant may seek board review, administrative review, and judicial review of the results of the written examinations and evaluation exercises in the following manner:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A pilot applicant who seeks a review of the results of his or her written examinations or evaluation exercises must request from the board-appointed or board-designated examination committee an administrative review of the results of his or her written examinations or evaluation exercises as set forth by board rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The determination of the examination committee's review of a pilot applicant's examination results becomes final after thirty days from the date of service of written notification of the committee's determination unless a full adjudicative hearing before an administrative law judge has been requested by the pilot applicant before the thirty-day period has expired, as set forth by board rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a full adjudicative hearing has been requested by the pilot applicant, the board shall request the appointment of an administrative law judge under chapter 34.12 RCW who has sufficient experience and familiarity with pilotage matters to be able to conduct a fair and impartial hearing. The hearing shall be governed by chapter 34.05 RCW. The administrative law judge shall issue an initial order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The initial order of the administrative law judge is final unless within thirty days of the date of service of the initial order the board or pilot applicant requests review of the initial order under chapter 34.05 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board may appoint a person to review the initial order and to prepare and enter a final order as governed by chapter 34.05 RCW and as set forth by board rule. The person appointed by the board under this subsection (6)(e) is called the board reviewing officer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pilots are licensed under this section for a term of five years from and after the date of the issuance of their respective state licenses. Licenses must thereafter be renewed as a matter of course, unless the board withholds the license for good cause. Each pilot shall pay to the state treasurer an annual license fee in an amount set by the board by rule. Pursuant to RCW 43.135.055, the fees established under this subsection may be increased through the fiscal year ending June 30, 2011. The fees must be deposited in the pilotage account. The board may assess partially active or inactive pilots a reduced fee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All pilots and pilot trainees are subject to an annual physical examination by a physician chosen by the board. The physician shall examine the pilot's or pilot trainee's heart, blood pressure, circulatory system, lungs and respiratory system, eyesight, hearing, and such other items as may be prescribed by the board. After consultation with a physician and the United States coast guard, the board shall establish minimum health standards to ensure that pilots and pilot trainees licensed by the state are able to perform their duties. Within ninety days of the date of each annual physical examination, and after review of the physician's report, the board shall make a determination of whether the pilot or pilot trainee is fully able to carry out the duties of a pilot or pilot trainee under this chapter. The board may in its discretion check with the appropriate authority for any convictions of or information regarding offenses by a licensed pilot or pilot trainee involving drugs or the personal consumption of alcohol in the prior twelve months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board may require vessel simulator training for a pilot trainee and shall require vessel simulator training for a licensed pilot subject to RCW 88.16.105. The board shall also require vessel simulator training in the first year of active duty for a new pilot and at least once every five years for all active pilots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board shall prescribe, pursuant to chapter 34.05 RCW, such reporting requirements and review procedures as may be necessary to assure the accuracy and validity of license and service claims. Willful misrepresentation of such required information by a pilot applicant shall result in disqualification of the pilot applicant.</p>

In developing these disciplinary or corrective actions, the board shall take into account the cause of the disciplinary action and the pilot's previous record.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board shall immediately review the pilot's license of a pilot who has been charged with any offense involving drugs or the personal consumption of alcohol while on duty, including an offense of operation of a vehicle or vessel while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. After a hearing held pursuant to subsection (5) of this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The board shall order a pilot who has been found to have been convicted of an offense involving drugs or the personal consumption of alcohol while on duty and who has not been convicted of another offense involving drugs or the personal consumption of alcohol in the previous five years to actively participate in and satisfactorily complete a specific program of treatment. The board may impose other sanctions it determines are appropriate. If the pilot does not satisfactorily complete the program of treatment, the board shall suspend, revoke, or withhold the pilot's license until the treatment is completed; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board shall suspend for not less than one year the license of a pilot found to have been convicted of a second or subsequent offense involving drugs or the personal consumption of alcohol while on duty.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the board determines that reasonable cause exists to issue a reprimand, impose a fine, suspend, revoke, or withhold any pilot's license or require training or treatment under subsection (1), (2), or (4) of this section, it shall prepare and personally serve upon such pilot a notice advising him or her of the board's intended action, the specific grounds for the action, and the right to request a hearing to challenge the board's action. The pilot shall have thirty days from the date on which notice is served to request a full hearing before an administrative law judge on the issue of the reprimand, fine, suspension, revocation, or withholding of his or her pilot's license, or requiring treatment or training. The board's proposed reprimand, fine, suspension, revocation, or withholding of a license, or requiring treatment or training shall become final upon the expiration of thirty days from the date notice is served, unless a hearing has been requested prior to that time. When a hearing is requested, the board shall request the appointment of an administrative law judge under chapter 34.12 RCW who has sufficient experience and familiarity with pilotage matters to be able to conduct a fair and impartial hearing. The hearing shall be governed by the provisions of Title 34 RCW. All final decisions of the administrative law judge shall be subject to review by the superior court of the state of Washington for Thurston county, by the superior court of the county in which the pilot maintains his or her residence or principal place of business, or by the superior court of the county in which the board maintains its office, to which court any case with all the papers and proceedings therein shall be immediately certified by the administrative law judge if requested to do so by any party to the proceedings at any time within thirty days after the date of any such final decision. No appeal may be taken after the expiration of thirty days after the date of final decision. Any case so certified to the superior court shall be tried de novo and after certification of the record to said superior court the proceedings shall be had as in a civil action. Moneys collected from fines under this section shall be deposited in the pilotage account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board shall have the power, on an emergency basis, to temporarily suspend a state pilot's license: (a) When a pilot has been involved in any vessel accident where there has been major property damage, loss of life, or loss of a vessel, or (b) where there is a reasonable cause to believe that a pilot has diminished mental capacity or is under the influence of drugs, alcohol, or other substances, when in the opinion of the board, such an accident or physical or mental impairment would significantly diminish that pilot's ability to carry out pilotage duties and that the public health, safety, and welfare requires such emergency action. The board shall make a determination within seventy-two hours whether to continue the suspension. The board shall develop rules for exercising this authority including procedures for the chairperson or vice chairperson of the board to temporarily order such suspensions, emergency meetings of the board to consider such suspensions, the length of suspension, opportunities for hearings, and an appeal process. The board shall develop rules under chapter 34.05 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board shall immediately notify the United States coast guard that it has revoked or suspended a license pursuant to this section and that a suspended or revoked license has been reinstated.</p>

<p>Because of the danger of spills, the legislature finds that the transportation of crude oil and refined petroleum products by tankers on the Columbia river and on Puget Sound and adjacent waters creates a great potential hazard to important natural resources of the state and to jobs and incomes dependent on these resources.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that the Columbia river has many natural obstacles to navigation and shifting navigation channels that create the risk of an oil spill. The legislature also recognizes Puget Sound and adjacent waters are a relatively confined saltwater environment with irregular shorelines and therefore there is a greater than usual likelihood of long-term damage from any large oil spill.</p>
<p>The legislature further recognizes that certain areas of the Columbia river and Puget Sound and adjacent waters have limited space for maneuvering a large oil tanker and that these waters contain many natural navigational obstacles as well as a high density of commercial and pleasure boat traffic.</p>
<p>For these reasons, it is important that large oil tankers be piloted by highly skilled persons who are familiar with local waters and that such tankers have sufficient capability for rapid maneuvering responses.</p>
<p>It is therefore the intent and purpose of RCW 88.16.180 and 88.16.190 to decrease the likelihood of oil spills on the Columbia river and on Puget Sound and its shorelines by requiring all oil tankers above a certain size to employ licensed pilots and to be escorted by a tug or tugs while navigating on certain areas of Puget Sound and adjacent waters.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>By December 31, 2025, the board of pilotage commissioners, in consultation with the department of ecology, must adopt rules regarding tug escorts to address the peculiarities of Puget Sound for the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Oil tankers of between five thousand and forty thousand deadweight tons; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both articulated tug barges and towed waterborne vessels or barges that are: (A) Designed to transport oil in bulk internal to the hull; and (B) greater than five thousand deadweight tons.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The requirements of this section do not apply to:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>A towed general cargo deck barge; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A vessel providing bunkering or refueling services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rule making pursuant to (a) of this subsection must be for operating in the waters east of the line extending from Discovery Island light south to New Dungeness light and all points in the Puget Sound area. This rule making must address the tug escort requirements applicable to Rosario Strait and connected waterways to the east established in RCW 88.16.190(2)(a)(ii), and may adjust or suspend those requirements based on expertise developed under subsection (5) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To achieve the rule adoption deadline in (a) of this subsection, the board of pilotage commissioners must adhere to the following interim milestones:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>By September 1, 2020, identify and define the zones, specified in subsection (3)(a) of this section, to inform the analysis required under subsection (5) of this section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By December 31, 2021, complete a synopsis of changing vessel traffic trends; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By September 1, 2023, consult with potentially affected federally recognized Indian treaty fishing tribes, other federally recognized treaty tribes with potentially affected interests, and stakeholders as required under subsection (6) of this section and complete the analysis required under subsection (5) of this section. By September 1, 2023, the department of ecology must submit a summary of the results of the analysis required under subsection (5) of this section to the legislature consistent with RCW 43.01.036.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>When developing rules, the board of pilotage commissioners must consider recommendations from potentially affected federally recognized Indian treaty fishing tribes, other federally recognized treaty tribes with potentially affected interests, and:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The results of the most recently completed vessel traffic risk assessments;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The report developed by the department of ecology as required under section 206, chapter 262, Laws of 2018;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The recommendations included in the southern resident orca task force report, November 2018, and any subsequent research or reports on related topics;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changing vessel traffic trends, including the synopsis required under subsection (1)(d)(ii) of this section; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For any formally proposed draft rules or adopted rules, identified estimates of expected costs and benefits of the rule to:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>State government agencies to administer and enforce the rule; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Private persons or businesses, by category of type of person or business affected.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the rules adopted under this section, the board of pilotage commissioners must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Base decisions for risk protection on geographic zones in the waters specified in subsection (1)(c) of this section. As the initial foci of the rules, the board of pilotage commissioners must equally prioritize geographic zones encompassing: (i) Rosario Strait and connected waterways to the east; and (ii) Haro Strait and Boundary Pass;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specify operational requirements, such as tethering, for tug escorts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include functionality requirements for tug escorts, such as aggregate shaft horsepower for tethered tug escorts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be designed to achieve best achievable protection, as defined in RCW 88.46.010, as informed by consideration of:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Accident records in British Columbia and Washington waters;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Existing propulsion and design standards for covered tank vessels; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The characteristics of the waterways; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Publish a document that identifies the sources of information that it relied upon in developing the rules, including any sources of peer-reviewed science and information submitted by tribes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rules adopted under this section may not require oil tankers, articulated tug barges, or towed waterborne vessels or barges to be under the escort of a tug when these vessels are in ballast or are unladen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To inform rule making, the board of pilotage commissioners must conduct an analysis of tug escorts using the model developed by the department of ecology under RCW 88.46.250. The board of pilotage commissioners may:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Develop scenarios and subsets of oil tankers, articulated tug barges, and towed waterborne vessels or barges that could preclude requirements from being imposed under the rule making for a given zone or vessel;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the benefits of vessel safety measures that are newly in effect on or after July 1, 2019, and prior to the adoption of rules under this section; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter into an interagency agreement with the department of ecology to assist with conducting the analysis and developing the rules, subject to each of the requirements of this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board of pilotage commissioners must consult with the United States coast guard, the Puget Sound harbor safety committee, potentially affected federally recognized Indian treaty fishing tribes, other federally recognized treaty tribes with potentially affected interests, ports, local governments, state agencies, and other appropriate entities before adopting tug escort rules applicable to any portion of Puget Sound. Considering relevant information elicited during the consultations required under this subsection, the board of pilotage commissioners must also design the rules with a goal of avoiding or minimizing additional underwater noise from vessels in the Salish Sea, focusing vessel traffic into established shipping lanes, protecting and minimizing vessel traffic impacts to established treaty fishing areas, and respecting and preserving the treaty-protected interests and fishing rights of potentially affected federally recognized Indian tribes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rules adopted under this section must be periodically updated consistent with RCW 88.46.260.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Articulated tug barge&quot; means a tank barge and a towing vessel joined by hinged or articulated fixed mechanical equipment affixed or connecting to the stern of the tank barge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Oil tanker&quot; means a self-propelled deep draft tank vessel designed to transport oil in bulk. &quot;Oil tanker&quot; does not include an articulated tug barge tank vessel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Towed general cargo deck barge&quot; means a waterborne vessel or barge designed to carry cargo on deck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Waterborne vessels or barges&quot; means any ship, barge, or other watercraft capable of traveling on the navigable waters of this state and capable of transporting any crude oil or petroleum product in quantities of ten thousand gallons or more for purposes other than providing fuel for its motor or engine.</p>
