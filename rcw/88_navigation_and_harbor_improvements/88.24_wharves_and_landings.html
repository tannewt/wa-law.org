And they shall annually prescribe the rates of wharfage and charges thereon, but there shall be no charge for the landing of passengers or their baggage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No such authority shall be granted to any person other than the owner of the land where the wharf is proposed to be erected, unless such owner shall neglect to apply for such authority; and whenever application shall be made for such authority by any person other than such owner, the board of county commissioners shall not grant the same unless proof shall be made that the applicant caused notice in writing of his or her intention to make such application, to be given by posting up at least three notices in public places in the neighborhood where the proposed wharf is to be erected and one notice at the county courthouse, twenty days prior to any regular session of the board of county commissioners at which application shall be made and by serving a copy of said notice in writing upon such owner of the land, if residing in the county, at least ten days before the session of the board of county commissioners at which the application is made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When such application is heard, if the owner of such land applies for such authority and files his or her undertaking with one or more sureties to be approved by the county commissioners in a sum not less than one hundred dollars nor more than five hundred dollars, to be fixed by the county commissioners, conditioned that such person will erect said wharf within the time therein limited, to be fixed by the county commissioners, and maintain the same and keep said wharf according to law; and if default shall at any time be made in the condition of such undertaking damages not exceeding the penalty may be recovered by any person aggrieved before any court having competent jurisdiction, then said county commissioners shall authorize such owner of the land to erect and keep such wharf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If such owner of the land does not apply as aforesaid the commissioners may authorize the same to be erected and kept by such applicant upon his or her entering into an undertaking as required of such owner of the land.</p>
