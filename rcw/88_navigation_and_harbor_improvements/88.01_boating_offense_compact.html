<p>Concurrent Jurisdiction</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If conduct is prohibited by two adjoining party states, courts and law enforcement officers in either state who have jurisdiction over boating offenses committed where waters form a common interstate boundary have concurrent jurisdiction to arrest, prosecute, and try offenders for the prohibited conduct committed anywhere on the boundary water between the two states.</p>
</li>
