<p>The legislature declares:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>That the history, economy, culture, and the future of Washington state's agriculture involves the beef industry.

</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>That it is in the overriding public interest that support for the beef industry be clearly expressed, that adequate protection be given to agricultural commodities, uses, activities, and operations, and that beef and beef products be promoted individually, and as part of a comprehensive industry to:</p>
