<li>
<p>Every person operating any logging railroad or industrial railway shall, prior to July 1st of each year, file with the commission a statement showing the number of, and location, by name of highway, quarter section, section, township, and range of all crossings on his or her line and pay with the filing a fee for each crossing so reported. The commission shall, by order, fix the exact fee based on the cost of rendering such inspection service. All fees collected shall be deposited in the state treasury to the credit of the public service revolving fund. Intersections having one or more tracks shall be treated as a single crossing. Tracks separated a distance in excess of one hundred feet from the nearest track or group of tracks shall constitute an additional crossing. Where two or more independently operated railroads cross each other or the same highway intersection, each independent track shall constitute a separate crossing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every person failing to make the report and pay the fees as required by this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and in addition subject to a penalty of twenty-five dollars for each day that the fee remains unpaid after it becomes due.</p>
