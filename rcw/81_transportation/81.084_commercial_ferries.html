<li>
<p>A commercial ferry may not operate any vessel or ferry for the public use for hire between fixed termini or over a regular route upon the waters within this state, including the rivers and lakes and Puget Sound, without first applying for and obtaining from the commission a certificate declaring that public convenience and necessity require such operation. Service authorized by certificates issued to a commercial ferry operator must be exercised by the operator in a manner consistent with the conditions established in the certificate and tariff filed under chapter 81.28 RCW. However, a certificate is not required for a vessel primarily engaged in transporting freight other than vehicles, whose gross earnings from the transportation of passengers or vehicles, or both, are not more than ten percent of the total gross annual earnings of such vessel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the commission finds, after a hearing, that an existing or a proposed commercial ferry service does not serve an essential transportation purpose and is solely for recreation, the commission may, by order, exempt that service from the requirements of certification and regulation under this chapter. If the nonessential service is a proposed service not already provided by an existing certificate holder, the commission must also find, after notice to any existing certificate holder operating within the same territory and an opportunity to be heard, that the proposed service would not adversely affect the rates or services of any existing certificate holder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not affect the right of any county public transportation benefit area or other public agency within this state to construct, condemn, purchase, operate, or maintain, itself or by contract, agreement, or lease, with any person, firm, or corporation, ferries or boats across the waters within this state, including rivers and lakes and Puget Sound, if the operation is not over the same route or between the same districts being served by a certificate holder without first acquiring the rights granted to the certificate holder under the certificate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The holder of a certificate of public convenience and necessity granted under this chapter must initiate service within five years of obtaining the certificate, except that the holder of a certificate of public convenience and necessity for passenger-only ferry service in Puget Sound must initiate service within twenty months of obtaining the certificate. The certificate holder shall report to the commission every six months after the certificate is granted on the progress of the certificated route. The reports shall include, but not be limited to, the progress of environmental impact, parking, local government land use, docking, and financing considerations. Except in the case of passenger-only ferry service in Puget Sound, if service has not been initiated within five years of obtaining the certificate, the commission may extend the certificate on a twelve-month basis for up to three years if the six-month progress reports indicate there is significant advancement toward initiating service.</p>

<li>
<p>Upon the filing of an application, the commission shall give reasonable notice to the department, affected cities, counties, and public transportation benefit areas and any common carrier which might be adversely affected, of the time and place for hearing on such application. The commission may, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, issue the certificate as prayed for, or refuse to issue it, or issue it for the partial exercise only of the privilege sought, and may attach to the exercise of the rights granted by the certificate any terms and conditions as in its judgment the public convenience and necessity may require; but the commission may not grant a certificate to operate between districts or into any territory prohibited by RCW 47.60.120 or already served by an existing certificate holder, unless the existing certificate holder has failed or refused to furnish reasonable and adequate service, has failed to provide the service described in its certificate or tariffs after the time allowed to initiate service has elapsed, or has not objected to the issuance of the certificate as prayed for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before issuing a certificate, the commission shall determine that the applicant has the financial resources to operate the proposed service for at least twelve months, based upon the submission by the applicant of a pro forma financial statement of operations. Issuance of a certificate must be determined upon, but not limited to, the following factors: Ridership and revenue forecasts; the cost of service for the proposed operation; an estimate of the cost of the assets to be used in providing the service; a statement of the total assets on hand of the applicant that will be expended on the proposed operation; and a statement of prior experience, if any, in such field by the applicant. The documentation required of the applicant under this section must comply with the provisions of chapter 5.50 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In granting a certificate for passenger-only ferries and determining what conditions to place on the certificate, the commission shall consider and give substantial weight to the effect of its decisions on public agencies operating, or eligible to operate, passenger-only ferry service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Until July 1, 2007, the commission shall not accept or consider an application for passenger-only ferry service serving any county in the Puget Sound area with a population of over one million people. Applications for passenger-only ferry service serving any county in the Puget Sound area with a population of over one million pending before the commission as of May 9, 2005, must be held in abeyance and not be considered before July 1, 2007.</p>

<p>The commission, in granting a certificate to operate as a commercial ferry, shall require the operator to first obtain liability and property damage insurance from a company licensed to write liability insurance in the state or a surety bond of a company licensed to write surety bonds in the state, on each vessel or ferry to be used, in the amount of not less than one hundred thousand dollars for any recovery for personal injury by one person, and not less than one million dollars and in such additional amount as the commission shall determine, for all persons receiving personal injury and property damage by reason of one act of negligence, and not less than fifty thousand dollars for damage to property of any person other than the insured; or combined bodily injury and property damage liability insurance of not less than one million dollars, and to maintain such liability and property damage insurance or surety bond in force on each vessel or ferry while so used. Each policy for liability or property damage insurance or surety bond required by this section must be filed with the commission and kept in full force and effect, and failure to do so is cause for revocation of the operator's certificate.</p>

Each and every such violation shall be a separate and distinct offense, and in case of a continuing violation every day's continuance shall be and be deemed to be a separate and distinct violation.

<p>The commission may, with or without a hearing, issue temporary certificates to operate under this chapter, but only after it finds that the issuance of the temporary certificate is necessary due to an immediate and urgent need and is otherwise consistent with the public interest.

The commission may prescribe such special rules and impose special terms and conditions on the granting of the certificate as in its judgment are reasonable and necessary in carrying out this chapter. The commission shall collect a filing fee, not to exceed two hundred dollars, for each application for a temporary certificate.
