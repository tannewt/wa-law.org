<p>The need for mobility, growing travel demand, and increasing traffic congestion in urban areas necessitate accelerated development and increased utilization of the high occupancy vehicle system. RCW 81.100.030 and 81.100.060 provide taxing authority that counties or regional transportation investment districts can use in the near term to accelerate development and increase utilization of the high occupancy vehicle system by supplementing available federal, state, and local funds.</p>

<li>A county with a population of one million or more, or a county with a population of from two hundred ten thousand to less than one million that is adjoining a county with a population of one million or more, and having within its boundaries existing or planned high occupancy vehicle lanes on the state highway system, or a regional transportation investment district for capital improvements, but only to the extent that the tax has not already been imposed by the county, may, with voter approval impose an excise tax of up to two dollars per employee per month on all employers or any class or classes of employers, public and private, including the state located in the agency's jurisdiction, measured by the number of full-time equivalent employees. In no event may the total taxes imposed under this section exceed two dollars per employee per month for any single employer.

<p>Existing and anticipated levels of peak-period traffic congestion on roadways used by employees in commuting to work;</p>
