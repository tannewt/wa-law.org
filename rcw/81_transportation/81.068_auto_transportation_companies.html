The commission shall fix the amount of the insurance policy or policies or security deposit by giving due consideration to the character and amount of traffic, the number of persons affected, and the degree of danger that the proposed operation involves. The liability and property damage insurance or surety bond must be maintained in force on the motor-propelled vehicle while in use, and each policy for liability or property damage insurance or surety bond required by this section must be filed with the commission and kept in full force and effect.
