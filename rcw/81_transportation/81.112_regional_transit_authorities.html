<p>The legislature recognizes that existing transportation facilities in the central Puget Sound area are inadequate to address mobility needs of the area. The geography of the region, travel demand growth, and public resistance to new roadways combine to further necessitate the rapid development of alternative modes of travel.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that local governments have been effective in cooperatively planning a multicounty, high capacity transportation system. However, a continued multijurisdictional approach to funding, construction, and operation of a multicounty high capacity transportation system may impair the successful implementation of such a system.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that a single agency will be more effective than several local jurisdictions working collectively at planning, developing, operating, and funding a high capacity transportation system. The single agency's services must be carefully integrated and coordinated with public transportation services currently provided. As the single agency's services are established, any public transportation services currently provided that are duplicative should be eliminated. Further, the single agency must coordinate its activities with other agencies providing local and state roadway services, implementing comprehensive planning, and implementing transportation demand management programs and assist in developing infrastructure to support high capacity systems including but not limited to feeder systems, park and ride facilities, intermodal centers, and related roadway and operational facilities. Coordination can be best achieved through common governance, such as integrated governing boards.</p>
<p>It is therefore the policy of the state of Washington to empower counties in the state's most populous region to create a local agency for planning and implementing a high capacity transportation system within that region. The authorization for such an agency, except as specifically provided in this chapter, is not intended to limit the powers of existing transit agencies.</p>

<p>Two or more contiguous counties each having a population of four hundred thousand persons or more may establish a regional transit authority to develop and operate a high capacity transportation system as defined in chapter 81.104 RCW.</p>
<p>The authority shall be formed in the following manner:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The joint regional policy committee created pursuant to RCW 81.104.040 shall adopt a system and financing plan, including the definition of the service area. This action shall be completed by September 1, 1992, contingent upon satisfactory completion of the planning process defined in RCW 81.104.100. The final system plan shall be adopted no later than June 30, 1993. In addition to the requirements of RCW 81.104.100, the plan for the proposed system shall provide explicitly for a minimum portion of new tax revenues to be allocated to local transit agencies for interim express services. Upon adoption the joint regional policy committee shall immediately transmit the plan to the county legislative authorities within the adopted service area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislative authorities of the counties within the service area shall decide by resolution whether to participate in the authority. This action shall be completed within forty-five days following receipt of the adopted plan or by August 13, 1993, whichever comes first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each county that chooses to participate in the authority shall appoint its board members as set forth in RCW 81.112.040 and shall submit its list of members to the secretary of the Washington state department of transportation. These actions must be completed within thirty days following each county's decision to participate in the authority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The secretary shall call the first meeting of the authority, to be held within thirty days following receipt of the appointments. At its first meeting, the authority shall elect officers and provide for the adoption of rules and other operating procedures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority is formally constituted at its first meeting and the board shall begin taking steps toward implementation of the system and financing plan adopted by the joint regional policy committee. If the joint regional policy committee fails to adopt a plan by June 30, 1993, the authority shall proceed to do so based on the work completed by that date by the joint regional policy committee. Upon formation of the authority, the joint regional policy committee shall cease to exist. The authority may make minor modifications to the plan as deemed necessary and shall at a minimum review local transit agencies' plans to ensure feeder service/high capacity transit service integration, ensure fare integration, and ensure avoidance of parallel competitive services. The authority shall also conduct a minimum thirty-day public comment period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the authority determines that major modifications to the plan are necessary before the initial ballot proposition is submitted to the voters, the authority may make those modifications with a favorable vote of two-thirds of the entire membership. Any such modification shall be subject to the review process set forth in RCW 81.104.110. The modified plan shall be transmitted to the legislative authorities of the participating counties. The legislative authorities shall have forty-five days following receipt to act by motion or ordinance to confirm or rescind their continued participation in the authority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any county opts to not participate in the authority, but two or more contiguous counties do choose to continue to participate, the authority's board shall be revised accordingly. The authority shall, within forty-five days, redefine the system and financing plan to reflect elimination of one or more counties, and submit the redefined plan to the legislative authorities of the remaining counties for their decision as to whether to continue to participate. This action shall be completed within forty-five days following receipt of the redefined plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority shall place on the ballot within two years of the authority's formation, a single ballot proposition to authorize the imposition of taxes to support the implementation of an appropriate phase of the plan within its service area. In addition to the system plan requirements contained in RCW 81.104.100(2)(d), the system plan approved by the authority's board before the submittal of a proposition to the voters shall contain an equity element which:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Identifies revenues anticipated to be generated by corridor and by county within the authority's boundaries;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identifies the phasing of construction and operation of high capacity system facilities, services, and benefits in each corridor. Phasing decisions should give priority to jurisdictions which have adopted transit-supportive land use plans; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identifies the degree to which revenues generated within each county will benefit the residents of that county, and identifies when such benefits will accrue.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A simple majority of those voting within the boundaries of the authority is required for approval. If the vote is affirmative, the authority shall begin implementation of the projects identified in the proposition. However, the authority may not submit any authorizing proposition for voter-approved taxes prior to July 1, 1993; nor may the authority issue bonds or form any local improvement district prior to July 1, 1993.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<p>If the vote on a proposition fails, the board may redefine the proposition, make changes to the authority boundaries, and make corresponding changes to the composition of the board. If the composition of the board is changed, the participating counties shall revise the membership of the board accordingly. The board may then submit the revised proposition or a different proposition to the voters. No single proposition may be submitted to the voters more than twice. Beginning no sooner than the 2007 general election, the authority may place additional propositions on the ballot to impose taxes to support additional phases of plan implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the 2007 general election, the authority shall submit a proposition to support a system and financing plan or additional implementation phases of the authority's system and financing plan as part of a single ballot proposition that includes a plan to support a regional transportation investment plan developed under chapter 36.120 RCW. The authority's plan shall not be considered approved unless both a majority of the persons voting on the proposition residing within the authority vote in favor of the proposition and a majority of the persons voting on the proposition residing within the proposed regional transportation investment district vote in favor of the proposition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional phases of plan implementation may include a transportation subarea equity element which (a) identifies the combined authority and regional transportation investment district revenues anticipated to be generated by corridor and by county within the authority's boundaries, and (b) identifies the degree to which the combined authority and regional transportation investment district revenues generated within each county will benefit the residents of that county, and identifies when such benefits will accrue. For purposes of the transportation subarea equity principle established under this subsection, the authority may use the five subareas within the authority's boundaries as identified in the authority's system plan adopted in May 1996.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the authority is unable to achieve a positive vote on a proposition within two years from the date of the first election on a proposition, the board may, by resolution, reconstitute the authority as a single-county body. With a two-thirds vote of the entire membership of the voting members, the board may also dissolve the authority.</p>

<li>The regional transit authority shall be governed by a board consisting of representatives appointed by the county executive and confirmed by the council or other legislative authority of each member county. Membership shall be based on population from that portion of each county which lies within the service area. Board members shall be appointed initially on the basis of one for each one hundred forty-five thousand population within the county. Such appointments shall be made following consultation with city and town jurisdictions within the service area. In addition, the secretary of transportation or the secretary's designee shall serve as a member of the board and may have voting status with approval of a majority of the other members of the board. Only board members, not including alternates or designees, may cast votes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each member of the board, except the secretary of transportation or the secretary's designee, shall be:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>An elected official who serves on the legislative authority of a city or as mayor of a city within the boundaries of the authority;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the legislative authority of the county, if fifty percent of the population of the legislative official's district is within the authority boundaries; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A county executive from a member county within the authority boundaries.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When making appointments, each county executive shall ensure that representation on the board includes an elected city official representing the largest city in each county and assures proportional representation from other cities, and representation from unincorporated areas of each county within the service area. At least one-half of all appointees from each county shall serve on the governing authority of a public transportation system.</p>
<p>Members appointed from each county shall serve staggered four-year terms. Vacancies shall be filled by appointment for the remainder of the unexpired term of the position being vacated.</p>
<p>The governing board shall be reconstituted, with regard to the number of representatives from each county, on a population basis, using the official office of financial management population estimates, five years after its initial formation and, at minimum, in the year following each official federal census. The board membership may be reduced, maintained, or expanded to reflect population changes but under no circumstances may the board membership exceed twenty-five.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Major decisions of the authority shall require a favorable vote of two-thirds of the entire membership of the voting members. &quot;Major decisions&quot; include at least the following: System plan adoption and amendment; system phasing decisions; annual budget adoption; authorization of annexations; modification of board composition; and executive director employment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each member of the board is eligible to be reimbursed for travel expenses in accordance with RCW 43.03.050 and 43.03.060 and to receive compensation as provided in RCW 43.03.250.</p>

<li>
<p>At the time of formation, the area to be included within the boundary of the authority shall be that area set forth in the system plan adopted by the joint regional policy committee. Prior to submitting the system and financing plan to the voters, the authority may make adjustments to the boundaries as deemed appropriate but must assure that, to the extent possible, the boundaries: (a) Include the largest-population urban growth area designated by each county under chapter 36.70A RCW; and (b) follow election precinct boundaries. If a portion of any city is determined to be within the service area, the entire city must be included within the boundaries of the authority. Subsequent to formation, when territory is annexed to a city located within the boundaries of the authority, the territory is simultaneously included within the boundaries of the authority and subject to all taxes and other liabilities and obligations applicable within the city with respect to the authority as provided in RCW 35.13.500 and 35A.14.475, subject to RCW 84.09.030 and 82.14.055, and notwithstanding any other provision of law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After voters within the authority boundaries have approved the system and financing plan, elections to add areas contiguous to the authority boundaries may be called by resolution of the regional transit authority, after consultation with affected transit agencies and with the concurrence of the legislative authority of the city or town if the area is incorporated, or with the concurrence of the county legislative authority if the area is unincorporated. Only those areas that would benefit from the services provided by the authority may be included and services or projects proposed for the area must be consistent with the regional transportation plan. The election may include a single ballot proposition providing for annexation to the authority boundaries and imposition of the taxes at rates already imposed within the authority boundaries, subject to RCW 84.09.030 and 82.14.055.</p>

<p>In addition to the powers specifically granted by this chapter an authority shall have all powers necessary to implement a high capacity transportation system and to develop revenues for system support. An authority may contract with the United States or any agency thereof, any state or agency thereof, any public transportation benefit area, any county, county transportation authority, city, metropolitan municipal corporation, special district, or governmental agency, within or without the state, and any private person, firm, or corporation for: (1) The purpose of receiving gifts or grants or securing loans or advances for preliminary planning and feasibility studies; (2) the design, construction, or operation of high capacity transportation system facilities; or (3) the provision or receipt of services, facilities, or property rights to provide revenues for the system. An authority shall have the power to contract pursuant to RCW 39.33.050. In addition, an authority may contract with any governmental agency or with any private person, firm, or corporation for the use by either contracting party of all or any part of the facilities, structures, lands, interests in lands, air rights over lands and rights-of-way of all kinds which are owned, leased, or held by the other party and for the purpose of planning, constructing, or operating any facility or performing any service that the authority may be authorized to operate or perform, on such terms as may be agreed upon by the contracting parties. Before any contract for the lease or operation of any authority facilities is let to any private person, firm, or corporation, a general schedule of rental rates for equipment with or without operators applicable to all private certificated carriers shall be publicly posted, and for other facilities competitive bids shall first be called upon such notice, bidder qualifications, and bid conditions as the board shall determine.

<li>
<p>The financial institution, insurance company, or other entity that enters into a payment undertaking agreement with the regional transit authority or public development corporation or entity created under RCW 81.112.320 as a counterparty must have a rating from at least two nationally recognized credit rating agencies, as of the date of execution of the payment undertaking agreement, that is within the two highest long-term investment grade rating categories, without regard to subcategories, or the obligations of the counterparty must be guaranteed by a financial institution, insurance company, or other entity with that credit rating. The payment undertaking agreement must require that the obligations of the counterparty or the guarantor, as the case may be, must be collateralized by collateral of a type and in an amount specified by the governing body of the regional transit authority if the credit ratings of the counterparty or its guarantor fall below the level required by this subsection.</p>

A certification by an independent financial expert, banker, or certified public accountant, who is not an employee of the regional transit authority or public corporation or entity created under RCW 81.112.320, certifying compliance with this requirement is conclusive evidence that the arrangements, by their terms, comply with the requirement under this subsection on the sufficiency of the amount.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The payment undertaking agreements, and all other basic and material agreements entered into in connection with the transactions, must specify that the parties to the agreements consent to the jurisdiction of state courts of Washington for disputes arising out of the agreements and agree not to contest venue before such courts. Regardless of the choice of law specified in the foregoing agreements, the agreements must acknowledge that the regional transit authority or public development corporation or entity created under RCW 81.112.320 that is a party to the agreements is an entity created under the laws of the state of Washington whose power and authority and limitations and restrictions on the power and authority are governed by the laws of the state of Washington.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Payment undertaking agreements that meet the foregoing requirement must be treated for all relevant purposes as agreements under which future services are performed for a present payment and shall not be treated as payment agreements within the meaning of chapter 39.96 RCW.</p>
