<p>The legislature finds and declares that privately operated taxicab transportation service is a vital part of the transportation system within the state and provides demand-responsive services to state residents, tourists, and out-of-state business people. Consequently, the safety, reliability, and economic viability and stability of privately operated taxicab transportation service are matters of statewide importance. The regulation of privately operated taxicab transportation services is thus an essential governmental function. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to permit political subdivisions of the state to regulate taxicab transportation services without liability under federal antitrust laws.</p>
