<p>State and national policy directs that the management of low-level radioactive waste be accomplished by a system of interstate compacts and the development of regional disposal sites. The Northwest regional compact, comprised of the states of Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, and Washington, has as its disposal facility the low-level radioactive waste disposal site located near Richland, Washington. This site is expected to be the sole site for disposal of low-level radioactive waste for compact members effective January 1, 1993. Future closure of this site will require significant financial resources.</p>
<p>Low-level radioactive waste is generated by essential activities and services that benefit the citizens of the state. Washington state's low-level radioactive waste disposal site has been used by the nation and the Northwest compact as a disposal site since 1965. The public has come to rely on access to this site for disposal of low-level radioactive waste, which requires separate handling from other solid and hazardous wastes. The price of disposing of low-level radioactive waste at the Washington state low-level radioactive waste disposal site is anticipated to increase when the federal low-level radioactive waste policy amendments act of 1985 is implemented and waste generated outside the Northwest compact states is excluded.</p>
<p>When these events occur, to protect Washington and other Northwest compact states' businesses and services, such as electrical production, medical and university research, and private industries, upon which the public relies, there will be a need to regulate the rates charged by the operator of Washington's low-level radioactive waste disposal site. This chapter is adopted pursuant to section 8, chapter 21, Laws of 1990.</p>

<p>The commission shall establish rates to be charged by site operators. In establishing the rates, the commission shall assure that they are fair, just, reasonable, and sufficient considering the value of the site operator's leasehold and license interests, the unique nature of its business operations, the site operator's liability associated with the site, its investment incurred over the term of its operations, and the rate of return equivalent to that earned by comparable enterprises.

<p>Upon establishment of a contract rate pursuant to RCW 81.108.060 for a disposal fee, the site operator may not collect a disposal fee that is greater than the effective rate. The effective rate shall be in effect so long as such contract rate remains in effect. Adjustments to the maximum disposal rates may be made during the time an effective rate is in place. Contracts for disposal of extraordinary volumes pursuant to RCW 81.108.070 shall not be considered in determining the effective rate.</p>
