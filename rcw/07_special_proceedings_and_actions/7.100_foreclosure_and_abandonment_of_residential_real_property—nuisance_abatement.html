<p>In the event a mortgage servicer is contacted by the borrower and notified that the property is not abandoned, the mortgage servicer must so notify the county, city, or town and thereafter neither the mortgage servicer nor its designee may enter the property regardless of whether the property constitutes a nuisance or complies with local code enforcement standards.</p>
</li>
