1. On all parties named therein, and their legal representatives who have at the time any interest in the property divided, or any part thereof as owners in fee, or as tenants for life or for years, or as entitled to the reversion, remainder or inheritance of such property or any part thereof, after the termination of a particular estate therein, or who by any contingency may be entitled to a beneficial interest in the property, or who have an interest in any undivided share thereof, as tenants for years or for life.
