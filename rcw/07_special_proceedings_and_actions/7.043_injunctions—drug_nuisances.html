<p>The action provided for in RCW 7.43.010 shall be brought in the superior court in the county in which the property is located. Such action shall be commenced by the filing of a complaint alleging the facts constituting the nuisance.</p>
<p>Any complaint filed under this chapter shall be verified or accompanied by affidavit. For purposes of showing that the owner or his or her agent has had an opportunity to abate the nuisance, the affidavit shall contain a description of all attempts by the applicant to notify and locate the owner of the property or the owner's agent.</p>
<p>In addition, the affidavit shall describe in detail the adverse impact associated with the property on the surrounding neighborhood. &quot;Adverse impact&quot; includes, but is not limited to, the following: Any search warrants served on the property where controlled substances were seized; investigative purchases of controlled substances on or near the property by law enforcement or their agents; arrests of persons who frequent the property for violation of controlled substances laws; increased volume of traffic associated with the property; and the number of complaints made to law enforcement of illegal activity associated with the property.</p>
<p>After filing the complaint, the court shall grant a hearing within three business days after the filing.</p>
<p>[ <a href="http://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1988c141.pdf?cite=1988%20c%20141%20%C2%A7%205">1988 c 141 § 5</a>; ]</p>

<p>Upon application for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction, the court may, upon a showing of good cause, issue an ex parte restraining order or preliminary injunction, preventing the defendant and all other persons from removing or in any manner interfering with the personal property and contents of the place where the nuisance is alleged to exist and may grant such preliminary equitable relief as is necessary to prevent the continuance or recurrence of the nuisance pending final resolution of the matter on the merits. However, pending the decision, the stock in trade may not be so restrained, but an inventory and full accounting of all business transactions may be required.</p>
<p>The restraining order or preliminary injunction may be served by handing to and leaving a copy with any person in charge of the place or residing in the place, or by posting a copy in a conspicuous place at or upon one or more of the principal doors or entrances to the place, or by both delivery and posting. The officer serving the order or injunction shall forthwith make and return into court an inventory of the personal property and contents situated in and used in conducting or maintaining the nuisance.</p>
<p>Any violation of the order or injunction is a contempt of court, and where such order or injunction is posted, mutilation or removal thereof while the same remains in force is a contempt of court if such posted order or injunction contains a notice to that effect.</p>

A bond or security shall not be required of the state of Washington, municipal corporations, or political subdivisions of the state of Washington.</p>

<p>If the court finds and concludes that the owner of the building or unit within a building: (a) Had no knowledge of the existence of the nuisance or has been making reasonable efforts to abate the nuisance, (b) has not been guilty of any contempt of court in the proceedings, and (c) will immediately abate any such nuisance that may exist at the building or unit within a building and prevent it from being a nuisance within a period of one year thereafter, the court shall, if satisfied of the owner's good faith, order the building or unit within a building to be delivered to the owner, and no order of abatement shall be entered. If an order of abatement has been entered and the owner subsequently meets the requirements of this subsection, the order of abatement shall be canceled.</p>

<p>A building or unit within a building shall not be sold under this section unless the court finds and concludes by clear and convincing evidence that the owner of the building or unit within a building had actual or constructive knowledge or notice of the existence of the nuisance. However, this shall not be construed as limiting or prohibiting the entry of any final order of abatement as provided in this chapter.</p>
