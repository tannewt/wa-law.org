<li>
<p>For the purposes of this chapter, &quot;arbitration agreement&quot; is an agreement by the parties to submit to arbitration all or certain disputes which have arisen or which may arise between them in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether contractual or not. An arbitration agreement may be in the form of an arbitration clause in a contract or in the form of a separate agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The arbitration agreement shall be in writing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An arbitration agreement is in writing if its content is recorded in any form, whether or not the arbitration agreement or contract has been concluded orally, by conduct, or by other means.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The requirement that an arbitration agreement be in writing is met by an electronic communication if the information contained therein is accessible so as to be useable for subsequent reference. For the purposes of this section, &quot;electronic communication&quot; means any communication that the parties make by means of data messages; and &quot;data message&quot; means information generated, sent, received, or stored by electronic, magnetic, optical, or similar means, including, but not limited to, electronic data interchange (EDI), electronic mail, telegram, telex, or telecopy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An arbitration agreement is in writing if it is contained in an exchange of statements of claim and defense in which the existence of an agreement is alleged by one party and not denied by the other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reference in a contract to any document containing an arbitration clause constitutes an arbitration agreement in writing, provided that the reference is such as to make that clause part of the contract.</p>

<p>A court before which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement shall, if a party so requests not later than when submitting the party's first statement on the substance of the dispute, refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds that the agreement is null and void, inoperative, or incapable of being performed.</p>

<li>A decision on a matter entrusted by subsection (3) or (4) of this section to the court specified in RCW 7.05.070 shall be subject to no appeal.
