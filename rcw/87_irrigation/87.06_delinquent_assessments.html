<p>Before preparing a certificate of delinquency, the treasurer of a district that has designated its own treasurer as provided in RCW 87.03.440 , shall provide to the board of directors a list of properties that may be subject to foreclosure for delinquent assessments. The board of directors shall review the list of delinquent properties. After comparing the amount of the delinquent assessment with the costs of foreclosure, including but not limited to title search, court filing fees, costs of service, and attorneys' fees, the board of directors may determine that it is not in the best interest of the district to commence legal action to foreclose the delinquent assessment liens. Nothing in this section precludes a county treasurer from proceeding with foreclosure on parcels otherwise delinquent and, in those actions, from collecting delinquent assessments due under this title.</p>

<li>
<p>After the completion of the title searches, the treasurer, in the name of the irrigation district, shall commence legal action to foreclose on the assessment liens. The treasurer shall give notice of application for judgment foreclosing assessment liens and summons to all parties in interest as disclosed by the title search. The treasurer may include in any notice any number of separate properties. Such notice and summons shall contain:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A statement that the irrigation district is applying to superior court of the county in which the property is located for a judgment foreclosing the lien against the property for delinquent assessments, costs, and interest;</p>
</li>

<p>The full name of the superior court in which the district is applying for the judgment; and for each property: The description of the property, the local street address (if any), and the name of each party in interest;</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>A direction to each party in interest summoning the party to appear within sixty days after service of the notice and summons, exclusive of the day of the service, and defend the action or pay the lien amount due; and when service is made by publication, a direction summoning each party to appear within sixty days after the date of the first publication of the notice and summons, exclusive of the day of first publication, and defend the action or pay the amount due;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A notice that, in case of failure to defend or pay the amount due, judgment will be rendered foreclosing the lien of the assessments, costs, and interest against the property; and</p>

<li>
<p>The date, time, and place of the foreclosure sale as specified in the application for judgment.</p>

<li>
<p>The treasurer shall record in the office of the auditor of the county in which the property is located a notice of lis pendens before commencing the service of the notice and summons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The notice and summons shall be served in a manner reasonably calculated to inform each party in interest of the foreclosure action. At a minimum, service shall be accomplished by either (a) personal service upon a party in interest, or (b) publication once in a newspaper of general circulation that is circulated in the area in which the property is located and mailing of notice by certified mail to the party in interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notice and summons need not be served on holders of easements on the property if the easements are a matter of public record in the auditor's office of the county in which the property is located. Any foreclosure of delinquent assessments on any tract, lot, or parcel of real property subject to such easement or easements, and any treasurer's deed subsequently issued, is subject to such easement or easements that were established of record before the date of the certificate of delinquency for which the delinquent assessment was foreclosed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It shall be the duty of the treasurer to mail a copy of the notice and summons, within fifteen days after the first publication or service thereof, to the treasurer of each county, city, or town within which any property involved in an assessment foreclosure is situated, but the treasurer's failure to do so shall not affect the jurisdiction of the court nor the priority of any assessment lien sought to be foreclosed.</p>

<p>Any party in interest of property for which a certificate of delinquency has been prepared, but against which a foreclosure judgment has not been entered, may pay to the treasurer, in person or by agent, the total amount of the assessment lien, as listed under RCW 87.06.020(1)(d), plus any additional costs and interest, including any title search costs. If a foreclosure judgment has been entered, then any party in interest may pay to the treasurer, in person or by agent, the lien amount for which the judgment has been rendered, so long as payment is received by the treasurer during regular business hours before the day of the foreclosure sale. The treasurer shall give a receipt for each payment received under this subsection.</p>

<p>The proceedings to foreclose the liens against all properties on a general certificate of delinquency or on more than one individual certificate may be brought in one action.</p>

<p>No assessment, costs, or interest may be considered illegal because of any irregularity in the assessment roll or because the assessment roll has not been made, completed, or returned within the time required by law, or because the property has been charged or listed in the assessment roll without name, or in any other name than that of the owner, and no error or informality in the proceedings of any of the officers connected with the assessment may invalidate or in any other manner affect the assessment thereof. Any irregularities or informality in the assessment roll or in any of the proceedings connected with the assessment or any omission or defective act of any officer or officers connected with the assessment may be, at the discretion of the court corrected, supplied, and made to conform to the law by the court. This subsection does not apply if the court finds that the failure to conform to the law unfairly prejudices a party with an interest in the property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A party with an interest in real property subject to foreclosure within the district may file a written answer within the time permitted by RCW 87.06.040(1)(d) asserting an objection or defense to the entry of a foreclosure judgment against the property. However, defenses or objections shall be limited to: (a) The form of pleading; (b) manner of service; (c) invalidity of the assessments claimed delinquent; (d) payment of the assessments claimed delinquent; or (e) that the real property against which foreclosure is sought is not subject to district assessment. No counterclaim shall be permitted. The court shall liberally permit amendment or supplementation of the district's challenged pleading or procedure to cure the claimed defect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court shall determine timely objections or defenses to the district's foreclosure in a summary proceeding based only on the district's pleading and the interested party's answer and shall promptly pronounce judgment granting or denying the foreclosure; or the court may, in its discretion, to provide substantial justice to the parties, continue the case to a later time to hear evidence on the issues raised by the answer. Hearings under this section shall be limited to affidavits or declarations, and shall be expedited.</p>
