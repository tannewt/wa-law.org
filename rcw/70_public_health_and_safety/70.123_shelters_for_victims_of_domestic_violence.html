<li>
<p>The legislature finds that domestic violence is an issue of serious concern at all levels of society and government and that there is a pressing need for innovative strategies to address and prevent domestic violence and to strengthen services which will ameliorate and reduce the trauma of domestic violence and enhance survivors' resiliency and autonomy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that there are a wide range of consequences to domestic violence, including deaths, injuries, hospitalizations, homelessness, employment problems, property damage, and lifelong physical and psychological impacts on victims and their children. These impacts also affect victims' friends and families, neighbors, employers, landlords, law enforcement, the courts, the health care system, and Washington state and society as a whole. Advocacy and shelters for victims of domestic violence are essential to provide support to victims in preventing further abuse and to help victims assess and plan for their immediate and longer term safety, including finding long-range alternative living situations, if requested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus, it is the intent of the legislature to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Provide for a statewide network of supportive services, emergency shelter services, and advocacy for victims of domestic violence and their dependents;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide for culturally relevant and appropriate services for victims of domestic violence and their children from populations that have been traditionally unserved or underserved;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide for a statewide domestic violence information and referral resource;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assist communities in efforts to increase public awareness about, and primary and secondary prevention of domestic violence;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of current information related to emerging issues and model and promising practices related to preventing and intervening in situations involving domestic violence; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide for ongoing training and technical assistance for individuals working with victims in community-based domestic violence programs and other persons seeking such training and technical assistance.</p>
