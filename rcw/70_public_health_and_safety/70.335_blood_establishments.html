<p>The legislature finds that maintaining public trust and confidence in the safety of the community blood supply is important to the health care system. Patients in Washington needing lifesaving transfusions rightly expect safe blood and blood donors in Washington rightly expect their contributions will be managed with diligent care and compliance with all regulatory standards and expectations so their donation will benefit patients in need. The United States food and drug administration establishes regulations, good manufacturing practices, and guidance that defines the minimum standards for blood establishments and, in cases of repeated violations and noncompliance by licensed blood establishments, may impose measures that include fines, judicial consent decrees, and suspension or revocation of licensure. It is therefore the intent of the legislature that blood-collecting or distributing establishments be registered with the department of health to help ensure public transparency.</p>
