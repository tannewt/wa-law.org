<li>
<p>The legislature finds that limitations on access to health care services for enrollees in the state, such as in rural and underserved areas, are particularly challenging for the basic health plan. Statutory restrictions have reduced the options available to the director to address the access needs of basic health plan enrollees. It is the intent of the legislature to authorize the director to develop alternative purchasing strategies to ensure access to basic health plan enrollees in all areas of the state, including: (i) The use of differential rating for managed health care systems based on geographic differences in costs; and (ii) limited use of self-insurance in areas where adequate access cannot be assured through other options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In developing alternative purchasing strategies to address health care access needs, the director shall consult with interested persons including health carriers, health care providers, and health facilities, and with other appropriate state agencies including the office of the insurance commissioner and the office of community and rural health. In pursuing such alternatives, the director shall continue to give priority to prepaid managed care as the preferred method of assuring access to basic health plan enrollees followed, in priority order, by preferred providers, fee-for-service, and self-funding.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A significant percentage of the population of this state does not have reasonably available insurance or other coverage of the costs of necessary basic health care services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This lack of basic health care coverage is detrimental to the health of the individuals lacking coverage and to the public welfare, and results in substantial expenditures for emergency and remedial health care, often at the expense of health care providers, health care facilities, and all purchasers of health care, including the state; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of managed health care systems has significant potential to reduce the growth of health care costs incurred by the people of this state generally, and by low-income pregnant women, and at-risk children and adolescents who need greater access to managed health care.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to provide or make more readily available necessary basic health care services in an appropriate setting to working persons and others who lack coverage, at a cost to these persons that does not create barriers to the utilization of necessary health care services. To that end, this chapter establishes a program to be made available to those residents not eligible for medicare who share in a portion of the cost or who pay the full cost of receiving basic health care services from a managed health care system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not the intent of this chapter to provide health care services for those persons who are presently covered through private employer-based health plans, nor to replace employer-based health plans. However, the legislature recognizes that cost-effective and affordable health plans may not always be available to small business employers. Further, it is the intent of the legislature to expand, wherever possible, the availability of private health care coverage and to discourage the decline of employer-based coverage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>It is the purpose of this chapter to acknowledge the initial success of this program that has (i) assisted thousands of families in their search for affordable health care; (ii) demonstrated that low-income, uninsured families are willing to pay for their own health care coverage to the extent of their ability to pay; and (iii) proved that local health care providers are willing to enter into a public-private partnership as a managed care system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a consequence, the legislature intends to extend an option to enroll to certain citizens above two hundred percent of the federal poverty guidelines within the state who reside in communities where the plan is operational and who collectively or individually wish to exercise the opportunity to purchase health care coverage through the basic health plan if the purchase is done at no cost to the state. It is also the intent of the legislature to allow employers and other financial sponsors to financially assist such individuals to purchase health care through the program so long as such purchase does not result in a lower standard of coverage for employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends that, to the extent of available funds, the program be available throughout Washington state to subsidized and nonsubsidized enrollees. It is also the intent of the legislature to enroll subsidized enrollees first, to the maximum extent feasible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature directs that the basic health plan director identify enrollees who are likely to be eligible for medical assistance and assist these individuals in applying for and receiving medical assistance. Enrollees receiving medical assistance are not eligible for the Washington basic health plan.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that the basic health plan has been an effective program in providing health coverage for uninsured residents. Further, since 1993, substantial amounts of public funds have been allocated for subsidized basic health plan enrollment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Effective January 1, 1996, basic health plan enrollees whose income is less than one hundred twenty-five percent of the federal poverty level shall pay at least a ten-dollar premium share.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No later than July 1, 1996, the *administrator shall implement procedures whereby hospitals licensed under chapters 70.41 and 71.12 RCW, health carrier, rural health care facilities regulated under chapter 70.175 RCW, and community and migrant health centers funded under RCW 41.05.220, may expeditiously assist patients and their families in applying for basic health plan or medical assistance coverage, and in submitting such applications directly to the health care authority or the department of social and health services. The health care authority and the department of social and health services shall make every effort to simplify and expedite the application and enrollment process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No later than July 1, 1996, the *administrator shall implement procedures whereby disability insurance producers, licensed under chapter 48.17 RCW, may expeditiously assist patients and their families in applying for basic health plan or medical assistance coverage, and in submitting such applications directly to the health care authority or the department of social and health services. Insurance producers may receive a commission for each individual sale of the basic health plan to anyone not signed up within the previous five years and a commission for each group sale of the basic health plan, if funding for this purpose is provided in a specific appropriation to the health care authority. No commission shall be provided upon a renewal. Commissions shall be determined based on the estimated annual cost of the basic health plan, however, commissions shall not result in a reduction in the premium amount paid to health carriers. For purposes of this section &quot;health carrier&quot; is as defined in RCW 48.43.005. The *administrator may establish: (a) Minimum educational requirements that must be completed by the insurance producers; (b) an appointment process for insurance producers marketing the basic health plan; or (c) standards for revocation of the appointment of an insurance producer to submit applications for cause, including untrustworthy or incompetent conduct or harm to the public. The health care authority and the department of social and health services shall make every effort to simplify and expedite the application and enrollment process.</p>

<p>The *administrator has the following powers and duties:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To design and from time to time revise a schedule of covered basic health care services, including physician services, inpatient and outpatient hospital services, prescription drugs and medications, and other services that may be necessary for basic health care. In addition, the *administrator may, to the extent that funds are available, offer as basic health plan services chemical dependency services, mental health services, and organ transplant services. All subsidized and nonsubsidized enrollees in any participating managed health care system under the Washington basic health plan shall be entitled to receive covered basic health care services in return for premium payments to the plan. The schedule of services shall emphasize proven preventive and primary health care and shall include all services necessary for prenatal, postnatal, and well-child care. However, with respect to coverage for subsidized enrollees who are eligible to receive prenatal and postnatal services through the medical assistance program under chapter 74.09 RCW, the *administrator shall not contract for such services except to the extent that such services are necessary over not more than a one-month period in order to maintain continuity of care after diagnosis of pregnancy by the managed care provider. The schedule of services shall also include a separate schedule of basic health care services for children, eighteen years of age and younger, for those subsidized or nonsubsidized enrollees who choose to secure basic coverage through the plan only for their dependent children. In designing and revising the schedule of services, the *administrator shall consider the guidelines for assessing health services under the mandated benefits act of 1984, RCW 48.47.030, and such other factors as the *administrator deems appropriate. The *administrator shall encourage enrollees who have been continually enrolled on basic health for a period of one year or more to complete a health risk assessment and participate in programs approved by the *administrator that may include wellness, smoking cessation, and chronic disease management programs. In approving programs, the *administrator shall consider evidence that any such programs are proven to improve enrollee health status.</p>
</li>
<li>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>To design and implement a structure of periodic premiums due the *administrator from subsidized enrollees that is based upon gross family income, giving appropriate consideration to family size and the ages of all family members. The enrollment of children shall not require the enrollment of their parent or parents who are eligible for the plan. The structure of periodic premiums shall be applied to subsidized enrollees entering the plan as individuals pursuant to subsection (11) of this section and to the share of the cost of the plan due from subsidized enrollees entering the plan as employees pursuant to subsection (12) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To determine the periodic premiums due the *administrator from subsidized enrollees under **RCW 70.47.020(9)(b). Premiums due for foster parents with gross family income up to two hundred percent of the federal poverty level shall be set at the minimum premium amount charged to enrollees with income below sixty-five percent of the federal poverty level. Premiums due for foster parents with gross family income between two hundred percent and three hundred percent of the federal poverty level shall not exceed one hundred dollars per month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To determine the periodic premiums due the *administrator from nonsubsidized enrollees. Premiums due from nonsubsidized enrollees shall be in an amount equal to the cost charged by the managed health care system provider to the state for the plan plus the administrative cost of providing the plan to those enrollees and the premium tax under RCW 48.14.0201.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To determine the periodic premiums due the *administrator from health coverage tax credit eligible enrollees. Premiums due from health coverage tax credit eligible enrollees must be in an amount equal to the cost charged by the managed health care system provider to the state for the plan, plus the administrative cost of providing the plan to those enrollees and the premium tax under RCW 48.14.0201. The *administrator will consider the impact of eligibility determination by the appropriate federal agency designated by the Trade Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-210) as well as the premium collection and remittance activities by the United States internal revenue service when determining the administrative cost charged for health coverage tax credit eligible enrollees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An employer or other financial sponsor may, with the prior approval of the *administrator, pay the premium, rate, or any other amount on behalf of a subsidized or nonsubsidized enrollee, by arrangement with the enrollee and through a mechanism acceptable to the *administrator. The *administrator shall establish a mechanism for receiving premium payments from the United States internal revenue service for health coverage tax credit eligible enrollees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To develop, as an offering by every health carrier providing coverage identical to the basic health plan, as configured on January 1, 2001, a basic health plan model plan with uniformity in enrollee cost-sharing requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To collect from all public employees a voluntary opt-in donation of varying amounts through a monthly or one-time payroll deduction as provided for in RCW 41.04.230. The donation must be deposited in the health services account established in ***RCW 43.72.900 to be used for the sole purpose of maintaining enrollment capacity in the basic health plan.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The *administrator shall send an annual notice to state employees extending the opportunity to participate in the opt-in donation program for the purpose of saving enrollment slots for the basic health plan. The first such notice shall be sent to public employees no later than June 1, 2009.</p>
<p>The notice shall include monthly sponsorship levels of fifteen dollars per month, thirty dollars per month, fifty dollars per month, and any other amounts deemed reasonable by the *administrator. The sponsorship levels shall be named &quot;safety net contributor,&quot; &quot;safety net hero,&quot; and &quot;safety net champion&quot; respectively. The donation amounts provided shall be tied to the level of coverage the employee will be purchasing for a working poor individual without access to health care coverage.</p>
<p>The *administrator shall ensure that employees are given an opportunity to establish a monthly standard deduction or a one-time deduction towards the basic health plan donation program. The basic health plan donation program shall be known as the &quot;save the safety net program.&quot;</p>
<p>The donation permitted under this subsection may not be collected from any public employee who does not actively opt in to the donation program. Written notification of intent to discontinue participation in the donation program must be provided by the public employee at least fourteen days prior to the next standard deduction.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>To evaluate, with the cooperation of participating managed health care system providers, the impact on the basic health plan of enrolling health coverage tax credit eligible enrollees. The *administrator shall issue to the appropriate committees of the legislature preliminary evaluations on June 1, 2005, and January 1, 2006, and a final evaluation by June 1, 2006. The evaluation shall address the number of persons enrolled, the duration of their enrollment, their utilization of covered services relative to other basic health plan enrollees, and the extent to which their enrollment contributed to any change in the cost of the basic health plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To end the participation of health coverage tax credit eligible enrollees in the basic health plan if the federal government reduces or terminates premium payments on their behalf through the United States internal revenue service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To design and implement a structure of enrollee cost-sharing due a managed health care system from subsidized, nonsubsidized, and health coverage tax credit eligible enrollees. The structure shall discourage inappropriate enrollee utilization of health care services, and may utilize copayments, deductibles, and other cost-sharing mechanisms, but shall not be so costly to enrollees as to constitute a barrier to appropriate utilization of necessary health care services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To limit enrollment of persons who qualify for subsidies so as to prevent an overexpenditure of appropriations for such purposes. Whenever the *administrator finds that there is danger of such an overexpenditure, the *administrator shall close enrollment until the *administrator finds the danger no longer exists. Such a closure does not apply to health coverage tax credit eligible enrollees who receive a premium subsidy from the United States internal revenue service as long as the enrollees qualify for the health coverage tax credit program. To prevent the risk of overexpenditure, the *administrator may disenroll persons receiving subsidies from the program based on criteria adopted by the *administrator. The criteria may include: Length of continual enrollment on the program, income level, or eligibility for other coverage. The *administrator shall identify enrollees who are eligible for other coverage, and, working with the department of social and health service as provided in RCW 70.47.010(5)(d), transition enrollees currently eligible for federally financed categorically needy or medically needy programs administered under chapter 74.09 RCW to that coverage. The *administrator shall develop criteria for persons disenrolled under this subsection to reapply for the program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To limit the payment of subsidies to subsidized enrollees, as defined in RCW 70.47.020. The level of subsidy provided to persons who qualify may be based on the lowest cost plans, as defined by the *administrator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To adopt a schedule for the orderly development of the delivery of services and availability of the plan to residents of the state, subject to the limitations contained in RCW 70.47.080 or any act appropriating funds for the plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To solicit and accept applications from managed health care systems, as defined in this chapter, for inclusion as eligible basic health care providers under the plan for subsidized enrollees, nonsubsidized enrollees, or health coverage tax credit eligible enrollees. The *administrator shall endeavor to assure that covered basic health care services are available to any enrollee of the plan from among a selection of two or more participating managed health care systems. In adopting any rules or procedures applicable to managed health care systems and in its dealings with such systems, the *administrator shall consider and make suitable allowance for the need for health care services and the differences in local availability of health care resources, along with other resources, within and among the several areas of the state. Contracts with participating managed health care systems shall ensure that basic health plan enrollees who become eligible for medical assistance may, at their option, continue to receive services from their existing providers within the managed health care system if such providers have entered into provider agreements with the department of social and health services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To receive periodic premiums from or on behalf of subsidized, nonsubsidized, and health coverage tax credit eligible enrollees, deposit them in the basic health plan operating account, keep records of enrollee status, and authorize periodic payments to managed health care systems on the basis of the number of enrollees participating in the respective managed health care systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To accept applications from individuals residing in areas served by the plan, on behalf of themselves and their spouses and dependent children, for enrollment in the Washington basic health plan as subsidized, nonsubsidized, or health coverage tax credit eligible enrollees, to give priority to members of the Washington national guard and reserves who served in Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, or Operation Noble Eagle, and their spouses and dependents, for enrollment in the Washington basic health plan, to establish appropriate minimum-enrollment periods for enrollees as may be necessary, and to determine, upon application and on a reasonable schedule defined by the authority, or at the request of any enrollee, eligibility due to current gross family income for sliding scale premiums. The application is also considered an application for medical assistance under chapter 74.09 RCW and must include a social security number, if available, for each family member requesting coverage. Funds received by a family as part of participation in the adoption support program authorized under RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080 shall not be counted toward a family's current gross family income for the purposes of this chapter. When an enrollee fails to report income or income changes accurately, the *administrator shall have the authority either to bill the enrollee for the amounts overpaid by the state or to impose civil penalties of up to two hundred percent of the amount of subsidy overpaid due to the enrollee incorrectly reporting income. The *administrator shall adopt rules to define the appropriate application of these sanctions and the processes to implement the sanctions provided in this subsection, within available resources. No subsidy may be paid with respect to any enrollee whose current gross family income exceeds twice the federal poverty level or, subject to RCW 70.47.110, who is a recipient of medical assistance or medical care services under chapter 74.09 RCW. If a number of enrollees drop their enrollment for no apparent good cause, the *administrator may establish appropriate rules or requirements that are applicable to such individuals before they will be allowed to reenroll in the plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To accept applications from business owners on behalf of themselves and their employees, spouses, and dependent children, as subsidized or nonsubsidized enrollees, who reside in an area served by the plan. The *administrator may require all or the substantial majority of the eligible employees of such businesses to enroll in the plan and establish those procedures necessary to facilitate the orderly enrollment of groups in the plan and into a managed health care system. The *administrator may require that a business owner pay at least an amount equal to what the employee pays after the state pays its portion of the subsidized premium cost of the plan on behalf of each employee enrolled in the plan. Enrollment is limited to those not eligible for medicare who wish to enroll in the plan and choose to obtain the basic health care coverage and services from a managed care system participating in the plan. The *administrator shall adjust the amount determined to be due on behalf of or from all such enrollees whenever the amount negotiated by the *administrator with the participating managed health care system or systems is modified or the administrative cost of providing the plan to such enrollees changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To determine the rate to be paid to each participating managed health care system in return for the provision of covered basic health care services to enrollees in the system. Although the schedule of covered basic health care services will be the same or actuarially equivalent for similar enrollees, the rates negotiated with participating managed health care systems may vary among the systems. In negotiating rates with participating systems, the *administrator shall consider the characteristics of the populations served by the respective systems, economic circumstances of the local area, the need to conserve the resources of the basic health plan trust account, and other factors the *administrator finds relevant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To monitor the provision of covered services to enrollees by participating managed health care systems in order to assure enrollee access to good quality basic health care, to require periodic data reports concerning the utilization of health care services rendered to enrollees in order to provide adequate information for evaluation, and to inspect the books and records of participating managed health care systems to assure compliance with the purposes of this chapter. In requiring reports from participating managed health care systems, including data on services rendered enrollees, the *administrator shall endeavor to minimize costs, both to the managed health care systems and to the plan. The *administrator shall coordinate any such reporting requirements with other state agencies, such as the insurance commissioner and the department of health, to minimize duplication of effort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To evaluate the effects this chapter has on private employer-based health care coverage and to take appropriate measures consistent with state and federal statutes that will discourage the reduction of such coverage in the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To develop a program of proven preventive health measures and to integrate it into the plan wherever possible and consistent with this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide, consistent with available funding, assistance for rural residents, underserved populations, and persons of color.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In consultation with appropriate state and local government agencies, to establish criteria defining eligibility for persons confined or residing in government-operated institutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To administer the premium discounts provided under RCW 48.41.200(3)(a) (i) and (ii) pursuant to a contract with the Washington state health insurance pool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To give priority in enrollment to persons who disenrolled from the program in order to enroll in medicaid, and subsequently became ineligible for medicaid coverage.</p>

<p>A managed health care system participating in the plan shall do so by contract with the director and shall provide, directly or by contract with other health care providers, covered basic health care services to each enrollee covered by its contract with the director as long as payments from the director on behalf of the enrollee are current. A participating managed health care system may offer, without additional cost, health care benefits or services not included in the schedule of covered services under the plan. A participating managed health care system shall not give preference in enrollment to enrollees who accept such additional health care benefits or services. Managed health care systems participating in the plan shall not discriminate against any potential or current enrollee based upon health status, sex, race, ethnicity, or religion. The director may receive and act upon complaints from enrollees regarding failure to provide covered services or efforts to obtain payment, other than authorized copayments, for covered services directly from enrollees, but nothing in this chapter empowers the director to impose any sanctions under Title 18 RCW or any other professional or facility licensing statute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A managed health care system shall pay a nonparticipating provider that provides a service covered under this chapter to the system's enrollee no more than the lowest amount paid for that service under the managed health care system's contracts with similar providers in the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pursuant to federal managed care access standards, 42 C.F.R. Sec. 438, managed health care systems must maintain a network of appropriate providers that is supported by written agreements sufficient to provide adequate access to all services covered under the contract with the authority, including hospital-based physician services. The authority will monitor and periodically report on the proportion of services provided by contracted providers and nonparticipating providers, by county, for each managed health care system to ensure that managed health care systems are meeting network adequacy requirements. No later than January 1st of each year, the authority will review and report its findings to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the legislature for the preceding state fiscal year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The plan shall allow, at least annually, an opportunity for enrollees to transfer their enrollments among participating managed health care systems serving their respective areas. The director shall establish a period of at least twenty days in a given year when this opportunity is afforded enrollees, and in those areas served by more than one participating managed health care system the director shall endeavor to establish a uniform period for such opportunity. The plan shall allow enrollees to transfer their enrollment to another participating managed health care system at any time upon a showing of good cause for the transfer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to negotiating with any managed health care system, the director shall determine, on an actuarially sound basis, the reasonable cost of providing the schedule of basic health care services, expressed in terms of upper and lower limits, and recognizing variations in the cost of providing the services through the various systems and in different areas of the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In negotiating with managed health care systems for participation in the plan, the director shall adopt a uniform procedure that includes at least the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The director shall issue a request for proposals, including standards regarding the quality of services to be provided; financial integrity of the responding systems; and responsiveness to the unmet health care needs of the local communities or populations that may be served;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director shall then review responsive proposals and may negotiate with respondents to the extent necessary to refine any proposals;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director may then select one or more systems to provide the covered services within a local area; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director may adopt a policy that gives preference to respondents, such as nonprofit community health clinics, that have a history of providing quality health care services to low-income persons.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The director may contract with a managed health care system to provide covered basic health care services to subsidized enrollees, nonsubsidized enrollees, health coverage tax credit eligible enrollees, or any combination thereof. At a minimum, such contracts issued on or after January 1, 2012, must include:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Sufficient funding is available to support the design and development work necessary for the program to provide health coverage to enrollees beginning January 1, 2014;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anticipated federal funding under section 1331 will be sufficient, absent any additional state funding, to cover the provision of essential health benefits and costs for administering the basic health plan. Enrollee premium levels will be below the levels that would apply to persons with income between one hundred thirty-four and two hundred percent of the federal poverty level through the exchange; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health plan payment rates will be sufficient to ensure enrollee access to a robust provider network and health homes, as described under RCW 70.47.100.</p>
</li>

<p>If the legislature determines to proceed with implementation of a federal basic health option, the director shall provide the necessary certifications to the secretary of the federal department of health and human services under section 1331 of P.L. 111-148 of 2010, as amended, to proceed with adoption of the federal basic health program option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to making this finding, the director shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Actively consult with the board of the Washington health benefit exchange, the office of the insurance commissioner, consumer advocates, provider organizations, carriers, and other interested organizations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider any available objective analysis specific to Washington state, by an independent nationally recognized consultant that has been actively engaged in analysis and economic modeling of the federal basic health program option for multiple states.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director shall report any findings and supporting analysis made under this section to the governor and relevant policy and fiscal committees of the legislature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the extent funding is available specifically for this purpose in the operating budget, the health care authority shall assume the federal basic health plan option will be implemented in Washington state, and initiate the necessary design and development work. If the legislature determines under subsection (1) of this section not to proceed with implementation, the authority may cease activities related to basic health program implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If implemented, the federal basic health program must be guided by the following principles:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Meeting the minimum state certification standards in section 1331 of the federal patient protection and affordable care act;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the extent allowed by the federal department of health and human services, twelve-month continuous eligibility for the basic health program, and corresponding twelve-month continuous enrollment in standard health plans by enrollees; or, in lieu of twelve-month continuous eligibility, financing mechanisms that enable enrollees to remain with a plan for the entire plan year;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Achieving an appropriate balance between:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Premiums and cost-sharing minimized to increase the affordability of insurance coverage;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standard health plan contracting requirements that minimize plan and provider administrative costs, while incentivizing improvements in quality and enrollee health outcomes; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health plan payment rates and provider payment rates that are sufficient to ensure enrollee access to a robust provider network and health homes, as described under RCW 70.47.100; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
