<p>The legislature finds that a health care access problem exists in rural areas of the state because rural health care providers are unable to leave the community for short-term periods of time to attend required continuing education training or for personal matters because their absence would leave the community without adequate medical care coverage. The lack of adequate medical coverage in geographically remote rural communities constitutes a threat to the health and safety of the people in those communities.</p>
<p>The legislature declares that it is in the public interest to recruit and maintain a pool of physicians, physician assistants, pharmacists, and advanced registered nurse practitioners willing and able on short notice to practice in rural communities on a short-term basis to meet the medical needs of the community.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that a shortage of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and physician assistants exists in rural areas of the state. In addition, many education programs to train these health care providers do not include options for practical training experience in rural settings. As a result, many health care providers find their current training does not prepare them for the unique demands of rural practice.</p>
<p>The legislature declares that the availability of rural training opportunities as a part of professional medical, nursing, pharmacist, and physician assistant education would provide needed practical experience, serve to attract providers to rural areas, and help address the current shortage of these providers in rural Washington.</p>

<p>The department shall establish or contract for a health professional temporary substitute resource pool. The purpose of the pool is to provide short-term physician, physician assistant, pharmacist, and advanced registered nurse practitioner personnel to rural communities where these health care providers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Are unavailable due to provider shortages;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Need time off from practice to attend continuing education and other training programs; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Need time off from practice to attend to personal matters or recover from illness.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The health professional temporary substitute resource pool is intended to provide short-term assistance and should complement active health provider recruitment efforts by rural communities where shortages exist.</p>

<p>The plan shall identify the most expeditious and cost-efficient manner to recruit and train midwives to meet the current shortages.
