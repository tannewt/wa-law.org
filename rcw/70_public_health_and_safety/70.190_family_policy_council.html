<p>The council shall annually solicit from community networks proposals to facilitate greater flexibility, coordination, and responsiveness of services at the community level. The council shall consider such proposals only if:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A comprehensive plan has been prepared by the community networks;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The community network has identified and agreed to contribute matching funds as specified in *RCW 70.190.010;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An interagency agreement has been prepared by the council and the participating local service and support agencies that governs the use of funds, specifies the relationship of the project to the principles listed in RCW 74.14A.025, and identifies specific outcomes and indicators; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The community network has designed into its comprehensive plan standards for accountability. Accountability standards include, but are not limited to, the public hearing process eliciting public comment about the appropriateness of the proposed comprehensive plan. The community network must submit reports to the council outlining the public response regarding the appropriateness and effectiveness of the comprehensive plan.</p>

<p>The Washington state institute for public policy shall conduct or contract for monitoring and tracking of the implementation of chapter 7, Laws of 1994 sp. sess. to determine whether these efforts result in a measurable reduction of violence. The institute shall also conduct or contract for an evaluation of the effectiveness of the community public health and safety networks in reducing the rate of at-risk youth through reducing risk factors and increasing protective factors. The evaluation plan shall result in statistically valid evaluation at both statewide and community levels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Starting five years after the initial grant to a community network, if the community network fails to meet the outcome standards and goals in any two consecutive years, the institute shall make recommendations to the legislature concerning whether the funds received by that community network should revert back to the originating agency. In making this determination, the institute shall consider the adequacy of the level of intervention relative to the risk factors in the community and any external events having a significant impact on risk factors or outcomes.</p>

<li>
<p>The outcomes required under this chapter and social development standards and measures established by the department of health under RCW 43.70.555 shall be used in conducting the outcome evaluation of the community networks.</p>

<li>
<p>The legislature authorizes community public health and safety networks to reconnect parents and other citizens with children, youth, families, and community institutions which support health and safety. The networks have only those powers and duties expressly authorized under this chapter. The networks should empower parents and other citizens by being a means of expressing their attitudes, spirit, and perspectives regarding safe and healthy family and community life. The legislature intends that parent and other citizen perspectives exercise a controlling influence over policy and program operations of professional organizations concerned with children and family issues within networks in a manner consistent with the Constitution and state law. It is not the intent of the legislature that health, social service, or educational professionals dominate community public health and safety network processes or programs, but rather that these professionals use their skills to lend support to parents and other citizens in expressing their values as parents and other citizens identify community needs and establish community priorities. To this end, the legislature intends full participation of parents and other citizens in community public health and safety networks. The intent is that local community values are reflected in the operations of the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A group of persons described in subsection (3) of this section may apply to be a community public health and safety network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each community public health and safety network shall be composed of twenty-three people, thirteen of whom shall be citizens who live within the network boundary with no fiduciary interest. In selecting these members, first priority shall be given to members of community mobilization advisory boards, city or county children's services commissions, human services advisory boards, or other such organizations. The thirteen persons shall be selected as follows: Three by chambers of commerce, three by school board members, three by county legislative authorities, three by city legislative authorities, and one high school student, selected by student organizations. The remaining ten members shall live or work within the network boundary and shall include local representation selected by the following groups and entities: Cities; counties; federally recognized Indian tribes; parks and recreation programs; law enforcement agencies; state children's service workers; employment assistance workers; private social service providers, broad-based nonsecular organizations, or health service providers; and public education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each of the twenty-three people who are members of each community public health and safety network must sign an annual declaration under penalty of perjury or a notarized statement that clearly, in plain and understandable language, states whether or not he or she has a fiduciary interest. If a member has a fiduciary interest, the nature of that interest must be made clear, in plain understandable language, on the signed statement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Members of the network shall serve terms of three years.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The terms of the initial members of each network shall be as follows: (a) One-third shall serve for one year; (b) one-third shall serve for two years; and (c) one-third shall serve for three years. Initial members may agree which shall serve fewer than three years or the decision may be made by lot. Any vacancy occurring during the term may be filled by the chair for the balance of the unexpired term.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<p>Not less than sixty days before the expiration of a network member's term, the chair shall submit the name of a nominee to the network for its approval. The network shall comply with subsection (3) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Networks are subject to the open public meetings act under chapter 42.30 RCW and the public records provisions of chapter 42.56 RCW.</p>
