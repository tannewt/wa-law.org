<p>a.  The actor reasonably believed that the prior spouse was dead; or</p>
<p>b.  A court had entered a judgment purporting to terminate or annul any prior disqualifying marriage and the actor did not know that such judgment was invalid; or</p>
<p>c.  The actor reasonably believed that he or she was legally eligible to marry.</p>
