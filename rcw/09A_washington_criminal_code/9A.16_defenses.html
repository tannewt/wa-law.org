<li>
<p>Homicide or the use of deadly force is justifiable in the following cases:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>When a public officer applies deadly force in obedience to the judgment of a competent court; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When necessarily used by a peace officer meeting the good faith standard of this section to overcome actual resistance to the execution of the legal process, mandate, or order of a court or officer, or in the discharge of a legal duty; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When necessarily used by a peace officer meeting the good faith standard of this section or person acting under the officer's command and in the officer's aid:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>To arrest or apprehend a person who the officer reasonably believes has committed, has attempted to commit, is committing, or is attempting to commit a felony;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To prevent the escape of a person from a federal or state correctional facility or in retaking a person who escapes from such a facility;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To prevent the escape of a person from a county or city jail or holding facility if the person has been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of a felony; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To lawfully suppress a riot if the actor or another participant is armed with a deadly weapon.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In considering whether to use deadly force under subsection (1)(c) of this section, to arrest or apprehend any person for the commission of any crime, the peace officer must have probable cause to believe that the suspect, if not apprehended, poses a threat of serious physical harm to the officer or a threat of serious physical harm to others. Among the circumstances which may be considered by peace officers as a &quot;threat of serious physical harm&quot; are the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The suspect threatens a peace officer with a weapon or displays a weapon in a manner that could reasonably be construed as threatening; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is probable cause to believe that the suspect has committed any crime involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious physical harm.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Under these circumstances deadly force may also be used if necessary to prevent escape from the officer, where, if feasible, some warning is given, provided the officer meets the good faith standard of this section.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>A public officer covered by subsection (1)(a) of this section shall not be held criminally liable for using deadly force without malice and with a good faith belief that such act is justifiable pursuant to this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A peace officer shall not be held criminally liable for using deadly force in good faith, where &quot;good faith&quot; is an objective standard which shall consider all the facts, circumstances, and information known to the officer at the time to determine whether a similarly situated reasonable officer would have believed that the use of deadly force was necessary to prevent death or serious physical harm to the officer or another individual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section shall not be construed as:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Affecting the permissible use of force by a person acting under the authority of RCW 9A.16.020 or 9A.16.050; or</p>

<p>Preventing a law enforcement agency from adopting standards pertaining to its use of deadly force that are more restrictive than this section.</p>

<li>
<p>No person in the state shall be placed in legal jeopardy of any kind whatsoever for protecting by any reasonable means necessary, himself or herself, his or her family, or his or her real or personal property, or for coming to the aid of another who is in imminent danger of or the victim of assault, robbery, kidnapping, arson, burglary, rape, murder, or any other violent crime as defined in RCW 9.94A.030.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a person charged with a crime listed in subsection (1) of this section is found not guilty by reason of self-defense, the state of Washington shall reimburse the defendant for all reasonable costs, including loss of time, legal fees incurred, and other expenses involved in his or her defense. This reimbursement is not an independent cause of action. To award these reasonable costs the trier of fact must find that the defendant's claim of self-defense was sustained by a preponderance of the evidence. If the trier of fact makes a determination of self-defense, the judge shall determine the amount of the award.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding a finding that a defendant's actions were justified by self-defense, if the trier of fact also determines that the defendant was engaged in criminal conduct substantially related to the events giving rise to the charges filed against the defendant the judge may deny or reduce the amount of the award. In determining the amount of the award, the judge shall also consider the seriousness of the initial criminal conduct.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Nothing in this section precludes the legislature from using the sundry claims process to grant an award where none was granted under this section or to grant a higher award than one granted under this section.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>Whenever the issue of self-defense under this section is decided by a judge, the judge shall consider the same questions as must be answered in the special verdict under subsection (4) [(5)] of this section.</p>

<p>Whenever the issue of self-defense under this section has been submitted to a jury, and the jury has found the defendant not guilty, the court shall instruct the jury to return a special verdict in substantially the following form:</p>
