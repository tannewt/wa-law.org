<p>The legislature finds and declares that the public policy of this state favors the marketability of real property and the transferability of interests in real property free of title defects or unreasonable restraints on alienation. The legislature further finds and declares that private transfer fee obligations violate this public policy by impairing the marketability and transferability of real property and by constituting an unreasonable restraint on alienation regardless of the duration of the obligation to pay a private transfer fee, the amount of a private transfer fee, or the method by which any private transfer fee is created or imposed. Thus, the legislature finds and declares that a private transfer fee obligation may not run with the title to real property, touch or concern the real property, or otherwise bind subsequent owners of real property under any common law or equitable principle.</p>

<p>A private transfer fee obligation recorded or entered into in this state on or after April 13, 2011, does not run with the title to real property and is not binding on or enforceable at law or in equity against any subsequent owner, purchaser, or mortgagee or holder of any interest in real property as an equitable servitude or otherwise. Any private transfer fee obligation that is recorded or entered into in this state on or after April 13, 2011, is void and unenforceable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A private transfer fee obligation recorded or entered into in this state before April 13, 2011, is not presumed valid and enforceable. Any such private transfer fee obligation must be interpreted and enforced according to principles of applicable real estate, servitude contract, and other law including, without limitation, restraints on alienation, the rule against perpetuities, the touch and concern doctrine, and the requirement for covenants to run with the land, as well as fraud, misrepresentation, violation of public policy, or another invalidating cause.</p>

<p>Any person who records, or enters into, an agreement imposing a private transfer fee obligation in the person's favor after April 13, 2011, is liable for (1) any damages resulting from the imposition of the private transfer fee obligation on the transfer of an interest in the real property including, but not limited to, the amount of any private transfer fee paid by a party to the transfer, and (2) reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses, and costs incurred by a party to the transfer or mortgagee of the real property to recover any private transfer fee paid or in connection with an action to quiet title. If an agent acts on behalf of a principal to record or secure a private transfer fee obligation, liability must be assessed to the principal, rather than the agent.</p>
