<p>The legislature finds and declares that the distribution and sale of motor vehicles in this state vitally affect the general economy of the state and the public interest and public welfare, that provision for warranty service to motor vehicles is of substantial concern to the people of this state, that the maintenance of fair competition among dealers and others is in the public interest, and that the maintenance of strong and sound dealerships is essential to provide continuing and necessary reliable services to the consuming public in this state and to provide stable employment to the citizens of this state. The legislature further finds that there is a substantial disparity in bargaining power between automobile manufacturers and their dealers, and that in order to promote the public interest and the public welfare, and in the exercise of its police power, it is necessary to regulate the relationship between motor vehicle dealers and motor vehicle manufacturers, importers, distributors, and their representatives doing business in this state, not only for the protection of dealers but also for the benefit for the public in assuring the continued availability and servicing of automobiles sold to the public.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes it is in the best interest for manufacturers and dealers of motor vehicles to conduct business with each other in a fair, efficient, and competitive manner. The legislature declares the public interest is best served by dealers being assured of the ability to manage their business enterprises under a contractual obligation with manufacturers where dealers do not experience unreasonable interference and are assured of the ability to transfer ownership of their business without undue constraints. It is the intent of the legislature to impose a regulatory scheme and to regulate competition in the motor vehicle industry to the extent necessary to balance fairness and efficiency. These actions will permit motor vehicle dealers to better serve consumers and allow dealers to devote their best competitive efforts and resources to the sale and services of the manufacturer's products to consumers.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the terms of a franchise and notwithstanding the terms of a waiver, no manufacturer may terminate, cancel, or fail to renew a franchise with a new motor vehicle dealer, unless the manufacturer has complied with the notice requirements of RCW 46.96.070 and an administrative law judge has determined, if requested in writing by the new motor vehicle dealer within the applicable time period specified in RCW 46.96.070 (1), (2), or (3), after hearing, that there is good cause for the termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal of the franchise and that the manufacturer has acted in good faith, as defined in this chapter, regarding the termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal. Between the time of issuance of the notice required under RCW 46.96.070 and the effective termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal of the franchise under this chapter, the rights, duties, and obligations of the new motor vehicle dealer and the manufacturer under the franchise and this chapter are unaffected, including those under RCW 46.96.200.</p>

<p>A new motor vehicle dealer who has received written notification from the manufacturer of the manufacturer's intent to terminate, cancel, or not renew the franchise may file a petition with the department for a determination as to the existence of good cause and good faith for the termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal of a franchise. The petition shall contain a short statement setting forth the reasons for the dealer's objection to the termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal of the franchise. Upon the filing of the petition and the receipt of the filing fee, the department shall promptly notify the manufacturer that a timely petition has been filed and shall request the appointment of an administrative law judge under chapter 34.12 RCW to conduct a hearing. The franchise in question shall continue in full force and effect pending the administrative law judge's decision. If the decision of the administrative law judge terminating, canceling, or failing to renew a dealer's franchise is appealed by a dealer, the franchise in question shall continue in full force and effect until the appeal to superior court is finally determined or until the expiration of one hundred eighty days from the date of issuance of the administrative law judge's written decision, whichever is less.

<li>Notwithstanding the terms of a franchise or the terms of a waiver, and except as otherwise provided in RCW 46.96.070(2) (a) through (d), good cause exists for termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal when there is a failure by the new motor vehicle dealer to comply with a provision of the franchise that is both reasonable and of material significance to the franchise relationship, if the new motor vehicle dealer was notified of the failure within one hundred eighty days after the manufacturer first acquired knowledge of the failure and the new motor vehicle dealer did not correct the failure after being requested to do so.</li>
</ol>
<p>If, however, the failure of the new motor vehicle dealer relates to the performance of the new motor vehicle dealer in sales, service, or level of customer satisfaction, good cause is the failure of the new motor vehicle dealer to comply with reasonable performance standards determined by the manufacturer in accordance with uniformly applied criteria, and:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The new motor vehicle dealer was advised, in writing, by the manufacturer of the failure;</p>

<p>The manufacturer provided the new motor vehicle dealer with specific, reasonable goals or reasonable performance standards with which the dealer must comply, together with a suggested timetable or program for attaining those goals or standards, and the new motor vehicle dealer was given a reasonable opportunity, for a period not less than one hundred eighty days, to comply with the goals or standards; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new motor vehicle dealer did not substantially comply with the manufacturer's performance standards during that period and the failure to demonstrate substantial compliance was not due to market or economic factors within the new motor vehicle dealer's relevant market area that were beyond the control of the dealer.</p>

<p>The manufacturer or distributor allocated sufficient inventory in the new motor vehicle dealer's primary allocation, both in quantity and product mix, for the dealers' assigned market area.

</li>
<li>
<p>The manufacturer provides to the new motor vehicle dealer, upon the dealers' request, documentation sufficient to develop a market analysis. This documentation must include, but is not limited to, the allocation of inventory to the dealer and other dealers in the same zone during the period established by the manufacturer, and must not be shared by the dealer with any party not involved in preparing a market analysis or otherwise engaged in the termination proceeding.</p>

For the purposes of this chapter, the discontinuance of the sale and distribution of a new motor vehicle line, or the constructive discontinuance by material reduction in selection offered, such that continuing to retail the line is no longer economically viable for a dealer is, at the option of the dealer, considered a termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal of a franchise. The notice shall be by certified mail or personally delivered to the new motor vehicle dealer and shall state the intention to terminate, cancel, or not renew the franchise, the reasons for the termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal, and the effective date of the termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal.

<li>
<p>A manufacturer shall compensate its new motor vehicle dealers for all labor and parts required by the manufacturer to perform recall repairs at rates no lower than those set in accordance with RCW 46.96.105. If parts or a remedy are not reasonably available to perform a recall service or repair on a used vehicle held for sale by a dealer authorized to sell new vehicles of the same line make within fifteen days of the manufacturer issuing the initial notice of recall, and the manufacturer has issued a stop-sale, do-not-drive order, or the manufacturer has not certified that the issue identified in the notice of recall does not affect the safe operation of the vehicle, commencing on the fifteenth day after the notice or order was issued and ending on the earlier of the date that the remedy or repair parts necessary to resolve the recall, stop-sale, or do-not-drive order are available to the dealer for vehicles in the dealer's inventory or the dealer sells, trades, or otherwise disposes of the vehicle, the manufacturer shall compensate the dealer at a prorated rate of at least 1.75 percent of the average trade-in value as indicated in an independent third-party guide for the year, make, model, and mileage of the recalled vehicle, per month, or portion of a month, while the recall or remedy parts are unavailable and the order remains in effect. A manufacturer is not required to compensate a motor vehicle dealer for more than the total trade-in value of the vehicle as established under this section. A manufacturer is not required to compensate a motor vehicle dealer for vehicles purchased by the dealer at a wholesale auction after the date the order was issued. A stop-sale or do-not-drive order is defined as a notification issued by a vehicle manufacturer to its franchised dealers stating that certain used vehicles in inventory should not be sold or leased, at retail or wholesale, due to a federal safety recall for a defect or a noncompliance, or a federal or California emissions recall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section applies only to used vehicles subject to safety or emissions recalls pursuant to and recalled in accordance with federal law and regulations adopted thereunder and where a stop-sale, do-not-drive order has been issued, or the manufacturer has not certified that the issue identified in the notice of recall does not affect the safe operation of the vehicle. This section further applies only to new motor vehicle dealers holding used vehicles for sale that are a line make that the dealer is franchised to sell or on which the dealer is authorized to perform recall repairs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All reimbursement claims made by new motor vehicle dealers pursuant to this section for recall remedies or repairs, or for compensation where no part or repair is reasonably available and the vehicle is subject to a stop-sale, do-not-drive, or the manufacturer has not certified that the issue identified in the notice of recall does not affect the safe operation of the vehicle, is subject to the same limitations and requirements as a warranty reimbursement claim made under RCW 46.96.105. Claims shall be either approved or disapproved within thirty days after they are submitted to the manufacturer in the manner and on the forms the manufacturer reasonably prescribes. A manufacturer shall pay a claim within thirty days following approval. Any claim not specifically disapproved in writing within thirty days following receipt is approved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A manufacturer may compensate its franchised dealers under a national recall compensation program provided the compensation under the program is equal to or greater than that provided in subsection (1) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A manufacturer may not otherwise recover all or any portion of its costs for compensating its dealers licensed in this state for recalled vehicles, parts, and service either by reduction in the amount due to the dealer or by separate charge, surcharge, or other imposition.</p>

<li>
<p>Each manufacturer shall specify in its franchise agreement, or in a separate written agreement, with each of its dealers licensed in this state, the dealer's obligation to perform warranty work or service on the manufacturer's products. Each manufacturer shall provide each of its dealers with a schedule of compensation to be paid to the dealer for any warranty work or service, including parts, labor, and diagnostic work, required of the dealer by the manufacturer in connection with the manufacturer's products. The schedule of compensation must not be less than the rates charged by the dealer for similar service to retail customers for nonwarranty service and repairs, and must not be less than the schedule of compensation for an existing dealer as of June 10, 2010.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The rates charged by the dealer for nonwarranty service or work for parts means the price paid by the dealer for those parts, including all shipping and other charges, increased by the franchisee's average percentage markup. A dealer must establish and declare the dealer's average percentage markup by submitting to the manufacturer one hundred sequential customer-paid service repair orders or ninety days of customer-paid service repair orders, whichever is less, covering repairs made no more than one hundred eighty days before the submission. A change in a dealer's established average percentage markup takes effect thirty days following the submission. A manufacturer may not require a dealer to establish average percentage markup by another methodology. A manufacturer may not require information that the dealer believes is unduly burdensome or time-consuming to provide, including, but not limited to, part-by-part or transaction-by-transaction calculations. In calculating the retail rate customarily charged by the dealer for parts and labor, the following work must not be included in the calculation:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Repairs for manufacturer or distributor special events, specials, or promotional discounts for retail customer repairs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parts sold at wholesale or at reduced or specially negotiated rates for insurance repairs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Routine maintenance not covered under warranty, such as fluids, filters, and belts not provided in the course of repairs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nuts, bolts, fasteners, and similar items that do not have an individual part number;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tires;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Batteries and light bulbs; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vehicle reconditioning.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A manufacturer shall compensate a dealer for labor and diagnostic work at the rates charged by the dealer to its retail customers for such work and for any documentation work required by the manufacturer to authorize or verify the work including, but not limited to, photographs, paperwork, and electronic data entry. However, a manufacturer is not required to compensate a dealer more than once for the same documentation work. If a manufacturer can demonstrate that the rates unreasonably exceed those of all other franchised motor vehicle dealers in the same relevant market area offering the same or a competitive motor vehicle line, the manufacturer is not required to honor the rate increase proposed by the dealer. If the manufacturer is not required to honor the rate increase proposed by the dealer, the dealer is entitled to resubmit a new proposed rate for labor and diagnostic work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A dealer may not be granted an increase in the average percentage markup or labor and diagnostic work rate more than once in one calendar year.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>All claims for warranty work for parts and labor made by dealers under this section must be submitted to the manufacturer within ninety days of the date the work was performed. All claims submitted must be paid by the manufacturer within thirty days following receipt, provided the claim has been approved by the manufacturer. The manufacturer has the right to audit claims for warranty work and to charge the dealer for any unsubstantiated, incorrect, or false claims for a period of nine months following payment. However, the manufacturer may audit and charge the dealer for any fraudulent claims during any period for which an action for fraud may be commenced under applicable state law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All claims submitted by dealers on the forms and in the manner specified by the manufacturer shall be either approved or disapproved within thirty days following their receipt. The manufacturer shall notify the dealer in writing of any disapproved claim, and shall set forth the reasons why the claim was not approved. Any claim not specifically disapproved in writing within thirty days following receipt is approved, and the manufacturer is required to pay that claim within thirty days of receipt of the claim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A manufacturer may not otherwise recover all or any portion of its costs for compensating its dealers licensed in this state for warranty parts and service either by reduction in the amount due to the dealer or by separate charge, surcharge, or other imposition.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The manufacturer may request, and the designated successor shall promptly provide, such personal and financial information as is reasonably necessary to determine whether the succession should be honored.</p>

<p>A manufacturer may refuse to honor the succession to the ownership of a new motor vehicle dealer franchise by a designated successor if the manufacturer establishes that good cause exists for its refusal to honor the succession. If the designated successor of a new motor vehicle dealer franchise fails to meet the requirements set forth in subsections (2)(a), (b), and (c) of this section, good cause for refusing to honor the succession is presumed to exist. If a manufacturer believes that good cause exists for refusing to honor the succession to the ownership of a new motor vehicle dealer franchise by a designated successor, the manufacturer shall serve written notice on the designated successor and on the department of its refusal to honor the succession no earlier than sixty days from the date the notice is served. The notice must be served not later than sixty days after the manufacturer's receipt of:</p>

The petition shall contain a short statement setting forth the reasons for the designated successor's protest. Upon the filing of a protest and the receipt of the filing fee, the department shall promptly notify the manufacturer that a timely protest has been filed and shall request the appointment of an administrative law judge under chapter 34.12 RCW to conduct a hearing. The manufacturer shall not terminate or otherwise discontinue the existing franchise until the administrative law judge has held a hearing and has determined that there is good cause for refusing to honor the succession. If an appeal is taken, the manufacturer shall not terminate or discontinue the franchise until the appeal to superior court is finally determined or until the expiration of one hundred eighty days from the date of issuance of the administrative law judge's written decision, whichever is less. Nothing in this section precludes a manufacturer or dealer from petitioning the superior court for a stay or other relief pending judicial review.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Within thirty days after receipt of the notice under RCW 46.96.140, or within thirty days after the end of an appeal procedure provided by the manufacturer, whichever is greater, a new motor vehicle dealer so notified or entitled to notice may file a petition with the department protesting the proposed establishment or relocation. The petition shall contain a short statement setting forth the reasons for the dealer's objection to the proposed establishment or relocation. Upon the filing of a protest and the receipt of the filing fee, the department shall promptly notify the manufacturer that a timely protest has been filed and shall request the appointment of an administrative law judge under chapter 34.12 RCW to conduct a hearing. The manufacturer shall not establish or relocate the new motor vehicle dealer until the administrative law judge has held a hearing and has determined that there is good cause for permitting the proposed establishment or relocation. When more than one protest is filed against the establishment or relocation of the same dealer, the administrative law judge shall consolidate the hearings to expedite disposition of the matter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a manufacturer provides in the franchise agreement or by written statement distributed and provided to its dealers for arbitration under the Uniform Arbitration Act, chapter 7.04A RCW, as a mechanism for resolving disputes relating to the establishment of an additional new motor vehicle dealer or the relocation of a new motor vehicle dealer, then the provisions of this section and RCW 46.96.170 relating to hearings by an administrative law judge do not apply, and a dispute regarding the establishment of an additional new motor vehicle dealer or the relocation of an existing new motor vehicle dealer shall be determined in an arbitration proceeding conducted in accordance with the Uniform Arbitration Act, chapter 7.04A RCW. The thirty-day period for filing a protest under this section still applies except that the protesting dealer shall file his or her protest with the manufacturer within thirty days after receipt of the notice under RCW 46.96.140.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dispute shall be referred for arbitration to such arbitrator as may be agreed upon by the parties to the dispute. If the parties cannot agree upon a single arbitrator within thirty days from the date the protest is filed, the protesting dealer will select an arbitrator, the manufacturer will select an arbitrator, and the two arbitrators will then select a third. If a third arbitrator is not agreed upon within thirty days, any party may apply to the superior court, and the judge of the superior court having jurisdiction will appoint the third arbitrator. The protesting dealer will pay the arbitrator selected by him or her, and the manufacturer will pay the arbitrator it selected. The expense of the third arbitrator and all other expenses of arbitration will be shared equally by the parties. Attorneys' fees and fees paid to expert witnesses are not expenses of arbitration and will be paid by the person incurring them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding the terms of a franchise or written statement of the manufacturer and notwithstanding the terms of a waiver, the arbitration will take place in the state of Washington in the county where the protesting dealer has his or her principal place of business. RCW 46.96.160 applies to a determination made by the arbitrator or arbitrators in determining whether good cause exists for permitting the proposed establishment or relocation of a new motor vehicle dealer, and the manufacturer has the burden of proof to establish that good cause exists for permitting the proposed establishment or relocation. After a hearing has been held, the arbitrator or arbitrators shall render a decision as expeditiously as possible, but in any event not later than one hundred twenty days from the date the arbitrator or arbitrators are selected or appointed. The manufacturer shall not establish or relocate the new motor vehicle dealer until the arbitration hearing has been held and the arbitrator or arbitrators have determined that there is good cause for permitting the proposed establishment or relocation. The written decision of the arbitrator is binding upon the parties unless modified, corrected, or vacated under the Washington Arbitration Act. Any party may appeal the decision of the arbitrator under the Uniform Arbitration Act, chapter 7.04A RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the franchise agreement or the manufacturer's written statement distributed and provided to its dealers does not provide for arbitration under the Uniform Arbitration Act as a mechanism for resolving disputes relating to the establishment of an additional new motor vehicle dealer or the relocation of a new motor vehicle dealer, then the hearing provisions of this section and RCW 46.96.170 apply. Nothing in this section is intended to preclude a new motor vehicle dealer from electing to use any other dispute resolution mechanism offered by a manufacturer.</p>

<p>In determining whether good cause exists for permitting the proposed establishment or relocation of a new motor vehicle dealer of the same line make, the administrative law judge shall take into consideration the existing circumstances, including, but not limited to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The extent, nature, and permanency of the investment of both the existing motor vehicle dealers of the same line make in the relevant market area and the proposed additional or relocating new motor vehicle dealer, including obligations reasonably incurred by the existing dealers to perform their obligations under their respective franchises;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The growth or decline in population and new motor vehicle registrations during the past five years in the relevant market area;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The effect on the consuming public in the relevant market area;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The effect on the existing new motor vehicle dealers in the relevant market area, including any adverse financial impact;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reasonably expected or anticipated vehicle market for the relevant market area, including demographic factors such as age of population, income, education, size class preference, product popularity, retail lease transactions, or other factors affecting sales to consumers in the relevant market area;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether it is injurious or beneficial to the public welfare for an additional new motor vehicle dealer to be established;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the new motor vehicle dealers of the same line make in the relevant market area are providing adequate competition and convenient customer care for the motor vehicles of the same line make in the relevant market area, including the adequacy of motor vehicle sales and service facilities, equipment, supply of vehicle parts, and qualified service personnel;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the establishment of an additional new motor vehicle dealer would increase competition and be in the public interest;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the manufacturer is motivated principally by good faith to establish an additional or new motor vehicle dealer and not by noneconomic considerations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the manufacturer has denied its existing new motor vehicle dealers of the same line make the opportunity for reasonable growth, market expansion, establishment of a subagency, or relocation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the protesting dealer or dealers are in substantial compliance with their dealer agreements or franchises; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the manufacturer has complied with the requirements of RCW 46.96.140 and 46.96.150.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In considering the factors set forth in this section, the administrative law judge shall give the factors equal weight, and in making a determination as to whether good cause exists for permitting the proposed establishment or relocation of a new motor vehicle dealer of the same line make, the administrative law judge must find that at least nine of the factors set forth in this section weigh in favor of the manufacturer and in favor of the proposed establishment or relocation of a new motor vehicle dealer.</p>

<li>
<p>Compete with a new motor vehicle dealer of any make or line by acting in the capacity of a new motor vehicle dealer, or by owning, operating, or controlling, whether directly or indirectly, a motor vehicle dealership in this state. It is not, however, a violation of this subsection for:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>A manufacturer, distributor, factory branch, or factory representative to own or operate a dealership for a temporary period, not to exceed two years, during the transition from one owner of the dealership to another where the dealership was previously owned by a franchised dealer and is currently for sale to any qualified independent person at a fair and reasonable price. The temporary operation may be extended for one twelve-month period on petition of the temporary operator to the department. The matter will be handled as an adjudicative proceeding under chapter 34.05 RCW. A dealer who is a franchisee of the petitioning manufacturer or distributor may intervene and participate in a proceeding under this subsection (1)(g)(i).

Nothing in this subsection (1)(g)(ii) relieves a manufacturer, distributor, factory branch, or factory representative from complying with (a) through (f) of this subsection;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A manufacturer, distributor, factory branch, or factory representative to own or operate a dealership in conjunction with an independent person in a bona fide business relationship where the independent person: (A) Has made, or within a period of two years from the date of commencement of operation will have made, a significant, bona fide capital investment in the dealership that is subject to loss; (B) has an ownership interest in the dealership; and (C) operates the dealership under a bona fide written agreement with the manufacturer, distributor, factory branch, or factory representative under which he or she will acquire all of the ownership interest in the dealership within a reasonable period of time and under reasonable terms and conditions.

<li>
<p>Terminate, cancel, or fail to renew a franchise with a new motor vehicle dealer based upon any of the following events, which do not constitute good cause for termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal under RCW 46.96.060: (A) The fact that the new motor vehicle dealer owns, has an investment in, participates in the management of, or holds a franchise agreement for the sale or service of another make or line of new motor vehicles; (B) the fact that the new motor vehicle dealer has established another make or line of new motor vehicles or service in the same dealership facilities as those of the manufacturer or distributor; (C) that the new motor vehicle dealer has or intends to relocate the manufacturer or distributor's make or line of new motor vehicles or service to an existing dealership facility that is within the relevant market area, as defined in RCW 46.96.140, of the make or line to be relocated, except that, in any nonemergency circumstance, the dealer must give the manufacturer or distributor at least sixty days' notice of his or her intent to relocate and the relocation must comply with RCW 46.96.140 and 46.96.150 for any same make or line facility; or (D) the failure of a franchisee to change the location of the dealership or to make substantial alterations to the use or number of franchises on the dealership premises or facilities.</p>

<p>Coerce or attempt to coerce a motor vehicle dealer to refrain from, or prohibit or attempt to prohibit a new motor vehicle dealer from acquiring, owning, having an investment in, participating in the management of, or holding a franchise agreement for the sale or service of another make or line of new motor vehicles or related products, or establishing another make or line of new motor vehicles or service in the same dealership facilities, if the prohibition against acquiring, owning, investing, managing, or holding a franchise for such additional make or line of vehicles or products, or establishing another make or line of new motor vehicles or service in the same dealership facilities, is not supported by reasonable business considerations. The burden of proving that reasonable business considerations support or justify the prohibition against the additional make or line of new motor vehicles or products or nonexclusive facilities is on the manufacturer;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Require, by contract or otherwise, a new motor vehicle dealer to make a material alteration, expansion, or addition to any dealership facility, unless the required alteration, expansion, or addition is uniformly required of other similarly situated new motor vehicle dealers of the same make or line of vehicles and is reasonable in light of all existing circumstances, including economic conditions. In any proceeding in which a required facility alteration, expansion, or addition is an issue, the manufacturer or distributor has the burden of proof. Except for a program or any renewal or modification of a program that is in effect with one or more new motor vehicle dealers in this state on June 12, 2014, a manufacturer shall not require, coerce, or attempt to coerce any new motor vehicle dealer by program, policy, standard, or otherwise to change the location of the dealership or construct, replace, renovate, or make any substantial changes, alterations, or remodeling to a new motor vehicle dealer's sales or service facilities, except as necessary to comply with health or safety laws or to comply with technology requirements without which a dealer would be unable to service a vehicle the dealer has elected to sell, before the tenth anniversary of the date of issuance of the certificate of occupancy or the manufacturer's approval, whichever is later, from:</p>

<li>
<p>Prevent or attempt to prevent by contract or otherwise any new motor vehicle dealer from changing the executive management of a new motor vehicle dealer unless the manufacturer or distributor, having the burden of proof, can show that a proposed change of executive management will result in executive management by a person or persons who are not of good moral character or who do not meet reasonable, preexisting, and equitably applied standards of the manufacturer or distributor. If a manufacturer or distributor rejects a proposed change in the executive management, the manufacturer or distributor shall give written notice of its reasons to the dealer within sixty days after receiving written notice from the dealer of the proposed change and all related information reasonably requested by the manufacturer or distributor, or the change in executive management must be considered approved;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Take any adverse action against a new motor vehicle dealer including, but not limited to, charge backs or reducing vehicle allocations, for sales and service performance within a designated area of primary responsibility unless that area is reasonable in light of proximity to relevant census tracts to the dealership and competing dealerships, highways and road networks, any natural or man-made barriers, demographics, including economic factors, buyer behavior information, and contains only areas inside the state of Washington unless specifically approved by the new motor vehicle dealer;</p>

<li>
<p>Require, coerce, or attempt to coerce any new motor vehicle dealer by program, policy, facility guide, standard, or otherwise to order or accept delivery of any service or repair appliances, equipment, parts, or accessories, or any other commodity not required by law, which the dealer has not voluntarily ordered or which the dealer does not have the right to return unused for a full refund within ninety days or a longer period as mutually agreed upon by the dealer and manufacturer; or</p>

<li>
<p>Modify the franchise agreement for any new motor vehicle dealer unless the manufacturer notifies the dealer in writing of its intention to modify the agreement at least ninety days before the effective date thereof, stating the specific grounds for the modification, and undertakes the modification in good faith, for good cause, and in a manner that would not adversely and substantially alter the rights, obligations, investment, or return on investment of the franchised new motor vehicle dealer under the existing agreement.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the terms of a franchise, a manufacturer shall not withhold consent to the sale, transfer, or exchange of a franchise to a qualified buyer who meets the normal, reasonable, and uniformly applied standards established by the manufacturer for the appointment of a new dealer who does not already hold a franchise with the manufacturer or is capable of being licensed as a new motor vehicle dealer in the state of Washington. A decision or determination made by the administrative law judge as to whether a qualified buyer is capable of being licensed as a new motor vehicle dealer in the state of Washington is not conclusive or determinative of any ultimate determination made by the department of licensing as to the buyer's qualification for a motor vehicle dealer license. A manufacturer's failure to respond in writing to a request for consent under this subsection within sixty days after receipt of a written request on the forms, if any, generally used by the manufacturer containing the information and reasonable promises required by a manufacturer is deemed to be consent to the request. A manufacturer may request, and, if so requested, the applicant for a franchise (a) shall promptly provide such personal and financial information as is reasonably necessary to determine whether the sale, transfer, or exchange should be approved, and (b) shall agree to be bound by all reasonable terms and conditions of the franchise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a manufacturer refuses to approve the sale, transfer, or exchange of a franchise, the manufacturer shall serve written notice on the applicant, the transferring, selling, or exchanging new motor vehicle dealer, and the department of its refusal to approve the transfer of the franchise no later than sixty days after the date the manufacturer receives the written request from the new motor vehicle dealer. If the manufacturer has requested personal or financial information from the applicant under subsection (1) of this section, the notice shall be served not later than sixty days after the receipt of all of such documents. Service of all notices under this section shall be made by personal service or by certified mail, return receipt requested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The notice in subsection (2) of this section shall state the specific grounds for the refusal to approve the sale, transfer, or exchange of the franchise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within twenty days after receipt of the notice of refusal to approve the sale, transfer, or exchange of the franchise by the transferring new motor vehicle dealer, the new motor vehicle dealer may file a petition with the department to protest the refusal to approve the sale, transfer, or exchange. The petition shall contain a short statement setting forth the reasons for the dealer's protest. Upon the filing of a protest and the receipt of the filing fee, the department shall promptly notify the manufacturer that a timely protest has been filed, and the department shall arrange for a hearing with an administrative law judge as the presiding officer to determine if the manufacturer unreasonably withheld consent to the sale, transfer, or exchange of the franchise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The administrative law judge shall conduct a hearing and render a final decision as expeditiously as possible, but in any event not later than one hundred twenty days after a protest is filed. Only the selling, transferring, or exchanging new motor vehicle dealer and the manufacturer may be parties to the hearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The administrative law judge shall conduct any hearing as provided in RCW 46.96.050(2), and all hearing costs shall be borne as provided in that subsection. Only the manufacturer and the selling, transferring, or exchanging new motor vehicle dealer may appeal the final order of the administrative law judge as provided in RCW 46.96.050(3).</p>

In addition, the manufacturer or distributor shall pay any fees and expenses of the motor vehicle dealer arising on and after the date the manufacturer or distributor gives notice of the exercise of its right of first refusal, and incurred by the motor vehicle dealer as a result of alterations to documents, or additional appraisals, valuations, or financial analyses caused or required of the dealer by the manufacturer or distributor to consummate the contract for the sale of the dealership to the manufacturer's or distributor's proposed transferee, that would not have been incurred but for the manufacturer's or distributor's exercise of its right of first refusal. These expenses and fees must be paid by the manufacturer or distributor to the dealer and to the dealer's proposed purchaser or transferee on or before the closing date of the sale of the dealership to the manufacturer or distributor if the party entitled to reimbursement has submitted or caused to be submitted to the manufacturer or distributor, an accounting of these expenses and fees within thirty days after receipt of the manufacturer's or distributor's written request for the accounting.
