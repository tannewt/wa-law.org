<p>The provisions of this chapter, requiring deposit of security and suspensions for failure to deposit security, subject to certain exemptions, shall apply to the driver and owner of any vehicle of a type subject to registration under the motor vehicle laws of this state which is in any manner involved in an accident within this state, which accident has resulted in bodily injury or death of any person or damage to the property of any one person to an apparent extent equal to or greater than the minimum amount established by rule adopted by the director. The director shall adopt rules establishing the property damage threshold at which the provisions of this chapter apply with respect to the deposit of security and suspensions for failure to deposit security. Beginning October 1, 1987, the property damage threshold shall be five hundred dollars. The thresholds shall be revised when necessary, but not more frequently than every two years. The revisions shall only be for the purpose of recognizing economic changes as reflected by an inflationary index recommended by the office of financial management. The revisions shall be guided by the change in the index for the time period since the last revision and by the threshold established by the chief of the Washington state patrol for the filing of accident reports as provided in RCW 46.52.030.</p>

<li>
<p>Certification. A &quot;motor vehicle liability policy&quot; as said term is used in this chapter means an &quot;owner's policy&quot; or an &quot;operator's policy&quot; of liability insurance, certified as provided in RCW 46.29.460 or 46.29.470 as proof of financial responsibility for the future, and issued, except as otherwise provided in RCW 46.29.470, by an insurance carrier duly authorized to transact business in this state, to or for the benefit of the person named in the policy as insured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Owner's policy. Such owner's policy of liability insurance:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Shall designate by explicit description or by appropriate reference all vehicles with respect to which coverage is to be granted by the policy; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shall insure the person named therein and any other person, as insured, using any such vehicle or vehicles with the express or implied permission of such named insured, against loss from the liability imposed by law for damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of such vehicle or vehicles within the United States of America or the Dominion of Canada, subject to limits exclusive of interest and costs, with respect to each such vehicle as follows: Twenty-five thousand dollars because of bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident and, subject to said limit for one person, fifty thousand dollars because of bodily injury to or death of two or more persons in any one accident, and ten thousand dollars because of injury to or destruction of property of others in any one accident.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operator's policy. Such operator's policy of liability insurance shall insure the person named as insured therein against loss from the liability imposed upon him or her by law for damages arising out of the use by him or her of any motor vehicle not owned by him or her, within the same territorial limits and subject to the same limits of liability as are set forth above with respect to an owner's policy of liability insurance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Required statements in policies. Such motor vehicle liability policy shall state the name and address of the named insured, the coverage afforded by the policy, the premium charged therefor, the policy period, and the limits of liability, and shall contain an agreement or be endorsed that insurance is provided under the policy in accordance with the coverage defined in this chapter as respects bodily injury and death or property damage, or both, and is subject to all the provisions of this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policy need not insure workers' compensation, etc. Such motor vehicle liability policy need not insure any liability under any workers' compensation law nor any liability on account of bodily injury or death of an employee of the insured while engaged in the employment, other than domestic, of the insured, or while engaged in the operation, maintenance, or repair of any such vehicle nor any liability for damage to property owned by, rented to, in charge of, or transported by the insured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provisions incorporated in policy. Every motor vehicle liability policy is subject to the following provisions which need not be contained therein:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The liability of the insurance carrier with respect to the insurance required by this chapter becomes absolute whenever injury or damage covered by said motor vehicle liability policy occurs; said policy may not be canceled or annulled as to such liability by any agreement between the insurance carrier and the insured after the occurrence of the injury or damage; no statement made by the insured or on his or her behalf and no violation of said policy defeats or voids said policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The satisfaction by the insured of a judgment for such injury or damage shall not be a condition precedent to the right or duty of the insurance carrier to make payment on account of such injury or damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The insurance carrier may settle any claim covered by the policy, and if such settlement is made in good faith, the amount thereof is deductible from the limits of liability specified in subsection (2)(b) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The policy, the written application therefor, if any, and any rider or endorsement which does not conflict with the provisions of this chapter constitutes the entire contract between the parties.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excess or additional coverage. Any policy which grants the coverage required for a motor vehicle liability policy may also grant any lawful coverage in excess of or in addition to the coverage specified for a motor vehicle liability policy, and such excess or additional coverage is not subject to the provisions of this chapter. With respect to a policy which grants such excess or additional coverage the term &quot;motor vehicle liability policy&quot; applies only to that part of the coverage which is required by this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reimbursement provision permitted. Any motor vehicle liability policy may provide that the insured shall reimburse the insurance carrier for any payment the insurance carrier would not have been obligated to make under the terms of the policy except for the provisions of this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proration of insurance permitted. Any motor vehicle liability policy may provide for the prorating of the insurance thereunder with other valid and collectible insurance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple policies. The requirements for a motor vehicle liability policy may be fulfilled by the policies of one or more insurance carrier which policies together meet such requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Binders. Any binder issued pending the issuance of a motor vehicle liability policy is deemed to fulfill the requirements for such a policy.</p>

<p>The department shall upon request consent to the immediate cancellation of any bond or certificate of insurance, or the department shall direct and return to the person entitled thereto any money or securities deposited pursuant to this chapter as proof of financial responsibility, or the department shall waive the requirement of filing proof, in any of the following events:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>At any time after three years from the date such proof was required when, during the three-year period preceding the request, the department has not received record of a conviction, forfeiture of bail, or finding that a traffic infraction has been committed which would require or permit the suspension or revocation of the license of the person by or for whom such proof was furnished; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the event of the death of the person on whose behalf such proof was filed or the permanent incapacity of such person to operate a motor vehicle; or</p>

An affidavit of the applicant as to the nonexistence of such facts, or that he or she has been released from all of his or her liability, or has been finally adjudicated not to be liable, for such injury or damage, shall be sufficient evidence thereof in the absence of evidence to the contrary in the records of the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever any person whose proof has been canceled or returned under subsection (1)(c) of this section applies for a license within a period of three years from the date proof was originally required, any such application shall be refused unless the applicant shall reestablish such proof for the remainder of such three-year period.</p>
