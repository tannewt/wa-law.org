<p>The nonresident violator compact, hereinafter called &quot;the compact,&quot; is hereby established in the form substantially as follows, and the Washington state department of licensing is authorized to enter into such compact with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein:</p>
<p>NONRESIDENT VIOLATOR COMPACT</p>
<p>Article I — Findings, Declaration of Policy, and</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>The party jurisdictions find that:</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In most instances, a motorist who is cited for a traffic violation in a jurisdiction other than his home jurisdiction: Must post collateral or bond to secure appearance for trial at a later date; or if unable to post collateral or bond, is taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted; or is taken directly to court for his trial to be held.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In some instances, the motorist's driver's license may be deposited as collateral to be returned after he has complied with the terms of the citation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose of the practices described in paragraphs (1) and (2) above is to ensure compliance with the terms of a traffic citation by the motorist who, if permitted to continue on his way after receiving the traffic citation, could return to him [his] home jurisdiction and disregard his duty under the terms of the traffic citation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A motorist receiving a traffic citation in his home jurisdiction is permitted, except for certain violations, to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and to immediately continue on his way after promising or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The practice described in paragraph (1) above, causes unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the motorist who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay the fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some arrangement can be made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The deposit of a driver's license as a bail bond, as described in paragraph (2) above, is viewed with disfavor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The practices described herein consume an undue amount of law enforcement time.</p>
<ol type="a" start="2">
<li>It is the policy of the party jurisdictions to:</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seek compliance with the laws, ordinances, and administrative rules and regulations relating to the operation of motor vehicles in each of the jurisdictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow motorists to accept a traffic citation for certain violations and proceed on their way without delay whether or not the motorist is a resident of the jurisdiction in which the citation was issued.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the jurisdictions for obtaining compliance with the terms of a traffic citation issued in one jurisdiction to a resident of another jurisdiction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maximize effective utilization of law enforcement personnel and assist court systems in the efficient disposition of traffic violations.</p>
<ol type="a" start="3">
<li>The purpose of this compact is to:</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a means through which the party jurisdictions may participate in a reciprocal program to effectuate the policies enumerated in paragraph (b) above in a uniform and orderly manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of traffic violators operating within party jurisdictions in recognition of the motorist's right of due process and the sovereign status of a party jurisdiction.</p>
</li>

e. The licensing authority of the issuing jurisdiction may not suspend the privilege of a motorist for whom a report has been transmitted.

f. The licensing authority of the issuing jurisdiction shall not transmit a report on any violation if the date of transmission is more than six months after the date on which the traffic citation was issued.
