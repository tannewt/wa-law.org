<p>Every license issued under this chapter remains in force and effect until it has been surrendered, revoked, or suspended in accordance with this chapter. However, the director may on his or her own initiative reinstate suspended licenses or issue new licenses to a licensee whose license or licenses have been revoked if the director finds that the licensee meets all the requirements of this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A license issued under this chapter expires upon the licensee's failure to comply with the annual assessment requirements in RCW 31.04.085, and the rules. The department must provide notice of the expiration to the address of record provided by the licensee. On the 15th day after the department provides notice, if the assessment remains unpaid, the license expires. The licensee must receive notice prior to expiration and have the opportunity to stop the expiration as set forth in rule.</p>

<p>As used in this section, &quot;open-end loan&quot; means an agreement between a licensee and a borrower that expressly states that the loan is made in accordance with this chapter and that provides that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A licensee may permit the borrower to obtain advances of money from the licensee from time to time, or the licensee may advance money on behalf of the borrower from time to time as directed by the borrower;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amount of each advance and permitted charges and costs are debited to the borrower's account, and payments and other credits are credited to the same account;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The charges are computed on the unpaid principal balance, or balances, of the account from time to time; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The borrower has the privilege of paying the account in full at any time without prepayment penalty or, if the account is not in default, in monthly installments of fixed or determinable amounts as provided in the agreement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Interest charges on an open-end loan shall not exceed twenty-five percent per annum computed in each billing cycle by any of the following methods:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>By converting the annual rate to a daily rate, and multiplying the daily rate by the daily unpaid principal balance of the account, in which case each daily rate is determined by dividing the annual rate by three hundred sixty-five;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By multiplying a monthly rate by the average daily unpaid principal balance of the account in the billing cycle, in which case the monthly rate is one-twelfth of the annual rate, and the average daily unpaid principal balance is the sum of the amount unpaid each day during the cycle divided by the number of days in the cycle; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By converting the annual rate to a daily rate, and multiplying the daily rate by the average daily unpaid principal balance of the account in the billing cycle, in which case the daily rate is determined by dividing the annual rate by three hundred sixty-five, and the average daily unpaid principal balance is the sum of the amount unpaid each day during the cycle divided by the number of days in the cycle.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For all of the methods of computation specified in this subsection (2)(a), the billing cycle shall be monthly, and the unpaid principal balance on any day shall be determined by adding to the balance unpaid, as of the beginning of that day, all advances and other permissible amounts charged to the borrower, and deducting all payments and other credits made or received that day. A billing cycle is considered monthly if the closing date of the cycle is on the same date each month, or does not vary by more than four days from that date.</p>

<li>Reverse mortgage loans made in accordance with the Washington state reverse mortgage act are not subject to the interest charge computation restrictions or billing cycle requirements in this section.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>In addition to the charges permitted under subsection (2) of this section, the licensee may contract for and receive an annual fee, payable each year in advance, for the privilege of opening and maintaining an open-end loan account. Except as prohibited or limited by this section, the licensee may also contract for and receive on an open-end loan any additional charge permitted by this chapter on other loans, subject to the conditions and restrictions otherwise pertaining to those charges.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If credit life or credit disability insurance is provided, the additional charge for credit life insurance or credit disability insurance shall be calculated in each billing cycle by applying the current monthly premium rate for the insurance, at the rate approved by the insurance commissioner to the entire outstanding balances in the borrower's open-end loan account, or so much thereof as the insurance covers using any of the methods specified in subsection (2)(a) of this section for the calculation of interest charges; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The licensee shall not cancel credit life or disability insurance written in connection with an open-end loan because of delinquency of the borrower in the making of the required minimum payments on the loan, unless one or more of the payments is past due for a period of ninety days or more; and the licensee shall advance to the insurer the amounts required to keep the insurance in force during that period, which amounts may be debited to the borrower's account.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A security interest in real or personal property may be taken to secure an open-end loan. Any such security interest may be retained until the open-end account is terminated. The security interest shall be promptly released if (a) there has been no outstanding balance in the account for twelve months and the borrower either does not have or surrenders the unilateral right to create a new outstanding balance; or (b) the account is terminated at the borrower's request and paid in full.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The licensee may from time to time increase the rate of interest being charged on the unpaid principal balance of the borrower's open-end loans if the licensee mails or delivers written notice of the change to the borrower at least thirty days before the effective date of the increase unless the increase has been earlier agreed to by the borrower. However, the borrower may choose to terminate the open-end account and the licensee shall allow the borrower to repay the unpaid balance incurred before the effective date of the rate increase upon the existing open-end loan account terms and interest rate unless the borrower incurs additional debt on or after the effective date of the rate increase or otherwise agrees to the new rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The licensee shall deliver a copy of the open-end loan agreement to the borrower at the time the open-end account is created. The agreement must contain the name and address of the licensee and of the principal borrower, and must contain such specific disclosures as may be required by rule of the director. In adopting the rules the director shall consider Regulation Z promulgated by the board of governors of the federal reserve system under the federal consumer credit protection act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except in the case of an account that the licensee deems to be uncollectible, or with respect to which delinquency collection procedures have been instituted, the licensee shall deliver to the borrower at the end of each billing cycle in which there is an outstanding balance of more than one dollar in the account, or with respect to which interest is imposed, a periodic statement in the form required by the director. In specifying such form the director shall consider Regulation Z promulgated by the board of governors of the federal reserve system under the federal consumer credit protection act.</p>

<li>
<p>No licensee may make a loan using any method of calculating interest other than the simple interest method; except that the add-on method of calculating interest may be used for a loan not secured by real property or personal property used as a residence when the repayment period does not exceed three years and fifteen days after the loan origination date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No licensee may make a loan using the add-on method to calculate interest that does not provide for a refund to the borrower or a credit to the borrower's account of any unearned interest when the loan is repaid before the original maturity date in full by cash, by a new loan, by refinancing, or otherwise before the final due date. The refund must be calculated using the actuarial method, unless a sum equal to two or more installments has been prepaid and the account is not in arrears and continues to be paid ahead, in which case the interest on the account must be recalculated by the simple interest method with the refund of unearned interest made as if the loan had been made using the simple interest method. When computing an actuarial refund, the lender may round the annual rate used to the nearest quarter of one percent.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In computing a required refund of unearned interest, a prepayment made on or before the fifteenth day after the scheduled payment date is deemed to have been made on the payment date preceding the prepayment. In the case of prepayment before the first installment due date, the company may retain an amount not to exceed one-thirtieth of the first month's interest charge for each day between the origination date of the loan and the actual date of prepayment.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>No licensee may provide credit life or disability insurance in an amount greater than that required to pay off the total balance owing on the date of the borrower's death net of refunds in the case of credit life insurance, or all minimum payments that become due on the loan during the covered period of disability in the case of credit disability insurance. The lender may not require any such insurance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except in the case of loans by mail, where the borrower has sufficient time to review papers before returning them, no licensee may prepare loan papers in advance of the loan closing without having reviewed with the borrower the terms and conditions of the loan to include the type and amount of insurance, if any, requested by the borrower.</p>

If a servicer uses the scheduled method of accounting, any regularly scheduled payment made prior to the scheduled due date must be credited no later than the due date. If any payment is received and not credited, or treated as credited, the borrower must be notified of the disposition of the payment within ten business days by mail at the borrower's last known address. The notification must identify the reason the payment was not credited or treated as credited to the account, as well as any actions the borrower must take to make the residential mortgage loan current;</p>

The request must include the name and account number, if any, of the borrower, a statement that the account is or may be in error, and provide sufficient detail to the servicer regarding information sought by the borrower. If requested by the borrower this statement must include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A copy of the original note, or if unavailable, an affidavit of lost note; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A statement that identifies and itemizes all fees and charges assessed under the loan transaction and provides a full payment history identifying in a clear and conspicuous manner all of the debits, credits, application of and disbursement of all payments received from or for the benefit of the borrower, and other activity on the residential mortgage loan including escrow account activity and suspense account activity, if any. The period of the account history must cover at a minimum the two-year period prior to the date of the receipt of the request for information. If the servicer has not serviced the residential mortgage loan for the entire two-year time period the servicer must provide the information going back to the date on which the servicer began servicing the home loan, and identify the previous servicer, if known. If the servicer claims that any delinquent or outstanding sums are owed on the home loan prior to the two-year period or the period during which the servicer has serviced the residential mortgage loan, the servicer must provide an account history beginning with the month that the servicer claims any outstanding sums are owed on the residential mortgage loan up to the date of the request for the information.

<ol>
<li>
<p>In addition to complying with any applicable federal program requirements, a student education loan servicer must comply with the following requirements:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Any fee that is assessed by a servicer must be assessed within forty-five days of the date on which the fee was incurred and must be explained clearly and conspicuously in a statement mailed to the borrower at the borrower's last known address no more than thirty days after assessing the fee, or provided via email if the borrower has assented to receive electronic communications;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All amounts received by a servicer on a student education loan at the address where the borrower has been instructed to make payments must be accepted and credited, or treated as credited, within one business day of the date received, provided that the borrower has provided sufficient information to credit the account. If a servicer uses the scheduled method of accounting, any regularly scheduled payment made prior to the scheduled due date must be credited no later than the due date. If any payment is received and not credited, or treated as credited, the borrower must be notified of the disposition of the payment within ten business days by mail at the borrower's last known address. The notification must identify the reason the payment was not credited or treated as credited to the account, as well as any actions the borrower must take to make the student education loan current;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The servicer must make reasonable attempts to comply with a borrower's request for information about the student education loan account and to respond to any dispute initiated by the borrower about the loan account. The servicer:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Must maintain written or electronic records of each written request for information regarding a dispute or error involving the borrower's account until the student education loan is paid in full, sold, or otherwise satisfied; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must provide a written statement to the borrower within fifteen business days of receipt of a written request from the borrower. The borrower's request must include the name and account number, if any, of the borrower, a statement that the account is or may be in error, and sufficient detail regarding the information sought by the borrower to permit the servicer to comply. At a minimum, the servicer's response to the borrower's request must include the following information:</p>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>In the event that a borrower applies for or attempts to certify progress toward a discharge or refund of amounts paid on their federal student education loans with the United States department of education, the servicer must provide explanations to the borrower on any decision made with respect to their application.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, a borrower may request more detailed information from a servicer, and the servicer must provide the information within fifteen business days of receipt of a written request from the borrower. The request must include the name and account number, if any, of the borrower, a statement that the account is or may be in error, and provide sufficient detail to the servicer regarding information sought by the borrower. If requested by the borrower this statement must include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A copy of the original note, or if unavailable, an affidavit of lost note; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A statement that identifies and itemizes all fees and charges assessed under the loan transaction and provides a full payment history identifying in a clear and conspicuous manner all of the debits, credits, application of and disbursement of all payments received from or for the benefit of the borrower, and other activity on the student education loan including suspense account activity, if any. The period of the account history must cover at a minimum the two-year period prior to the date of the receipt of the request for information. If the servicer has not serviced the student education loan for the entire two-year time period the servicer must provide the information going back to the date on which the servicer began servicing the loan, and identify the previous servicer, if known. If the servicer claims that any delinquent or outstanding sums are owed on the loan prior to the two-year period or the period during which the servicer has serviced the student education loan, the servicer must provide an account history beginning with the month that the servicer claims any outstanding sums are owed on the student education loan up to the date of the request for the information. The borrower may request annually one statement free of charge.</p>

The initial term of the letter of credit must be at least two years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The financial institution that provides the letter of credit as required in (a) of this subsection may not be affiliated with the licensee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A licensee with a rating of either 4A1 or 5A1 from Dun &amp; Bradstreet credit services for three consecutive years is exempt from the requirements set forth in (a) of this subsection.</p>

<p>The licensee shall maintain a minimum capital of ten million dollars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A licensee may rely on the capital of its parent to satisfy the requirement of subsection (2) of this section.

<p>The department of financial institutions has specific authority to develop rules regarding the interpretation and implementation of this section. A proprietary reverse mortgage loan must comply with all of the following requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section prepayment, in whole or in part, or the refinancing of a reverse mortgage loan, is permitted without penalty at any time during the term of the reverse mortgage loan. For the purposes of this section, penalty does not include any fees, payments, or other charges, not including interest, that would have otherwise been due upon the reverse mortgage being due and payable. However, when a reverse mortgage lender has paid or waived all of the usual fees or costs associated with a reverse mortgage loan, a prepayment penalty may be imposed, provided the penalty does not exceed the total amount of the usual fees or costs that were initially absorbed or waived by the reverse mortgage lender. A mortgagee may not impose a prepayment penalty under this subsection if the prepayment is caused by the occurrence of the death of the borrowers. A borrower must be provided prior written notice of any permissible prepayment penalty under this section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A reverse mortgage loan may provide for a fixed or adjustable interest rate or combination thereof, including compound interest, and may also provide for interest that is contingent on the value of the property upon execution of the loan or at maturity, or on changes in value between closing and maturity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lender shall pay a late charge to the borrower for any late advance. If the lender does not mail or electronically transfer a scheduled monthly advance to the borrower on the first business day of the month, or within five business days of the date the lender receives the request, or such other regularly scheduled contractual date, the late charge is ten percent of the entire amount that should have been paid to the borrower for that month or as a result of that request. For each additional day that the lender fails to make the advance, the lender shall pay interest on the late advance at the interest rate stated in the loan documents. If the loan documents provide for an adjustable interest rate, the rate in effect when the late charge first accrues is used. Any late charge is paid from the lender's funds and may not be added to the unpaid principal balance. Additionally, the lender forfeits the right to interest and a monthly servicing fee for any months in which the advance has not been timely made. This section does not affect the department of financial institution's ability to impose other sanctions to protect consumers of reverse mortgage loans;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reverse mortgage loan may become due and payable upon the occurrence of any one of the following events:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The home securing the loan is sold or title to the home is otherwise transferred;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All borrowers cease occupying the home as a principal residence, except as provided in subsection (5) of this section; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A defaulting event occurs which is specified in the loan documents;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repayment of the reverse mortgage loan is subject to the following additional conditions:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Temporary absences from the home not exceeding one hundred eighty consecutive days do not cause the mortgage to become due and payable;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extended absences from the home exceeding one hundred eighty consecutive days, but less than one year, do not cause the mortgage to become due and payable if the borrower has taken prior action that secures and protects the home in a manner satisfactory to the lender, as specified in the loan documents;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lender's right to collect reverse mortgage loan proceeds is subject to the applicable statute of limitations for written loan contracts. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the statute of limitations shall commence on the date that the reverse mortgage loan becomes due and payable as provided in the loan agreement; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using conspicuous, bold sixteen-point or larger type, the lender shall disclose in the loan agreement any interest rate or other fees to be charged during the period that commences on the date that the reverse mortgage loan becomes due and payable, and that ends when repayment in full is made;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first page of any deed of trust securing a reverse mortgage loan must contain the following statement in sixteen-point boldface type: &quot;This deed of trust secures a reverse mortgage loan;&quot;</p>
</li>

<p>&quot;Important notice to reverse mortgage loan applicant</p>
<p>A reverse mortgage is a complex financial transaction that provides a means of using the equity you have built up in your home, or the value of your home, as a way to access home equity.</p>
<p>If you decide to obtain a reverse mortgage loan, you will sign binding legal documents that will have important legal, tax, and financial implications for you and your estate.</p>
<p>It is very important for you to understand the terms of the reverse mortgage and its effect. Before entering into this transaction, you are required by law to consult with an independent loan counselor. A list of approved counselors will be provided to you by the lender or broker. You may also want to discuss your decision with family members or others on whom you rely for financial advice.&quot;</p>

<p>As part of the disclosure required under this section, the lender or servicer shall provide an annual, or more frequent, disclosure statement to the borrower, providing details of the loan advances, balance, other terms, and the name and telephone number of the lender's employee or agent who has been specifically designated to respond to inquiries concerning reverse mortgage loans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to any other loan documentation or disclosure, prior to execution of the loan and at the end of the loan term, the lender may either obtain an independent appraisal of the property value or use the current year's tax assessment valuation of the property. Copies of these appraisals must be timely provided to the borrower within five days of the borrower's written request, provided the borrower has paid for the appraisal.</p>
