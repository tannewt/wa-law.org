The organization of any fire protection district previously formed is hereby approved and confirmed as a legally organized fire protection district in the state of Washington.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county auditor shall, within thirty days from the date of filing the petition, examine the signatures and certify to the sufficiency or insufficiency of the signatures.

Each of these other auditors shall certify to the lead auditor both the total number of registered voters residing in that portion of the proposed fire protection district that is located in the county and the number of valid signatures of such voters who have signed the petition. The lead auditor shall certify the sufficiency or insufficiency of the signatures. The books and records of the auditor shall be prima facie evidence of the truth of the certificate. No person having signed the petition is allowed to withdraw his or her name after the filing of the petition with the county auditor.</p>

<p>As an alternative to the petition method of formation for fire protection districts provided in this chapter, the legislative authority of a city or town may by resolution, subject to the approval of the voters, establish a fire protection district with boundaries that are the same as the corporate boundaries of the city or town for the provision of fire prevention services, fire suppression services, and emergency medical services, and for the protection of life and property within the city or town.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Any resolution adopted by a city or town under this section to establish a fire protection district must, at a minimum:</p>
<ol type="i">

<p>Contain a financing plan for the fire protection district. As part of the financing plan, the city or town may propose the imposition of revenue sources authorized by this title for fire protection districts, such as property taxes, as provided in chapter 52.16 RCW, or benefit charges, as provided in chapter 52.18 RCW; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set a date for a public hearing on the resolution.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The city's or town's highest lawful levy for the purposes of RCW 84.55.092, reduced by the fire protection district's levy amount from (b)(i) of this subsection. This reduced highest lawful levy becomes the city's or town's highest lawful levy since 1986 for subsequent levy limit calculations under chapter 84.55 RCW; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The estimated aggregate net dollar amount impact on property owners within the city or town based on the changes described in (b)(i) and (ii) of this subsection (1).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a city or town proposes the initial imposition of a benefit charge as a revenue source for the fire protection district under (a) of this subsection, the resolution adopted by the city or town must comply with the requirements of RCW 52.18.030.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notice of public hearing on a resolution adopted by a city or town must be published for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the city or town, and must be posted for at least fifteen days prior to the date of the hearing in three public places within the boundaries of the proposed fire protection district.

<p>A resolution adopted under this section is not effective unless approved by the voters of the city or town at a general election. The resolution must be approved:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>By a simple majority of the voters of the city or town; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the resolution proposes the initial imposition of a benefit charge, by sixty percent of the voters of the city or town.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>An election to approve or reject a resolution forming a fire protection district, including the proposed financial plan and any imposition of revenue sources for the fire protection district, must be conducted by the election officials of the county or counties in which the proposed district is located in accordance with the general election laws of the state. If a resolution forming a fire protection district provides that the fire protection district will be governed by a board of fire commissioners, as permitted under RCW 52.14.140, then the initial fire commissioners must be elected at the same election where the resolution is submitted to the voters authorizing the creation of the fire protection district. The election must be held at the next general election date, according to RCW 29A.04.321 and 29A.04.330, occurring after the date of the public hearing on the resolution adopted by the city or town legislative authority. The ballot title must include the information regarding property taxes that is required to be in the financing plan of the resolution under subsection (1)(b) of this section.</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A city or town must reduce its general fund regular property tax levy by the total combined levy of the fire protection district as proposed by the district in accordance with subsection (1)(b)(i) of this section. The reduced levy amount of the city or town must occur in the first year in which the fire protection district imposes any of the property taxes in RCW 52.16.130, 52.16.140, or 52.16.160 and must be specified in the financing plan and ballot proposition as provided in this section. If the fire protection district does not impose all three levies under RCW 52.16.130, 52.16.140, and 52.16.160 when it begins operations, the city must further reduce its general fund regular property tax levy if the district initially imposes any of the levies in subsequent years, by the amount of such levy or levies initially imposed in a subsequent year.</p>

<p>A fire protection district may establish an ambulance service to be operated as a public utility. However, the fire protection district may not provide for the establishment of an ambulance service utility that would compete with any existing private ambulance service unless the fire protection district determines that the area served by the fire protection district, or a substantial portion of that area, is not adequately served by an existing private ambulance service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining the adequacy of an existing private ambulance service, the fire protection district must take into consideration objective generally accepted medical standards and reasonable levels of service, which must be published by the fire protection district. If a fire protection district makes a preliminary conclusion that an existing private ambulance service is inadequate, the fire protection district must allow a minimum of sixty days for the private ambulance service to meet the generally accepted medical standards and accepted levels of service. If the fire protection district makes a second preliminary conclusion of inadequacy within a twenty-four month period, the fire protection district may immediately issue a call for bids or establish its own ambulance service utility and is not required to afford the private ambulance service another sixty-day period to meet the generally accepted medical standards and reasonable levels of service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A private ambulance service that is not licensed by the department of health, or has had its license denied, suspended, or revoked, is not entitled to a sixty-day period to demonstrate adequacy, and the fire protection district may immediately issue a call for bids or establish an ambulance service utility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A private ambulance service that abandons service in the area served by the fire protection district, or a substantial portion of the area served by the fire protection district, is not entitled to a sixty-day period to demonstrate adequacy, and the fire protection district may immediately issue a call for bids or establish an ambulance service utility. If a fire protection district becomes aware of an intent to abandon service at a future date, the fire protection district may immediately issue a call for bids or establish an ambulance service utility to avoid an interruption in service.</p>
