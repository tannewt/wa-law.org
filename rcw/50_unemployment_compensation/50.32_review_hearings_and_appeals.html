<p>The commissioner shall establish one or more impartial appeal tribunals, each of which shall consist of an administrative law judge appointed under chapter 34.12 RCW who shall decide the issues submitted to the tribunal. No administrative law judge may hear or decide any disputed claim in any case in which he or she is an interested party. Wherever the term &quot;appeal tribunal&quot; or &quot;the appeal tribunal&quot; is used in this title the same refers to an appeal tribunal established under the provisions of this section. Notice of any appeal or petition for hearing taken to an appeal tribunal in any proceeding under this title may be filed with such agency as the commissioner may by regulation prescribe.</p>

<p>The applicant or claimant, his or her most recent employing unit or any interested party which the commissioner by regulation prescribes, may file an appeal from any determination or redetermination with the appeal tribunal within thirty days after the date of notification or mailing, whichever is earlier, of such determination or redetermination to his or her last known address: PROVIDED, That in the event an appeal with respect to any determination is pending as of the date when a redetermination thereof is issued, such appeal, unless withdrawn, shall be treated as an appeal from such redetermination. Any appeal from a determination of denial of benefits which is effective for an indefinite period shall be deemed to be an appeal as to all weeks subsequent to the effective date of the denial for which benefits have already been denied. If no appeal is taken from any determination, or redetermination, within the time allowed by the provisions of this section for appeal therefrom, said determination, or redetermination, as the case may be, shall be conclusively deemed to be correct except as hereinbefore provided in respect to reconsideration by the commissioner of any determination.</p>

<p>When an order and notice of assessment has been served upon or mailed to a delinquent employer, as heretofore provided, such employer may within thirty days thereafter file a petition in writing with the appeal tribunal, stating that such assessment is unjust or incorrect and requesting a hearing thereon. Such petition shall set forth the reasons why the assessment is objected to and the amount of contributions, if any, which said employer admits to be due the employment security department. If no such petition be filed with the appeal tribunal within thirty days, the assessment shall be conclusively deemed to be just and correct: PROVIDED, That in such cases, and in cases where payment of contributions, interest, or penalties has been made pursuant to a jeopardy assessment, the commissioner may properly entertain a subsequent application for refund. The filing of a petition on a disputed assessment with the appeal tribunal shall stay the distraint and sale proceeding provided for in this title until a final decision thereon shall have been made, but the filing of such petition shall not affect the right of the commissioner to perfect a lien, as provided by this title, upon the property of the employer. The filing of a petition on a disputed assessment shall stay the accrual of interest and penalties on the disputed contributions until a final decision shall have been made thereon.</p>
<p>Within thirty days after notice of denial of refund or adjustment has been mailed or delivered (whichever is the earlier) to an employer, the employer may file a petition in writing with the appeal tribunal for a hearing thereon: PROVIDED, That this right shall not apply in those cases in which assessments have been appealed from and have become final. The petitioner shall set forth the reasons why such hearing should be granted and the amount which the petitioner believes should be adjusted or refunded. If no such petition be filed within said thirty days, the determination of the commissioner as stated in said notice shall be final.</p>
