<p>When authorized by the director, one or more natural persons, citizens of the United States, may incorporate a stock savings bank in the manner prescribed under this chapter. No stock savings bank may incorporate for less amount nor commence business unless it has a paid-in capital stock, surplus and undivided profits in the amount as may be determined by the director after consideration of the proposed location, management, and the population and economic characteristics for the area, the nature of the proposed activities and operation of the stock savings bank, and other factors deemed pertinent by the director. Before commencing business, each stock savings bank shall have subscribed and paid into it in the same manner as is required for capital stock, an amount equal to at least ten percent of the capital stock required, that shall be carried in the undivided profit account and may be used to defray organization and operating expenses of the company. Any sum not so used shall be transferred to the surplus fund of the company before any dividend shall be declared to the stockholders.</p>

<p>Before any stock savings bank is authorized to do business, and within ninety days after approval of the articles of incorporation or such other time as the director may allow, it shall furnish proof satisfactory to the director that such corporation has a paid-in capital in the amount determined by the director, that the requisite surplus or reserve fund has been accumulated or paid in cash, and that it has in good faith complied with all the requirements of law and fulfilled all the conditions precedent to commencing business imposed by this title.

<p>Every corporation authorized by the laws of this state to do business as a stock savings bank, which corporation shall have failed to organize and commence business within six months after certificate of authority to commence business has been issued by the director, shall forfeit its rights and privileges as such corporation, which fact the director shall certify to the secretary of state, and such certificate of forfeiture shall be filed and recorded in the office of the secretary of state in the same manner as the certificate of authority.

<p>At any time not less than one year prior to the expiration of the time of the existence of any mutual savings bank or stock savings bank, it may by written application to the director, signed and verified by a majority of its directors and approved in writing by the owners of not less than two-thirds of its capital stock, apply to the director for leave to file amended articles of incorporation, extending its time of existence. Prior to acting upon such application, the director shall make such investigation of the applicant as he or she deems necessary. If the director determines that the applicant is in sound condition, that it is conducting its business in a safe manner and in compliance with law and that no reason exists why it should not be permitted to continue, he or she shall issue to the applicant a certificate authorizing it to file amended articles of incorporation extending the time of its existence until such time as it be dissolved by the act of its shareholders owning not less than two-thirds of its stock, or until its certificate of authority becomes revoked or forfeited by reason of violation of law, or until its affairs be taken over by the director for legal cause and finally wound up by him or her. Otherwise the director shall notify the applicant that he or she refuses to grant such certificate. The applicant may appeal from such refusal in the same manner as in the case of a refusal to grant an original certificate of authority. Otherwise the determination of the director shall be conclusive.</p>
<p>Upon receiving a certificate, as hereinabove provided, the applicant may file amended articles of incorporation, extending the time of its existence for the term authorized, to which shall be attached a copy of the certificate of the director. Such articles shall be filed in the same manner and upon payment of the same fees as for original articles of incorporation.</p>
<p>Should any mutual savings bank or stock savings bank fail to continue its existence in the manner provided and be not previously dissolved, the director shall at the end of its original term of existence immediately take possession of the corporation and wind up its affairs in the same manner as in the case of insolvency.</p>

<p>Shares of a stock savings bank may, but need not be, represented by certificates. Unless this title expressly provides otherwise, the rights and obligations of shareholders are identical whether or not their shares are represented by certificates. At a minimum, each share certificate must state the information required to be stated and must be signed as provided in RCW 23B.06.250 and/or 23B.06.270 for corporations.</p>

<p>Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise, the board of directors of a stock savings bank may authorize the issue of some or all of the shares of any or all of its classes or series without certificates.
