<p>The maintenance, enlargement and extension of diking, drainage and sewerage improvement districts formed under chapter 85.08 RCW is essential to the public welfare and economy of the state. The influx of population and changes in land use since many such districts were formed, has made obsolete, expensive and unjust the method used under existing law to provide funds for the operation of such districts and for the maintenance and expansion of their systems of improvement.</p>

<p>&quot;District&quot; means a diking, drainage or sewerage improvement district organized under chapter 85.08 RCW.</p>
<p>&quot;Maintenance&quot; means and includes not merely operating expenses and such upkeep and other work commonly classed as maintenance as shall be necessary to restore and preserve the district's systems of improvement and the machinery and equipment operated in connection therewith in the same or as good condition as when originally constructed and installed, but also the making of such changes in and betterments to the original works, improvements and installations as shall, subject to approval of the board of county commissioners, be by the board deemed necessary to put the systems of improvements into such condition as will provide protection and services as contemplated and intended by the original construction and any enlargement and extensions thereof thereafter made.</p>

<p>To operate under this chapter, the board of commissioners of the improvement district shall cause to be prepared and filed with the board of county commissioners a property roll. The roll shall contain: (1) A description of all properties benefited and improvements thereon which receive protection and service from the systems of the district with the name of the owner or the reputed owner thereof and his or her address as shown on the tax rolls of the assessor or treasurer of the county wherein the property is located and (2) the determined value of such land and improvements thereon as last assessed and equalized by the assessor of such county or counties. Such assessed and equalized values shall be deemed prima facie to be just, fair, and correct valuations against which annual taxes shall be levied for the operation of the district and the maintenance and expansion of its facilities.</p>
<p>If property outside of the limits of the original district are upon the roll as adopted ultimately, and the original district has outstanding bonds or long-term warrants, the board of county commissioners shall set up separate dollar rate levies for the full retirement thereof.</p>
