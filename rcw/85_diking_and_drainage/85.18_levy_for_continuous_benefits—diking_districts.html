<p>The state declares that it has an interest in protecting and preserving productive land and buildings needed to make business function continuously. Where organized diking districts, through their improvements, have reclaimed land or protected it from overflow and have enabled erection of improvements thereon or have furnished such land and buildings protection against flood water, it is necessary to provide a just and equitable method to enable such diking districts continuously to function effectively. It is declared that there is a direct relationship, where such conditions exist, between the continuous functioning of such districts and the fair value of the lands and buildings thereon, or to be erected thereon, thus afforded protection.</p>

<p>When any diking district has been organized and the improvements made afford protection to land and buildings within such district against damage or destruction from overflow waters in that the level of the land and of the foundational structures of buildings thereon is below the water level at flood or high tide stages of the waters, fresh or salt, against which such district improvements furnished protection, the board of diking commissioners of such district may, under the procedure established in this chapter, determine such fact and by resolution so declare; and may provide that the cost of continued functioning of the district shall be paid through levies of dollar rates made and collected according to this chapter against the land and buildings thus protected, based upon the determined base benefits received by such land and buildings.</p>
