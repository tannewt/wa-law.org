<p>A summons stating briefly the objects of the petition and containing a description of the land, real estate, premises or property sought to be appropriated, and those which it is claimed to be benefited by the improvement, and stating the court wherein the petition is filed, the date of the filing thereof and when the defendants are required to appear (which shall be ten days, exclusive of the day of service, if served within the county in which the petition is pending, and if in any other county, then twenty days after such service, and if served by publication, then within thirty days from the date of the first publication), shall be served on each and every person named therein as owner, encumbrancer, tenant or otherwise interested therein.

In all cases where the owner or person claiming an interest in the real or other property is a nonresident of this state, or where the residence of the owner or person is unknown, and an affidavit of one or more of the commissioners of the district shall be filed that the owner or person is a nonresident of this state, or that after diligent inquiry his residence is unknown or cannot be ascertained by the deponent, service may be made by publication thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the lands are situated, once a week for three successive weeks. The publication shall be deemed service upon each nonresident person or persons whose residence is unknown. The summons may be served by any competent person eighteen years of age or over. Due proof of service of the summons by affidavit or publication shall be filed with the clerk of the court before the court shall proceed to hear the matter. Want of service of notice shall render the subsequent proceedings void as to the person not served; but all persons or parties having been served with summons as herein provided, either by publication or otherwise, shall be bound by the subsequent proceedings. In all cases not otherwise provided for service of notice, order and other papers in the proceedings authorized by this chapter may be made as the superior court, or the judge thereof, may direct: PROVIDED, That personal service upon any party outside of the state shall be of like effect as service by publication.</p>

<p>Any or all of said defendants may appear jointly or separately and admit or deny the allegations of said petition and plead any affirmative matter in defense thereof at the time and place appointed for hearing said petition, or to which the same may have been adjourned.
