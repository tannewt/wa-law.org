<p>Whenever, after the determination of special benefits accruing from the maintenance of the district's system of improvements, it appears to the board from a petition filed by the affected property owner or owners or otherwise, that by reason of permanent improvements or additions made, removed, abandoned or destroyed by fire or other casualty, or of other changes in the character or condition of the property, the benefits theretofore determined in respect to any one or more pieces or parcels of property are no longer fair, just and equitable, then the board shall appoint three appraisers who shall qualify as in RCW 85.08.360 hereof. Said appraisers shall proceed immediately to carefully examine the pieces or parcels of property as to which since the last determination of special benefits thereto there have been permanent improvements or additions made, removed, abandoned or destroyed by fire or other casualty or other changes in the character or condition of the property. Said appraisers shall file their sworn report with the board setting forth the special benefits determined by them as accruing to each piece and parcel of property examined by them not less than ten days prior to the date of hearing. The board shall hold a hearing thereon at the county seat at the time of equalization of the real property assessment and shall give notice thereof as provided in RCW 85.16.070.</p>

<p>At such hearing, which may be adjourned from time to time as may be necessary to give all persons interested or affected a reasonable opportunity to be heard, and after consideration of all evidence offered and all factors, situations, and conditions bearing upon or determinative of the benefits accruing and to accrue to such pieces or parcels of property, the board shall correct, revise, raise, lower, or otherwise change or confirm the benefits as theretofore determined, in respect of such pieces or parcels of property, as to it shall seem fair, just, and equitable under the circumstances, and thereafter such proceedings shall be had with respect to the confirmation or determination of the benefits and making and filing of a roll thereof, as are in RCW 85.16.130, 85.16.150, and 85.16.160 provided. Any property owner affected by any change thus made in the determination of benefits accruing to his or her property who shall have appeared at the hearing by the board and made written objections thereto as provided in RCW 85.16.130, may appeal from the action of the board to the superior court and seek appellate review by the supreme court or the court of appeals, within the time, in the manner and upon the conditions, so far as applicable, provided in RCW 85.08.440, with respect to appeals from the order of the board confirming the apportionment of the original cost of construction.</p>

<p>Whenever any payer of a diking, drainage, or sewerage improvement district maintenance assessment believes that, through obvious error in name, number, description, amount of benefit valuation, double assessment, or extension, or other obvious error, property on which he or she has paid an assessment has been erroneously assessed, he or she may pay such assessment under protest. If, within thirty days after such payment under protest, he or she files with the board a written verified petition setting out his or her name, address, and legal description of the property, the nature of the obvious error alleged to have been made, and the date and amount of any assessment paid thereon, the board shall cause such claim to be investigated. If upon investigation any assessment is found to be erroneous through obvious error, the board shall order such assessment to be corrected if no bond or long term warrant issue is affected. Where correction is ordered of an erroneous assessment already collected, the auditor, upon receipt of a certified copy of the board's order of correction, shall refund to the person paying the assessment the difference between the correct assessment and the erroneous assessment, plus legal interest on such difference from date of payment, by a warrant drawn on the maintenance fund of the district.</p>
