In the construction of any system of improvement the board of supervisors with the approval of the board of county commissioners may modify, curtail, enlarge or add to the original plans wherever the same may be found necessary or advisable in the course of actual construction. But such changes shall not in the aggregate increase the estimated cost of the entire system by more than one-fifth, and all additional or different rights-of-way required shall be obtained as hereinbefore prescribed.

<p>Unless the work of construction is let by contract as hereinbefore provided, or for such part of such work as is not covered by contract, the board of supervisors shall employ such number of persons as shall be necessary to successfully carry on the work of such construction, and shall give preference in such employment to persons owning land to be benefited by the improvement.</p>
<p>The provisions of this section shall not be construed as denying to the supervisors, in case the construction work is left in their hands, the power to enter into an agreement with any contractor to furnish labor, material, equipment and skilled supervision, the contractor to be compensated upon the basis of a specific sum, or upon a percentage of the cost of the work, the services of the contractor to cover the use of equipment and the value of skilled supervision: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That there is retained in the said board by the contract the right of termination thereof at any time, on reasonable notice, and fixing in the said contract, or reserving in said board, the right to fix the rates of wages to be paid to the persons employed in said work. The board of supervisors may also let contracts in such manner and on such notice as they deem advisable for items of construction not exceeding one thousand dollars in amount of expenditures.</p>

The waiver shall specify the month or period of months for which it is made.</p>
<p>The dollar thresholds established in this section must be adjusted for inflation by the office of financial management every five years, beginning January 1, 2024, based upon changes in the consumer price index during that time period. &quot;Consumer price index&quot; means, for any calendar year, that year's annual average consumer price index, for Washington state, for wage earners and clerical workers, all items, compiled by the bureau of labor and statistics, United States department of labor. If the bureau of labor and statistics develops more than one consumer price index for areas within the state, the index covering the greatest number of people, covering areas exclusively within the boundaries of the state, and including all items shall be used for the adjustments for inflation in this section. The office of financial management must calculate the new dollar threshold and transmit it to the office of the code reviser for publication in the Washington State Register at least one month before the new dollar threshold is to take effect.</p>
<p>A person holding office as commissioner for two or more special purpose districts shall receive only that per diem compensation authorized for one of his or her commissioner positions as compensation for attending an official meeting or conducting official services or duties while representing more than one of his or her districts.

As soon as convenient, within the time fixed in the notice, the public officers, corporation, or person shall, if they desire to construct such crossing, prepare and submit to the county engineer for approval duplicate detailed plans and specifications for such crossing. Upon submission of such plans, the county engineer shall examine and may modify the same to meet the requirements of the system of improvement, and when such plans or modified plans are satisfactory to the county engineer, he or she shall approve the same and return one thereof to the public officers, corporation, or person submitting the same, and file the duplicate in his or her office, and shall notify such public officers, corporation, or person of the time within which said crossing must be constructed. Upon the return of such approved plans, the public officers, corporation, or person controlling such road or public utility shall, within the time fixed by the county engineer, construct such crossing in accordance with the approved plans, and shall thereafter maintain the same. In case such public officers, corporation, or person controlling or owning such road or public utility shall fail to file plans for such crossing within the time prescribed in the notice, the board of supervisors or of county commissioners, as the case may be, shall proceed with the construction of such crossing in such manner as will cause no unnecessary injury to or interference with such road or public utility. The cost of construction and maintenance of only such crossings or such portion of such cost as would not have been necessary but for the construction of the system of improvement shall be a proper charge against the improvement district, and only so much of such cost as the board of county commissioners shall deem reasonable shall be allowed as a charge against the district in the case of crossings constructed by others than the district.
