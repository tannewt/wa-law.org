<p>The secretary shall also return all nonresident sexual psychopaths, psychopathic delinquents, or mentally ill persons who are now confined in or who may hereafter be committed to a state hospital for the sexual psychopath, psychopathic delinquent, or the mentally ill in this state to the states or state in which they may have a legal residence. For the purpose of facilitating the return of such persons the secretary may enter into a reciprocal agreement with any other state for the mutual exchange of sexual psychopaths, psychopathic delinquents, or mentally ill persons now confined in or hereafter committed to any hospital for the sexual psychopath, psychopathic delinquent, or the mentally ill in one state whose legal residence is in the other, and he or she may give written permission for the return of any resident of Washington now or hereafter confined in a hospital for the sexual psychopath, psychopathic delinquent, or the mentally ill in another state. Such residents may be returned directly to the proper Washington state institution without further court proceedings: PROVIDED, That if the superintendent of such institution is of the opinion that the returned person is not a sexual psychopath, a psychopathic delinquent, or mentally ill person he or she may discharge said patient: PROVIDED FURTHER, That if such superintendent deems such person a sexual psychopath, a psychopathic delinquent, or mentally ill person, he or she shall file an application for commitment within ninety days of arrival at the Washington institution.</p>
<p>A person shall be deemed to be a resident of this state within the meaning of this chapter who has maintained his or her domiciliary residence in this state for a period of one year preceding commitment to a state institution without receiving assistance from any tax supported organization and who has not subsequently acquired a domicile in another state: PROVIDED, That any period of time spent by such person while an inmate of a state hospital or state institution or while on parole, escape, or leave of absence therefrom shall not be counted in determining the time of residence in this or another state.</p>
<p>All expenses incurred in returning sexual psychopaths, psychopathic delinquents, or mentally ill persons from this to another state may be paid by this state, but the expense of returning residents of this state shall be borne by the state making the return. Mentally ill person for the purposes of this section shall be any person defined as mentally ill under RCW 72.23.010, as now or hereafter amended.</p>
