<p>A party participating may withdraw from the compact by formal resolution and by written notice to all other parties then participating.

Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing participant shall notify the other parties to retake the offenders it has housed in its facilities and shall remove to its facilities, at its own expense, offenders it has confined under the provisions of this compact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Legal costs relating to defending actions brought by an offender challenging his or her transfer to another jurisdiction under this compact shall be borne by the sending jurisdiction.

</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a county or the department may have with each other or with a nonparty county for the confinement, rehabilitation, or treatment of offenders.</p>

<li>
<p>The costs per offender day to the sending jurisdiction for the custody of offenders transferred according to the terms of this agreement shall be at the rate set by the state of Washington, office of financial management under RCW 70.48.440, unless the parties agree to another rate in a particular transfer.

Except in the case of prisoner exchanges, as described in subsection (2) of this section, the sending jurisdiction shall be billed on a monthly basis by the receiving jurisdiction. Payment shall be made within thirty days of receipt of the invoice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When two parties to this agreement transfer offenders to each other, there shall be an accounting of the number of &quot;offender days.&quot; If the number is exactly equal, no payment is necessary for the affected period. The payment by the jurisdiction with the higher net number of offender days may be reduced by the amount otherwise due for the number of offender days its offenders were held by the receiving jurisdiction. Billing and reimbursement shall remain on the monthly schedule, and shall be supported by the forms and procedures provided by applicable regulations. The accounting of offender days exchanged may be reconciled on a monthly basis, but shall be at least quarterly.</p>

<p>The secretary is empowered to enter into contracts on behalf of this state on the terms and conditions as may be appropriate to implement the participation of the department in the Washington intrastate corrections compact under RCW 72.76.010(2). Nothing in this chapter is intended to create any right or entitlement in any offender transferred or housed under the authority granted in this chapter. The failure of the department or the county to comply with any provision of this chapter as to any particular offender or transfer shall not invalidate the transfer nor give rise to any right for such offender.</p>

The secretary may use such funds, in addition to appropriated funds, to provide institutional and community corrections programs. The secretary may, in his or her discretion and in lieu of direct fiscal payment, offset the obligation of any sending jurisdiction against any obligation the department may have to the sending jurisdiction. Outstanding obligations of the sending jurisdiction may be carried forward across state fiscal periods by the department as a credit against future obligations of the department to the sending jurisdiction.</p>
