From and after July 1, 1973, any inmate employed in classes I, II, and IV of correctional industries as defined in RCW 72.09.100 is eligible for industrial insurance benefits as provided by Title 51 RCW. However, eligibility for benefits for either the inmate or the inmate's dependents or beneficiaries for temporary disability or permanent total disability as provided in RCW 51.32.090 or 51.32.060, respectively, shall not take effect until the inmate is released pursuant to an order of parole by the indeterminate sentence review board, or discharged from custody upon expiration of the sentence, or discharged from custody by order of a court of appropriate jurisdiction. Nothing in this section shall be construed to confer eligibility for any industrial insurance benefits to any inmate who is employed in class III or V of correctional industries as defined in RCW 72.09.100.

## 72.60.235 - Implementation plan for prison industries.
1. The department of corrections shall develop, in accordance with RCW 72.09.010, a site-specific implementation plan for prison industries space at Clallam Bay corrections center, McNeil Island corrections center, and the one thousand twenty-four bed medium security prison as appropriated for and authorized by the legislature.

2. Each implementation plan shall include, but not be limited to, sufficient space and design elements that try to achieve a target of twenty-five percent of the total inmates in class I employment programs and twenty-five percent of the total inmates in class II employment programs or as much of the target as possible without jeopardizing the efficient and necessary day-to-day operation of the prison. The implementation plan shall also include educational opportunities and employment, wage, and other incentives. The department shall include in the implementation plans an incentive program based on wages, and the opportunity to contribute all or a portion of their wages towards an array of incentives. The funds recovered from the sale, lease, or rental of incentives should be considered as a possible source of revenue to cover the capitalized cost of the additional space necessary to accommodate the increased class I and class II industries programs.

3. The incentive program shall be developed so that inmates can earn higher wages based on performance and production. Only those inmates employed in class I and class II jobs may participate in the incentive program. The department shall develop special program criteria for inmates with physical or mental disabilities so that they can participate in the incentive program.

4. The department shall propose rules specifying that inmate wages, other than the amount an inmate owes for taxes, legal financial obligations, and to the victim restitution fund, shall be returned to the department to pay for the cost of prison operations, including room and board.

5. The plan shall identify actual or potential legal or operational obstacles, or both, in implementing the components of the plan as specified in this section, and recommend strategies to remove the obstacles.

6. The department shall submit the plan to the appropriate committees of the legislature and to the governor by October 1, 1991.
