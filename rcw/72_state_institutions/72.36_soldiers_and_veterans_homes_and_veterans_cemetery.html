<p>The legislature finds that continued operation of state veterans' homes is necessary to meet the needs of eligible veterans for shelter, personal and nursing care, and related services; that certain residents of veterans' homes or services provided to them may be eligible for participation in the state's medicaid reimbursement system; and that authorizing medicaid participation is appropriate to address the homes' long-term funding needs. The legislature also finds that it is important to maintain the dignity and self-respect of residents of veterans' homes, by providing for continued resident involvement in the homes' operation, and through retention of current law guaranteeing a minimum amount of allowable personal income necessary to meet the greater costs for these residents of transportation, communication, and participation in family and community activities that are vitally important to their maintenance and rehabilitation.</p>
