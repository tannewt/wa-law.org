<p>The legislature finds that a guardianship is an appropriate permanent plan for a child who has been found to be dependent under chapter 13.34 RCW and who cannot safely be reunified with his or her parents. The legislature is concerned that parents not be pressured by the department into agreeing to the entry of a guardianship when further services would increase the chances that the child could be reunified with his or her parents. The legislature intends to create a separate guardianship chapter to establish permanency for children in foster care through the appointment of a guardian and dismissal of the dependency.</p>

<li>
<p>Any party to a dependency proceeding under chapter 13.34 RCW may request a guardianship be established for a dependent child by filing a petition in juvenile court under this chapter. All parties to the dependency and the proposed guardian must receive adequate notice of all proceedings under this chapter. Service of the notice and summons may be made under direction of the court by any person eighteen years of age or older who is not a party to the proceedings or by any law enforcement officer, probation counselor, or department employee. For purposes of this chapter, a dependent child age twelve years or older is a party to the proceedings. A proposed guardian has the right to intervene in proceedings under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be designated as a proposed guardian in a petition under this chapter, a person must be age twenty-one or over and must meet the minimum requirements to care for children as established by the department under RCW 74.15.030, including but not limited to licensed foster parents, relatives, and suitable persons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every petition filed in proceedings under this chapter shall contain: (a) A statement alleging whether the child is or may be an Indian child as defined in 25 U.S.C. Sec. 1903. If the child is an Indian child as defined under the Indian child welfare act, the provisions of that act shall apply; (b) a statement alleging whether the federal servicemembers civil relief act of 2003, 50 U.S.C. Sec. 501 et seq. applies to the proceeding; and (c) a statement alleging whether the Washington service members' civil relief act, chapter 38.42 RCW, applies to the proceeding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every order or decree entered in any proceeding under this chapter shall contain: (a) A finding that the Indian child welfare act does or does not apply. Where there is a finding that the Indian child welfare act does apply, the decree or order must also contain a finding that all notice requirements and evidentiary requirements under the Indian child welfare act have been satisfied; (b) a finding that the federal servicemembers civil relief act of 2003 does or does not apply; and (c) a finding that the Washington service members' civil relief act, chapter 38.42 RCW, does or does not apply.</p>

<p>At the hearing on a guardianship petition, all parties have the right to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. The rules of evidence apply to the conduct of the hearing. The hearing under this section to establish a guardianship or convert an existing dependency guardianship to a guardianship under this section is a stage of the dependency proceedings for purposes of RCW 13.34.090(2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A guardianship shall be established if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that it is in the child's best interests to establish a guardianship, rather than to terminate the parent-child relationship and proceed with adoption, or to continue efforts to return custody of the child to the parent; and</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>A dispositional order has been entered pursuant to RCW 13.34.130;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the time of the hearing on the guardianship petition, the child has or will have been removed from the custody of the parent for at least six consecutive months following a finding of dependency under RCW 13.34.030;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The services ordered under RCW 13.34.130 and 13.34.136 have been offered or provided and all necessary services, reasonably available, capable of correcting the parental deficiencies within the foreseeable future have been offered or provided;</p>

<li>
<p>There is little likelihood that conditions will be remedied so that the child can be returned to the parent in the near future; and</p>
</li>

<p>The proposed guardian has signed a statement acknowledging the guardian's rights and responsibilities toward the child and affirming the guardian's understanding and acceptance that the guardianship is a commitment to provide care for the child until the child reaches age eighteen.</p>

<p>The court may not establish a guardianship for a child who has no legal parent unless the court, in addition to making the required findings set forth in subsection (2) of this section, finds one or more exceptional circumstances exist and the benefits for the child of establishing the guardianship outweigh any potential disadvantage to the child of having no legal parent. Exceptional circumstances may include but are not limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The child has special needs and a suitable guardian is willing to accept custody and able to meet the needs of the child to an extent unlikely to be achieved through adoption; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proposed guardian has demonstrated a commitment to provide for the long-term care of the child and: (i) Is a relative of the child; (ii) has been a long-term caregiver for the child and has acted as a parent figure to the child and is viewed by the child as a parent figure; or (iii) the child's family has identified the proposed guardian as the preferred guardian, and, if the child is age twelve years or older, the child also has identified the proposed guardian as the preferred guardian.</p>

<p>Upon the request of a dependency guardian appointed under chapter 13.34 RCW and the department or supervising agency, the court shall convert a dependency guardianship established under chapter 13.34 RCW to a guardianship under this chapter.</p>

<p>If the court has made the findings required under RCW 13.36.040, the court shall issue an order establishing a guardianship for the child. If the guardian has not previously intervened, the guardian shall be made a party to the guardianship proceeding upon entry of the guardianship order. The order shall:</p>

<p>Right to consent to health care for the child and sign a release authorizing the sharing of health care information with appropriate authorities, in accordance with state law;</p>

<p>Right to consent to the child's participation in social and school activities; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duty to notify the court of a change of address of the guardian and the child. Unless specifically ordered by the court, however, the standards and requirements for relocation in chapter 26.09 RCW do not apply to guardianships established under this chapter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the child has independent funds or other valuable property under the control of the guardian, the guardian shall provide an annual written accounting, supported with appropriate documentation, to the court regarding receipt and expenditure by the guardian of any such funds or benefits. This subsection shall not be construed to require a guardian to account for any routine funds or benefits received from a public social service agency on behalf of the child.</p>

<p>The guardianship shall remain in effect until the child reaches the age of eighteen years or until the court terminates the guardianship, whichever occurs sooner.</p>
