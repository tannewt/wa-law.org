<p>EXECUTION OF THE COMPACT</p>
<p>The governor is hereby authorized and directed to execute a compact on behalf of this state with any other state or states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows. No provision of this compact will interfere with this state's authority to determine policy regarding juvenile offenders and nonoffenders within this state.</p>
<p>THE INTERSTATE COMPACT FOR JUVENILES</p>
<p>ARTICLE I - Purpose</p>
<p>The compacting states to this interstate compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents, and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped, or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that congress, by enacting the crime control act, 4 U.S.C. Sec. 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.</p>
<p>It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states, to: (1) Ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state; (2) ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected; (3) return juveniles who have run away, absconded, or escaped from supervision or control or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return; (4) make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services; (5) provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles; (6) equitably allocate the costs, benefits, and obligations of the compacting states; (7) establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or any other criminal or juvenile justice agency that has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders; (8) ensure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined offenders may travel or relocate across state lines; (9) establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders before transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact; (10) establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice administrators; (11) monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; (12) coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such activity; and (13) coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the interstate compact for the placement of children, the interstate compact for adult offender supervision, and other compacts affecting juveniles particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the interstate commission created in this section are the formation of public policies and therefore are public business. Furthermore, the compacting states shall cooperate and observe their individual and collective duties and responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles subject to the provisions of this compact. The provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the purposes and policies of the compact.</p>

For purposes of this subsection, evidence is substantial if it would be considered substantial evidence under the model state administrative procedures act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a rule, those states may, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, cause that rule to have no further force and effect in any compacting state.</p>

<p>Any state, the District of Columbia or its designee, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands as defined in Article II of this compact is eligible to become a compacting state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the compact into law by no less than thirty-five of the states. The initial effective date shall be the later of July 1, 2004, or upon enactment into law by the thirty-fifth jurisdiction. Thereafter, it shall become effective and binding as to any other compacting state upon enactment of the compact into law by that state. The governors of nonmember states or their designees shall be invited to participate in the activities of the interstate commission on a nonvoting basis before adoption of the compact by all states and territories of the United States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The interstate commission may propose amendments to the compact for enactment by the compacting states. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the interstate commission and the compacting states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the compacting states.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>ARTICLE XI - Withdrawal, Default, Termination,</p>
<p>and Judicial Enforcement</p>
<p>Section A. Withdrawal</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every compacting state. However, a compacting state may withdraw from the compact by repealing the statute that enacted the compact into law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chair of the interstate commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state. The interstate commission shall notify the other compacting states of the withdrawing state's intent to withdraw within sixty days of its receipt thereof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur upon the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or upon such later date as determined by the interstate commission.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Section B. Technical Assistance, Fines, Suspension,</p>
<p>Termination, and Default</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the interstate commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, or the bylaws or adopted rules, the interstate commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the interstate commission;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternative dispute resolution;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fines, fees, and costs in such amounts as set by the interstate commission; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suspension or termination of membership in the compact, which shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the bylaws and rules have been exhausted and the interstate commission has determined that the offending state is in default. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the interstate commission to the governor, the chief justice or the chief judicial officer of the state, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the state council. The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, the bylaws, or rules and any other grounds designated in commission bylaws and rules. The interstate commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the interstate commission and of the default pending a cure of the default. The commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the commission, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within sixty days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the interstate commission shall notify the governor, the chief justice or chief judicial officer, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the state council of such termination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the interstate commission and the defaulting state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the interstate commission pursuant to the rules.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Section C. Judicial enforcement</p>
<p>The interstate commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the interstate commission, in the federal district where the interstate commission has its offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its rules, and bylaws against any compacting state in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorneys' fees.</p>
<p>Section D. Dissolution of compact</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state, which reduces membership in the compact to one compacting state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the interstate commission shall be concluded and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>ARTICLE XII - Severability and Construction</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The provisions of this compact are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the compact are enforceable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>ARTICLE XIII - Binding Effect of Compact and Other Laws</p>
<p>Section A. Other laws</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section prevents the enforcement of any other law of a compacting state that is consistent with this compact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All compacting states' laws other than state constitutions and other interstate compacts conflicting with this compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Section B. Binding effect of the compact</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>All lawful actions of the interstate commission, including all rules and bylaws adopted by the interstate commission, are binding upon the compacting states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All agreements between the interstate commission and the compacting states are binding in accordance with their terms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon the request of a party to a conflict over meaning or interpretation of interstate commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the compacting states, the interstate commission may issue advisory opinions regarding such meaning or interpretation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the event any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers, or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the interstate commission shall be ineffective and such obligations, duties, powers, or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which such obligations, duties, powers, or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this compact becomes effective.</p>
