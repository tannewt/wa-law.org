A court-martial so convened has jurisdiction to try the dismissed officer on those charges, and the officer shall be considered to have waived the right to plead any statute of limitations applicable to any offense with which the officer is charged. The court-martial may, as part of its sentence, adjudge the affirmance of the dismissal, but if the court-martial acquits the accused or if the sentence adjudged, as finally approved or affirmed, does not include dismissal, the chief of staff to the governor or adjutant general shall substitute for the dismissal ordered by the governor a form of discharge authorized for administrative issue.

3. If a discharge is substituted for a dismissal under this code, the governor alone may reappoint the officer to such commissioned grade and with such rank as, in the opinion of the governor, that former officer would have attained had the officer not been dismissed. The reappointment of such a former officer may be made only if a vacancy is available under applicable tables of organization. All time between the dismissal and the reappointment shall be considered as actual service for all purposes.

4. If an officer is discharged from the organized militia by administrative action or by board proceedings under law, or is dropped from the rolls by order of the governor, the officer has no right to trial under this section.

\[ [1989 c 48 § 13](http://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1989c48.pdf?cite=1989%20c%2048%20§%2013); [1963 c 220 § 13](http://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1963c220.pdf?cite=1963%20c%20220%20§%2013); \]

## 38.38.132 - [Art. 15] Commanding officer's nonjudicial punishment—Suspension—Appeal.
1. Under such regulations as the governor may prescribe, limitations may be placed on the powers granted by this section with respect to the kind and amount of punishment authorized, the categories of commanding officers and warrant officers exercising command authorized to exercise those powers, the applicability of this section to an accused who demands trial by court-martial, and the kinds of courts-martial to which the case may be referred upon such a demand. However, except in the case of a member attached to or embarked in a vessel, punishment may not be imposed upon any member of the organized militia under this section if the member has, before the imposition of such punishment, demanded trial by court-martial in lieu of such punishment. Under similar regulations, rules may be prescribed with respect to the suspension of punishments authorized hereunder. If authorized by regulations of the governor, a commanding officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction or an officer of general rank in command may delegate powers under this section to a principal assistant.

2. Subject to subsection (1) of this section, any commanding officer may, in addition to or in lieu of admonition or reprimand, impose one or more of the following disciplinary punishments for minor offenses without the intervention of a court-martial:

   a. Upon officers of his or her command:

      i. Restriction to certain specified limits, with or without suspension from duty, for not more than fourteen consecutive duty or drill days;

      ii. If imposed by an officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction or an officer of general rank in command:

          A.  Forfeiture of up to thirty days' pay, but not more than fifteen days' pay per month;

          B.  Restriction to certain specified limits, with or without suspension from duty, for not more than fourteen consecutive drill or duty days;

          C.  Detention of up to forty-five days' pay, but not more than fifteen days' pay per month;

   b. Upon other personnel of his or her command:

      i. If imposed upon a person attached to or embarked in a vessel, confinement for not more than three consecutive days;

      ii. Forfeiture of not more than seven days' pay;

      iii. Reduction to the next inferior pay grade, if the grade from which demoted is within the promotion authority of the officer imposing the reduction or any officer subordinate to the one who imposes the reduction;

      iv. Extra duties, including fatigue or other duties for not more than fourteen duty or drill days, which need not be consecutive, and for not more than two hours per day, holidays included;

      v. Restriction to certain specified limits, with or without suspension from duty, for not more than fourteen consecutive days;

      vi. Detention of not more than fourteen days' pay;

      vii. If imposed by a commanding officer of the grade of major or above:

           A.  The punishment authorized in subsection (2)(b)(i) of this section;

           B.  Forfeiture of up to thirty days' pay, but not more than fifteen days' pay per month;

           C.  Reduction to the lowest or any intermediate pay grade, if the grade from which demoted is within the promotion authority of the officer imposing the reduction or any officer subordinate to the one who imposes the reduction, but an enlisted member in a pay grade above E-4 may not be reduced more than two pay grades;

           D.  Extra duties, including fatigue or other duties, for not more than fourteen drill or duty days, which need not be consecutive, and for not more than two hours per day, holidays included;

           E.  Restriction to certain specified limits, with or without suspension from duty, for not more than fourteen consecutive days;

           F.  Detention of up to forty-five days' pay, but not more than fifteen days' pay per month.

Detention of pay shall be for a stated period of not more than one year but if the offender's term of service expires earlier, the detention shall terminate upon that expiration. Extra duties and restriction may not be combined to run consecutively in the maximum amount imposable for each. Whenever any such punishments are combined to run consecutively, there must be an apportionment. In addition, forfeiture of pay may not be combined with detention of pay without an apportionment.

3. An officer in charge may impose upon enlisted members assigned to the unit of which the officer is in charge such of the punishment authorized under subsection (2)(b) of this section as the governor may specifically prescribe by regulation.

4. The officer who imposes the punishment authorized in subsection (2) of this section, or a successor in command, may, at any time, suspend probationally any part or amount of the unexecuted punishment imposed and may suspend probationally a reduction in grade or a forfeiture imposed under subsection (2) of this section, whether or not executed. In addition, the officer may, at any time, remit or mitigate any part or amount of the unexecuted punishment imposed and may set aside in whole or in part the punishment, whether executed or unexecuted, and restore all rights, privileges, and property affected. The officer may also mitigate reduction in grade to forfeiture or detention of pay. When mitigating extra duties to restriction, the restriction shall not be longer than the number of hours of extra duty that may have been imposed. When mitigating reduction in grade to forfeiture or detention of pay, the amount of the forfeiture or detention shall not be greater than the amount that could have been imposed initially under this section by the officer who imposed the punishment mitigated.

5. A person punished under this section who considers the punishment unjust or disproportionate to the offense may, through the proper channel, appeal to the next superior authority. The appeal shall be promptly forwarded and decided, but the person punished may in the meantime be required to undergo the punishment adjudged. The superior authority may exercise the same powers with respect to the punishment imposed as may be exercised under subsection (4) of this section by the officer who imposed the punishment. Before acting on an appeal from a punishment of:

   a. Forfeiture of more than seven days' pay;

   b. Reduction of one or more pay grades from the fourth or a higher pay grade;

   c. Extra duties for more than ten days;

   d. Restriction for more than ten days; or

   e. Detention of more than fourteen days' pay;

the authority who is to act on the appeal shall refer the case to a judge advocate for consideration and advice, and may so refer the case upon appeal from any punishment imposed under subsection (2) of this section.

6. The imposition and enforcement of disciplinary punishment under this section for any act or omission is not a bar to trial by court-martial for a serious crime or offense growing out of the same act or omission, and not properly punishable under this section; but the fact that a disciplinary punishment has been enforced may be shown by the accused upon trial, and when so shown shall be considered in determining the measure of punishment to be adjudged in the event of a finding of guilty.

7. The governor may by regulation prescribe the form of records to be kept of proceedings under this section and may also prescribe that certain categories of those proceedings shall be in writing.

## 38.38.316 - [Art. 32] Investigation.

   c. Is afforded the opportunities for representation, cross-examination, and presentation prescribed in subsection (2) of this section.

The foregoing provisions of this section shall not apply with respect to (a) general instructional or informational courses in military justice if such courses are designed solely for the purpose of instructing members of a command in the substantive and procedural aspects of courts-martial, or (b) to statements and instructions given in open court by the military judge, president of a special court-martial, or counsel.

2. In the preparation of an effectiveness, fitness, or efficiency report or any other report or document used in whole or in part for the purpose of determining whether a member of the organized militia is qualified to be advanced, in grade, or in determining the assignment or transfer of a member of the organized militia, or in determining whether a member of the organized militia should be retained on active duty, no person subject to this chapter may, in preparing any such report (a) consider or evaluate the performance of duty of any such member of a court-martial, or (b) give a less favorable rating or evaluation of any member of the organized militia because of the zeal with which such member, as counsel, represented any accused before a court-martial.

Challenges by the trial counsel shall ordinarily be presented and decided before those by the accused are offered.

2.

2. With respect to any other charge or specification to which a plea of guilty has been made by the accused and accepted by the military judge or by a court-martial without a military judge, a finding of guilty of the charge or specification may be entered immediately without vote. This finding shall constitute the finding of the court unless the plea of guilty is withdrawn prior to announcement of the sentence, in which event the proceedings shall continue as though the accused had pleaded not guilty.

   b. That the witness by reason of death, age, sickness, bodily infirmity, imprisonment, military necessity, nonamenability to process, or other reasonable cause, is unable or refuses to appear and testify in person at the place of trial or hearing; or

3. Such testimony may also be read in evidence before a court of inquiry or a military board.

## 38.38.428 - [Art. 51] Voting, rulings, instructions.
1. Voting by members of a general or special court-martial on the findings and on the sentence, and by members of a court-martial without a military judge upon questions of challenge, shall be by secret written ballot. The junior member of the court shall count the votes. The count shall be checked by the president, who shall forthwith announce the result of the ballot to the members of the court.

2. The military judge and, except for questions of challenge, the president of a court-martial without a military judge shall rule upon all questions of law and all interlocutory questions arising during the proceedings. Any such ruling made by the military judge upon any question of law or any interlocutory question other than the factual issue of mental responsibility of the accused, or by the president of a court-martial without a military judge upon any question of law other than a motion for a finding of not guilty, is final and constitutes the ruling of the court. However, the military judge or the president of a court-martial without a military judge may change a ruling at any time during the trial. Unless the ruling is final, if any member objects thereto, the court shall be cleared and closed and the question decided by a vote as provided in RCW 38.38.432, beginning with the junior in rank.

3. Before a vote is taken on the findings, the military judge or the president of a court-martial without a military judge shall, in the presence of the accused and counsel, instruct the members of the court as to the elements of the offense and charge them:

   a. That the accused must be presumed to be innocent until guilt is established by legal and competent evidence beyond reasonable doubt;

   b. That in the case being considered, if there is reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the accused and the accused must be acquitted;

   c. That, if there is a reasonable doubt as to the degree of guilt, the finding must be in a lower degree to which there is no reasonable doubt; and

   d. That the burden of proof to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt is upon the state.

4. Subsections (1), (2), and (3) of this section do not apply to a court-martial composed of a military judge only. The military judge of such a court-martial shall determine all questions of law and fact arising during the proceedings and, if the accused is convicted, adjudge an appropriate sentence. The military judge of such a court-martial shall make a general finding and shall in addition on request find the facts specially. If an opinion or memorandum of decision is filed, it will be sufficient if the findings of fact appear therein.

\[ [1989 c 48 § 48](http://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1989c48.pdf?cite=1989%20c%2048%20§%2048); [1963 c 220 § 53](http://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1963c220.pdf?cite=1963%20c%20220%20§%2053); \]

## 38.38.432 - [Art. 52] Number of votes required.
1. No person may be convicted of an offense, except as provided in RCW 38.38.404(2) or by the concurrence of two-thirds of the members present at the time the vote is taken.

2. All sentences shall be determined by the concurrence of two-thirds of the members present at the time that the vote is taken.

3. All other questions to be decided by the members of a general or special court-martial shall be determined by a majority vote, but a determination to reconsider a finding of guilty, or to reconsider a sentence with a view towards decreasing it, may be made by any lesser vote which indicates that the reconsideration is not opposed by the number of votes required for that finding or sentence. A tie vote on a challenge disqualifies the member challenged. A tie vote on a motion for a finding of not guilty or on a motion relating to the question of the accused's sanity is a determination against the accused. A tie vote on any other question is a determination in favor of the accused.

\[ [1989 c 48 § 49](http://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1989c48.pdf?cite=1989%20c%2048%20§%2049); [1963 c 220 § 54](http://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1963c220.pdf?cite=1963%20c%20220%20§%2054); \]

## 38.38.440 - [Art. 54] Record of trial.
1. Each general court-martial shall keep a separate record of the proceedings in each case brought before it, and the record shall be authenticated by the signature of the military judge.

2. Each rehearing shall take place before a court martial composed of members not members of the court martial which first heard the case. Upon a rehearing the accused may not be tried for any offense of which he or she was found not guilty by the first court martial, and no sentence in excess of or more severe than the original sentence may be imposed, unless the sentence is based upon a finding of guilty of an offense not considered upon the merits in the original proceedings, or unless the sentence prescribed for the offense is mandatory.

The record and the opinion of the staff judge advocate shall then be sent to the state judge advocate for review.

In considering the record, the state judge advocate may weigh the evidence, judge the credibility of witnesses, and determine controverted questions of fact, recognizing that the trial court saw and heard the witnesses. If the state judge advocate sets aside the findings and sentence, the state judge advocate may, except where the setting aside is based on lack of sufficient evidence in the record to support the findings, order a rehearing. If the state judge advocate sets aside the findings and sentence and does not order a rehearing, he or she shall order that the charges be dismissed.

7. In a case reviewable by the state judge advocate under this section, the state judge advocate shall instruct the convening authority to act in accordance with the state judge advocate's decision on the review.

Each board of review shall review the record of any trial by special court-martial, including a sentence to a dishonorable discharge, referred to it by the state judge advocate. Boards of review have the same authority on review as the state judge advocate has under this section.
