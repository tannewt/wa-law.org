<p>This chapter is intended to provide the exclusive source of local government entity authority to individually or jointly self-insure risks, jointly purchase insurance or reinsurance, and to contract for risk management, claims, and administrative services. This chapter shall be liberally construed to grant local government entities maximum flexibility in self-insuring to the extent the self-insurance programs are operated in a safe and sound manner. This chapter is intended to require prior approval for the establishment of every individual local government self-insured employee health and welfare benefit program and every joint local government self-insurance program. In addition, this chapter is intended to require every local government entity that establishes a self-insurance program not subject to prior approval to notify the state of the existence of the program and to comply with the regulatory and statutory standards governing the management and operation of the programs as provided in this chapter. This chapter is not intended to authorize or regulate self-insurance of unemployment compensation under chapter 50.44 RCW, or industrial insurance under chapter 51.14 RCW.</p>

<li>
<p>This chapter is further intended to enable the board of pilotage commissioners to participate in a local government joint self-insurance program covering liability risks.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Every individual and joint self-insurance program is subject to audit by the state auditor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If provided for in the agreement or contract established under chapter 39.34 RCW, a joint self-insurance program may, in conformance with this chapter:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Contract or otherwise provide legal counsel for the defense of claims and other legal services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consult with the state insurance commissioner and the state risk manager;</p>

<p>Within one hundred twenty days of receipt of a plan of management and operation, the state risk manager shall either approve or disapprove the formation of the self-insurance program after reviewing the plan to determine whether the proposed program complies with this chapter and all rules adopted in accordance with this chapter.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever the state risk manager determines that a joint self-insurance program covering property or liability risks or an individual or joint self-insured health and welfare benefits program is in violation of this chapter or is operating in an unsafe financial condition, the state risk manager may issue and serve upon the program an order to cease and desist from the violation or practice.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>After hearing or with the consent of a program governed by this chapter and in addition to or in lieu of a continuation of the cease and desist order, the risk manager may levy a fine upon the program in an amount not less than three hundred dollars and not more than ten thousand dollars. The order levying such fine shall specify the period within which the fine shall be fully paid. The period within which such fines shall be paid shall not be less than fifteen nor more than thirty days from the date of such order. Upon failure to pay any such fine when due the risk manager shall request the attorney general to bring a civil action on the risk manager's behalf to collect the fine. The risk manager shall pay any fine so collected to the state treasurer for the account of the general fund.</p>

<p>No self-insurance program requiring the state risk manager's approval may engage in an act or practice that in any respect significantly differs from the management and operation plan that formed the basis for the state risk manager's approval of the program unless the program first notifies the state risk manager in writing and obtains the state risk manager's approval. The state risk manager shall approve or disapprove the proposed change within sixty days of receipt of the notice. If the state risk manager denies a requested change, the risk manager shall specify in detail the reasons for denial and the manner in which the program would fail to meet the requirements of this chapter or any rules adopted in accordance with this chapter.</p>
