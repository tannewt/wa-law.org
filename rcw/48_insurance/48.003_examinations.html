<ol>
<li>
<p>The commissioner shall examine the affairs, transactions, accounts, records, documents, and assets of each authorized insurer as often as he or she deems advisable. The commissioner shall so examine each insurer holding a certificate of authority or certificate of registration not less frequently than every five years. Examination of an alien insurer may be limited to its insurance transactions in the United States. In scheduling and determining the nature, scope, and frequency of an examination, the commissioner shall consider such matters as the results of financial statement analyses and ratios, changes in management or ownership, actuarial opinions, reports of independent certified public accountants, and other criteria as set forth in the examiner's handbook adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and in effect when the commissioner exercises discretion under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As often as the commissioner deems advisable and at least once in five years, the commissioner shall fully examine each rating organization and examining bureau licensed in this state. As often as he or she deems it advisable the commissioner may examine each advisory organization, any statistical reporting agent designated by the commissioner under RCW 48.29.017, and each joint underwriting or joint reinsurance group, association, or organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commissioner shall in like manner examine each insurer or rating organization applying for authority to do business in this state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In lieu of making an examination under this chapter, the commissioner may accept a full report of the last recent examination of a nondomestic rating or advisory organization, or joint underwriting or joint reinsurance group, association or organization, as prepared by the insurance supervisory official of the state of domicile or of entry. In lieu of an examination under this chapter of a foreign or alien insurer licensed in this state, the commissioner may accept an examination report on the company as prepared by the insurance department for the company's state of domicile or port-of-entry state until January 1, 1994. Thereafter, an examination report may be accepted only if: (a) That insurance department was at the time of the examination accredited under the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' financial regulation standards and accreditation program; or (b) the examination was performed either under the supervision of an accredited insurance department or with the participation of one or more examiners employed by an accredited state insurance department who, after a review of the examination work papers and report, state under oath that the examination was performed in a manner consistent with the standards and procedures required by their insurance department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commissioner may elect to accept and rely on an audit report made by an independent certified public accountant for the insurer in the course of that part of the commissioner's examination covering the same general subject matter as the audit. The commissioner may incorporate the audit report in his or her report of the examination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of completing an examination of any company under this chapter, the commissioner may examine or investigate any managing general agent or any other person, or the business of any managing general agent or other person, insofar as that examination or investigation is, in the sole discretion of the commissioner, necessary or material to the examination of the company.</p>

<li>
<p>Any insurance producer, surplus line broker, adjuster, or title insurance agent.</p>

<li>
