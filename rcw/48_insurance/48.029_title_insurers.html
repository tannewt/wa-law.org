<p>In determining the financial condition of a title insurer doing business under this title, the general provisions of chapter 48.12 RCW requiring the establishment of reserves sufficient to cover all known and unknown liabilities including allocated and unallocated loss adjustment expense apply, except that a title insurer shall establish and maintain:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A known claim reserve in an amount estimated to be sufficient to cover all unpaid losses, claims, and allocated loss adjustment expenses arising under title insurance policies, guaranteed certificates of title, guaranteed searches, and guaranteed abstracts of title, and all unpaid losses, claims, and allocated loss adjustment expenses for which the title insurer may be liable, and for which the insurer has received notice by or on behalf of the insured, holder of a guarantee or escrow, or security depositor;</p>
</li>
<li>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A statutory or unearned premium reserve consisting of:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The amount of the special reserve fund that was required prior to July 24, 2005, which balance must be released in accordance with (b) of this subsection; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additions to the reserve after July 24, 2005, must be made out of total charges for title insurance policies and guarantees written, as set forth in the title insurer's most recent annual statement on file with the commissioner, equal to the sum of the following:</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>
<p>For each title insurance policy on a single risk written or assumed after July 24, 2005, fifteen cents per one thousand dollars of net retained liability for policies under five hundred thousand dollars; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each title insurance policy on a single risk written or assumed after July 24, 2005, ten cents per one thousand dollars of net retained liability for policies of five hundred thousand or greater.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The aggregate of the amounts set aside in this reserve in any calendar year pursuant to (a) of this subsection must be released from the reserve and restored to net profits over a period of twenty years under the following formula:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Thirty-five percent of the aggregate sum on July 1st of the year next succeeding the year of addition;</p>

<p>Three percent of the aggregate sum on July 1st of each of the next three succeeding years;</p>

<p>Two percent of the aggregate sum on July 1st of each of the next three succeeding years; and</p>

<li>
<p>One percent of the aggregate sum on July 1st of each of the next succeeding ten years.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The insurer shall calculate an adjusted statutory unearned premium reserve as of July 24, 2005. The adjusted reserve is calculated as if (a)(ii) and (b) of this subsection had been in effect for all years beginning twenty years prior to July 24, 2005. For purposes of this calculation, the balance of the reserve as of that date is deemed to be zero. If the adjusted reserve so calculated exceeds the aggregate amount set aside for statutory or unearned premiums in the insurer's annual statement on file with the commissioner on July 24, 2005, the insurer shall, out of total charges for policies of title insurance, increase its statutory or unearned premium reserve by an amount equal to one-sixth of that excess in each of the succeeding six years, commencing with the calendar year that includes July 24, 2005, until the entire excess has been added.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The aggregate of the amounts set aside in this reserve in any calendar year as adjustments to the insurer's statutory or unearned premium reserve under (c) of this subsection shall be released from the reserve and restored to net profits, or equity if the additions required by (c) of this subsection reduced equity directly, over a period not exceeding ten years under to the [under the] following table:</p>

The cancellation shall be effective thirty days after the notice is received by the commissioner. Whether or not the bond is renewed, continued, reinstated, reissued, or otherwise extended, replaced, or modified, including increases or decreases in the penal sum, it shall be considered one continuous obligation, and the surety upon the bond shall not be liable in an aggregate amount exceeding the penal sum set forth on the face of the bond.

The insurance shall provide coverage for any fraudulent or dishonest acts committed by any one or more of the employees, officers, or owners as defined in the policy of insurance, acting alone or in collusion with others. The insurance shall be for the sole benefit of the title insurance agent and under no circumstances whatsoever shall the insurance company be liable under the insurance to any other party.

<p>The fidelity bond or fidelity insurance, and the surety bond or other form of security approved by the commissioner, shall be kept in full force and effect as a condition precedent to the title insurance agent's authority to transact business in this state, and the title insurance agent shall supply the commissioner with satisfactory evidence thereof upon request.</p>

<li>
<p>A title insurance company authorized to do business in Washington under RCW 48.05.030 may provide a guarantee in a form satisfactory to the commissioner accepting financial responsibility, up to the aggregate amount of two hundred thousand dollars, for any fraudulent or dishonest acts committed by any one or more of the employees, officers, or owners of a title insurance agent that is appointed as the title insurance company's agent. A title insurance company providing a guarantee as permitted under this subsection may only do so on behalf of its properly appointed title insurance agents. If the title insurance agent is an agent for two or more title insurance companies, any liability under the guarantee shall be borne by the title insurance company for those escrows for which a title insurance commitment or policy was issued on behalf of that title insurance company. If no commitment or policy was issued regarding the escrow for which moneys were lost, including but not limited to collection escrows, each title insurance company, for which the agent was appointed at the time of the fraudulent or dishonest act, shares in the liability. The liability will be shared proportionally, as follows: The premium the agent remitted to the title insurance company in the year prior to the fraudulent or dishonest act will be compared to the total premium the agent remitted to all title insurance companies, for whom the title insurance agent was appointed, during the same period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All title insurance agents licensed on or before July 24, 2005, shall comply with this section within thirty days following July 24, 2005.</p>
