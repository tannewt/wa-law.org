<p>Any person may be indemnified and reimbursed by any society for expenses reasonably incurred by, and liabilities imposed upon, the person in connection with or arising out of any action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, or threat thereof, in which the person may be involved by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the society or of any firm, corporation, or organization which the person served in any capacity at the request of the society. A person shall not be so indemnified or reimbursed (a) in relation to any matter in such action, suit, or proceeding as to which the person shall finally be adjudged to be or have been guilty of breach of a duty as a director, officer, employee, or agent of the society; or (b) in relation to any matter in the action, suit, or proceeding, or threat thereof, which has been made the subject of a compromise settlement; unless in either case the person acted in good faith for a purpose the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the society and, in a criminal action or proceeding, in addition, had no reasonable cause to believe that their conduct was unlawful.

The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of no contest, as to the person shall not in itself create a conclusive presumption that the person did not meet the standard of conduct required in order to justify indemnification and reimbursement.
