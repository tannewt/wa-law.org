<ol>
<li>
<p>Documents, materials, or other information that the commissioner obtains under this chapter in the commissioner's capacity as a receiver, are records under the jurisdiction and control of the receivership court. These records are confidential by law and privileged, are not subject to chapter 42.56 or 40.14 RCW, and are not subject to subpoena directed to the commissioner or any person who received documents, materials, or other information while acting under the authority of the commissioner. The commissioner is authorized to use such documents, materials, or other information in the furtherance of any regulatory or legal action brought as a part of the commissioner's official duties. The confidentiality and privilege created by this section and RCW 42.56.400(17) is not waived if confidential and privileged information under this section is shared with any person acting under the authority of the commissioner, representatives of insurance guaranty associations that may have statutory obligations as a result of the insolvency of an insurer, the national association of insurance commissioners and its affiliates and subsidiaries, regulatory and law enforcement officials of other states and nations, the federal government, and international authorities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neither the commissioner nor any person who received documents, materials, or other information while acting under the authority of the commissioner as receiver is required to testify in any private civil action concerning any confidential and privileged documents, materials, or information subject to subsection (1) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any person who can demonstrate a legal interest in the receivership estate or a reasonable suspicion of negligence or malfeasance by the commissioner related to an insurer receivership may file a motion in the receivership matter to allow inspection of private company information or documents not subject to public disclosure under subsection (1) of this section. The court shall conduct an in-camera review after notifying the commissioner and every party that produced the information. The court may order the commissioner to allow the petitioner to have access to the information, provided the petitioner maintains the confidentiality of the information. The petitioner must not disclose the information to any other person, except upon further order of the court. After conducting a hearing, the court may order that the information can be disclosed if the court finds that there is a public interest in the disclosure of the information and the protection of the information from public disclosure is clearly unnecessary to protect any individual's right of privacy, or any company's proprietary information, and the commissioner has not demonstrated that the disclosure would impair any vital governmental function, the receivership estate, or the receiver's ability to manage the estate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The confidentiality and privilege of documents, materials or other information obtained by the receiver set forth in subsections (1) and (2) of this section does not apply to litigation to which the insurer in receivership is a party. In such instances, discovery is governed by the Washington rules of civil procedure.</p>

<p>Whenever under the laws of this state a receiver is to be appointed in delinquency proceedings for an insurer domiciled in this state, the court shall appoint the commissioner as such receiver. The court shall direct the commissioner forthwith to take possession of the assets of the insurer and to administer the same under the orders of the court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As domiciliary receiver the commissioner shall be vested by operation of law with the title to all of the property, contracts, and rights of action, and all of the books and records of the insurer wherever located, as of the date of entry of the order directing him or her to rehabilitate or liquidate a domestic insurer, or to liquidate the United States branch of an alien insurer domiciled in this state, and he or she shall have the right to recover the same and reduce the same to possession; except that ancillary receivers in reciprocal states shall have, as to assets located in their respective states, the rights and powers which are hereinafter prescribed for ancillary receivers appointed in this state as to assets located in this state.</p>

<li>
<p>The filing or recording of the order directing possession to be taken, or a certified copy thereof, in the office where instruments affecting title to property are required to be filed or recorded shall impart the same notice as would be imparted by a deed, bill of sale, or other evidence of title duly filed or recorded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commissioner as domiciliary receiver shall be responsible on his or her official bond for the proper administration of all assets coming into his or her possession or control.

<p>Upon taking possession of the assets of an insurer the domiciliary receiver shall, subject to the direction of the court, immediately proceed to conduct the business of the insurer or to take such steps as are authorized by the laws of this state for the purpose of liquidating, rehabilitating, reorganizing, or conserving the affairs of the insurer.</p>

<li>
<p>In connection with delinquency proceedings the commissioner may appoint one or more special deputy commissioners to act for him or her, and may employ such counsel, clerks, and assistants as he or she deems necessary. The compensation of the special deputies, counsel, clerks, or assistants and all expenses of taking possession of the insurer and of conducting the proceedings shall be fixed by the receiver, subject to the approval of the court, and shall be paid out of the funds or assets of the insurer. Within the limits of the duties imposed upon them special deputies shall possess all the powers given to, and, in the exercise of those powers, shall be subject to all of the duties imposed upon the receiver with respect to such proceedings.</p>

<p>Whenever under the laws of this state an ancillary receiver is to be appointed in delinquency proceedings for an insurer not domiciled in this state, the court shall appoint the commissioner as ancillary receiver. The commissioner shall file a petition requesting the appointment (a) if he or she finds that there are sufficient assets of such insurer located in this state to justify the appointment of an ancillary receiver, or (b) if ten or more persons resident in this state having claims against such insurer file a petition with the commissioner requesting the appointment of such ancillary receiver.</p>

<p>The domiciliary receiver for the purpose of liquidating an insurer domiciled in a reciprocal state, shall be vested by operation of law with the title to all of the property, contracts, and rights of action, and all of the books and records of the insurer located in this state, and he or she shall have the immediate right to recover balances due from local insurance producers and surplus line brokers and to obtain possession of any books and records of the insurer found in this state. He or she shall also be entitled to recover the other assets of the insurer located in this state except that upon the appointment of an ancillary receiver in this state, the ancillary receiver shall during the ancillary receivership proceedings have the sole right to recover such other assets. The ancillary receiver shall, as soon as practicable, liquidate from their respective securities those special deposit claims and secured claims which are proved and allowed in the ancillary proceedings in this state, and shall pay the necessary expenses of the proceedings. All remaining assets shall promptly transfer to the domiciliary receiver. Subject to the foregoing provisions the ancillary receiver and his or her deputies shall have the same powers and be subject to the same duties with respect to the administration of such assets, as a receiver of an insurer domiciled in this state.</p>
