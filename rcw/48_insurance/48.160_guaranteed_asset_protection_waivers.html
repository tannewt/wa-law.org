<li>
<p>This chapter applies only to guaranteed asset protection waivers for financing of motor vehicles as defined in this chapter. Any person or entity must register with the commissioner before marketing, offering for sale or selling a guaranteed asset protection waiver, and before acting as an obligor for a guaranteed asset protection waiver, in this state. However, a retail seller of motor vehicles that assigns more than eighty-five percent of guaranteed asset protection waiver agreements within thirty days of such agreements' effective date, or an insurer authorized to transact such insurance business in this state, are not required to register pursuant to this section. Failure of any retail seller of motor vehicles to assign one hundred percent of guaranteed asset protection waiver agreements within forty-five days of such agreements' effective date will result in that retail seller being required to comply with the registration requirements of this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No person may market, offer for sale, or sell a guaranteed asset protection waiver, or act as an obligor on a guaranteed asset protection waiver in this state without a registration as provided in this chapter, except as set forth in subsection (1) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application for registration must include the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The applicant's name, address, and telephone number;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The identities of the applicant's executive officers or other officers directly responsible for the waiver business;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An application fee of two hundred fifty dollars, which shall be deposited into the guaranteed asset protection waiver account;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A copy filed by the applicant with the commissioner of the waivers the applicant intends to offer in this state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A list of all unregistered marketers of guaranteed asset protection waivers on which the applicant will be the obligor;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such additional information as the commissioner may reasonably require.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once registered, the applicant shall keep the information required for registration current by reporting changes within thirty days after the end of the month in which the change occurs.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Waivers may be offered, sold, or provided to borrowers in this state in compliance with this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Waivers may, at the option of the creditor, be sold for a single payment or may be offered with a monthly or periodic payment option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any cost to the borrower for a guaranteed asset protection waiver entered into in compliance with the truth in lending act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 1601 et seq.) and its implementing regulations, as amended, must be separately stated and is not to be considered a finance charge or interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this chapter prohibits a person who is registered, or is otherwise exempt from registration or exempt from this chapter, from insuring its waiver obligation through the purchase of a contractual liability policy or other insurance policy issued by an insurer authorized to transact such insurance in this state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The waiver remains a part of the finance agreement upon the assignment, sale, or transfer of the finance agreement by the creditor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neither the extension of credit, the term of credit, nor the term of the related motor vehicle sale or lease may be conditioned upon the purchase of a waiver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any creditor that offers a waiver must report the sale of, and forward funds received on, all waivers to the designated party, if any, as prescribed in any applicable administrative services agreement, contractual liability policy, other insurance policy, or other specified program documents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Funds received or held by a creditor or administrator and belonging to an insurer, creditor, or administrator, under the terms of a written agreement, must be held by that creditor or administrator in a fiduciary capacity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the guaranteed asset protection waiver is assigned, the name and address of the assignee must be mailed to the borrower within thirty days of the assignment. If at any time the name and address provided to the borrower by the initial creditor are no longer the valid point of contact to apply for waiver benefits, written notice will be mailed to the borrower within thirty days of the change stating the new name and address of the person or entity the borrower should contact to apply for waiver benefits. No waiver may be assigned to an entity that is not registered pursuant to this chapter, unless such entity is exempt from registration or unless the commissioner specifically authorizes such assignment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No person shall knowingly make, publish, or disseminate any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or advertising in the conduct of, or relative to, waiver business. Nor shall any person make, issue, or circulate, or cause to be made, issued, or circulated any misrepresentation of the terms or benefits of any waiver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person or entity engaged in the guaranteed asset protection waiver business in this state may not refuse to sell or issue any guaranteed asset protection waiver because of the sex, marital status, or sexual orientation as defined in RCW 49.60.040, or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability of the borrower or prospective borrower. The type of benefits, or any term, rate, condition, or type of coverage may not be restricted, modified, excluded, increased, or reduced on the basis of the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability of the borrower or prospective borrower.</p>

<p>Contractual liability or other insurance policies insuring waivers must state the obligation of the insurer to reimburse or pay to the creditor any sums the creditor is legally obligated to waive under the waivers issued by the creditor and purchased or held by the borrower. Contractual liability insurance or other insurance policies insuring waivers must not be purchased by the creditor as part of, or a rider to, vendor single-interest or collateral protection coverages as defined in RCW 48.22.110(4).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coverage under a contractual liability or other insurance policy insuring a waiver must also cover any subsequent assignee upon the assignment, sale, or transfer of the finance agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coverage under a contractual liability or other insurance policy insuring a waiver must remain in effect unless canceled or terminated in compliance with applicable insurance laws of this state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cancellation or termination of a contractual liability or other insurance policy must not reduce the insurer's responsibility for waivers issued by the creditor prior to the date of cancellation or termination and for which a premium has been received by the insurer.</p>

<p>Guaranteed asset protection waivers must disclose, as applicable, in writing and in clear, understandable language that is easy to read, the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The name and address of the initial creditor and the borrower at the time of sale, and the identity of any administrator if different from the creditor;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purchase price and the terms of the waiver, including without limitation, the requirements for protection, conditions, or exclusions associated with the waiver;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the borrower may cancel the waiver within a free look period as specified in the waiver, and will be entitled to a full refund of the purchase price, so long as no benefits have been provided; or in the event benefits have been provided, the borrower may receive a full or partial refund pursuant to the terms of the waiver;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The procedure the borrower must follow, if any, to obtain waiver benefits under the terms and conditions of the waiver, including a telephone number and address where the borrower may apply for waiver benefits;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether or not the waiver is cancellable after the free look period and the conditions under which it may be canceled or terminated including the procedures for requesting any refund due;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That in order to receive any refund due in the event of a borrower's cancellation of the waiver agreement or early termination of the finance agreement after the free look period of the waiver, the borrower, in accordance with terms of the waiver, must provide a written request to cancel to the creditor, administrator, or such other party, within ninety days of the occurrence of the event terminating the finance agreement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The methodology for calculating any refund of the unearned purchase price of the waiver due, in the event of cancellation of the waiver or early termination of the finance agreement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That any refund of the purchase price for a waiver that was included in the financing of the motor vehicle or vessel may be applied by the creditor as a reduction of the overall amount owed under the finance agreement, rather than applying the refund strictly to the purchase price of the waiver. This disclosure must be conspicuously presented prior to the purchase of the waiver;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That neither the extension of credit, the terms of the credit, nor the terms of the related motor vehicle sale or lease , may be conditioned upon the purchase of the waiver;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the guaranteed asset protection waiver is not credit insurance, nor does it eliminate the borrower's obligation to insure the motor vehicle as provided by laws of this state. Purchasing a guaranteed asset protection waiver does not eliminate the borrower's rights and obligations under the vendor single-interest and collateral protection coverage laws of this state.</p>

<li>
<p>Guaranteed asset protection waiver agreements may be cancellable or noncancellable after the free look period. Waivers must provide that if a borrower cancels a waiver within the free look period, the borrower will be entitled to a full refund of the purchase price, so long as no benefits have been provided; or in the event benefits have been provided, the borrower may receive a full or partial refund pursuant to the terms of the waiver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the event of a borrower's cancellation of the waiver or early termination of the finance agreement, after the agreement has been in effect beyond the free look period, the borrower may be entitled to a refund of any unearned portion of the purchase price of the waiver unless the waiver provides otherwise. In order to receive a refund, the borrower, in accordance with any applicable terms of the waiver, must provide a written request to the creditor, administrator, or other party, within ninety days of the event terminating the finance agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the cancellation of a waiver occurs as a result of a default under the finance agreement or the repossession of the motor vehicle associated with the finance agreement, any refund due may be paid directly to the creditor or administrator and applied as set forth in subsection (4) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any cancellation refund under this section may be applied by the creditor as a reduction of the overall amount owed under the finance agreement, if the cost of the guaranteed asset protection waiver was included in the financing of the motor vehicle or vessel.</p>
