<p>The purpose of this chapter is to establish a framework for the commissioner's market conduct actions, including:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Processes and systems for identifying, assessing, and prioritizing market conduct problems that have a substantial adverse impact on consumers, policyholders, and claimants;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Market conduct actions by the commissioner to substantiate such market conduct problems and a means to remedy significant market conduct problems; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Procedures to communicate and coordinate market conduct actions among state insurance regulators to foster the most efficient and effective use of resources.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that the market analysis or market conduct process utilize available technology in the least intrusive and most cost-efficient manner to develop a baseline understanding of the marketplace and to identify insurers or practices that deviate significantly from the norm or that pose a potential risk to the insurance consumer. It is also the intent of the legislature that this process include discretion for the commissioner to use market conduct examinations when the continuum of available market conduct actions have not sufficiently addressed issues concerning insurer activities in Washington, or when the continuum of available market conduct actions are not reasonably expected to address issues concerning insurer activities in Washington.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is further the intent of the legislature that the commissioner work with the national association of insurance commissioners toward development of an accreditation process for market conduct oversight and an effective process for domestic deference that creates protections for Washington consumers and efficient and effective regulation of the industry.</p>

<p>If the commissioner determines, as a result of market analysis, that further inquiry into a particular insurer or practice is needed, the following continuum of market actions may be considered before conducting a market conduct examination. The commissioner shall not be required to follow the exact sequence of market conduct actions in the continuum or to use all actions in the continuum. As part of the chosen continuum action, the commissioner must discuss with the insurer the data used to choose the option and provide the insurer with an opportunity for data verification at that time. These actions may include, but are not limited to:</p>

The commissioner shall not request insurers to submit data or information provided as part of an insurer's annual financial statement, the annual market conduct statement of the NAIC, or other required schedules, surveys, or reports that are regularly submitted to the commissioner, or with data requests made by other states if that information is available to the commissioner, unless the information is state specific. The commissioner shall coordinate market conduct actions and findings with other state insurance regulators.</p>
