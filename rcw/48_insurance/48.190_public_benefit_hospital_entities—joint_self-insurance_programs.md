## 48.190.005 - Intent.
This chapter is intended to provide authority for two or more public benefit hospital entities to participate in a joint self-insurance program covering property or liability risks. This chapter provides public benefit hospital entities with the exclusive source of authority to jointly self-insure property and liability risks, jointly purchase insurance or reinsurance, and to contract for risk management, claims, and administrative services with other public benefit hospital entities, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. This chapter must be liberally construed to grant public benefit hospital entities maximum flexibility in jointly self-insuring to the extent the self-insurance programs are operated in a safe and sound manner. This chapter is intended to require prior approval for the establishment of every joint self-insurance program. In addition, this chapter is intended to require every joint self-insurance program for public benefit hospital entities established under this chapter to notify the state of the existence of the program and to comply with the regulatory and statutory standards governing the management and operation of the programs as provided in this chapter. This chapter is not intended to authorize or regulate self-insurance of unemployment compensation under chapter 50.44 RCW or industrial insurance under chapter 51.14 RCW.

## 48.190.020 - Formation—Powers—Service of process.
1. The governing body of a public benefit hospital entity may join or form a self-insurance program together with one or more other public benefit hospital entities, and may jointly purchase insurance or reinsurance with one or more other public benefit hospital entities for property and liability risks only as permitted under this chapter. Public benefit hospital entities may contract for or hire personnel to provide risk management, claims, and administrative services in accordance with this chapter.

2. The agreement to form a joint self-insurance program may include the organization of a separate legal or administrative entity with powers delegated to the entity.

3. If provided for in the organizational documents, a joint self-insurance program may, in conformance with this chapter:

    a.  Contract or otherwise provide for risk management and loss control services;

    b.  Contract or otherwise provide legal counsel for the defense of claims and other legal services;

    c.  Consult with the state insurance commissioner and the state risk manager;

    d.  Jointly purchase insurance and reinsurance coverage in a form and amount as provided for in the organizational documents;

    e.  Obligate the program's participants to pledge revenues or contribute money to secure the obligations or pay the expenses of the program, including the establishment of a reserve or fund for coverage; and

    f.  Possess any other powers and perform all other functions reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.

4. Every joint self-insurance program governed by this chapter must appoint the state risk manager as its attorney to receive service of, and upon whom must be served, all legal process issued against the program in this state upon causes of action arising in this state.

    a.  Service upon the state risk manager as attorney constitutes service upon the program. Service upon joint self-insurance programs subject to this chapter may only occur by service upon the state risk manager. At the time of service, the plaintiff shall pay to the state risk manager a fee to be set by the state risk manager, taxable as costs in the action.

    b.  With the initial filing for approval with the state risk manager, each joint self-insurance program must designate by name and address the person to whom the state risk manager must forward legal process that is served upon him or her. The joint self-insurance program may change this person by filing a new designation.

    c.  The appointment of the state risk manager as attorney is irrevocable, binds any successor in interest or to the assets or liabilities of the joint self-insurance program, and remains in effect as long as there is in force in this state any contract made by the joint self-insurance program or liabilities or duties arising from the contract.

    d.  The state risk manager shall keep a record of the day and hour of service upon him or her of all legal process. A copy of the process, by registered mail with return receipt requested, must be sent by the state risk manager to the person designated to receive legal process by the joint self-insurance program in its most recent designation filed with the state risk manager. Proceedings must not commence against the joint self-insurance program, and the program must not be required to appear, plead, or answer, until the expiration of forty days after the date of service upon the state risk manager.

\[ [2017 c 221 § 4](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5581.SL.pdf?cite=2017%20c%20221%20§%204); \]

2. Standards for claims management procedures;

3. Standards for contracts between joint self-insurance programs and private businesses, including standards for contracts between third-party administrators and programs; and

4. Standards that preclude public hospital districts or other public entities participating in the joint self-insurance program from subsidizing, regardless of the form of subsidy, public benefit hospital entities that are not public hospital districts or public entities. These standards do not apply to the consideration attributable to the ownership interest of a public hospital district or other public entity in a separate legal or administrative entity organized with respect to the program.

\[ [2017 c 221 § 5](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5581.SL.pdf?cite=2017%20c%20221%20§%205); \]

## 48.190.050 - State risk manager—Approval of program creation—Required submissions.

1.

The state risk manager shall approve or disapprove the proposed change within sixty days of receipt of the notice. If the state risk manager denies a requested change, the state risk manager shall specify in detail the reasons for the denial and the manner in which the program would fail to meet the requirements of this chapter or any rules adopted in accordance with this chapter.
