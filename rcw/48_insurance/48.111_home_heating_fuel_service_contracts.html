<p>The legislature finds that certain service contracts involving providers of home heating fuel and homeowners are in the public interest. The legislature further finds that the existing statutory provisions regulating service contracts are more burdensome than is necessary to safeguard homeowners from the risk that a contract obligor will close or be unable to fulfill their contract obligations. The legislature declares that it is necessary to establish separate standards that will safeguard certain homeowners from possible losses arising from the cessation of business of a home heating fuel company or the mismanagement of funds paid for home heating fuel service contracts. The purpose of this chapter is to create a legal framework within which home heating fuel service contracts may be sold in this state and set forth requirements for conducting a service contract business.</p>
