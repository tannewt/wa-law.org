<p>The purpose of this subchapter is to protect the interest of insureds, claimants, ceding insurers, assuming insurers, and the public generally. The legislature intends to ensure adequate regulation of insurers and reinsurers and adequate protection for those to whom they owe obligations. Therefore, the legislature provides a mandate that upon the insolvency of a non-United States insurer or reinsurer that provides security to fund its United States obligations in accordance with this subchapter, the assets representing the security must be maintained in the United States and claims must be filed with and valued by the state insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight, and the assets distributed, in accordance with the insurance laws of the state in which the trust is domiciled that are applicable to the liquidation of domestic United States insurance companies. The legislature declares that the matters contained in this subchapter are fundamental to the business of insurance in accordance with 15 U.S.C. Secs. 1011-1012.</p>

The risk assessment may involve an actuarial review, including an independent analysis of reserves and cash flows, and must consider all material risk factors, including when applicable the lines of business involved, the stability of the incurred loss estimates, and the effect of the surplus requirements on the assuming insurer's liquidity or solvency.

<li>
<p>The commissioner must assign a rating to each certified reinsurer, giving due consideration to the financial strength ratings that have been assigned by rating agencies deemed acceptable to the commissioner by rule.

<li>
<p>A certified reinsurer must secure obligations assumed from United States ceding insurers under this section at a level consistent with its rating, as specified in rules adopted by the commissioner.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>In order for a domestic ceding insurer to qualify for full financial statement credit for reinsurance ceded to a certified reinsurer, the certified reinsurer must maintain security in a form acceptable to the commissioner and consistent with the provisions of RCW 48.12.460, or in a multibeneficiary trust in accordance with RCW 48.12.425, except as otherwise provided in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a certified reinsurer maintains a trust to fully secure its obligations under RCW 48.12.425, and chooses to secure its obligations incurred as a certified reinsurer in the form of a multibeneficiary trust, the certified reinsurer must maintain separate trust accounts for its obligations incurred under reinsurance agreements issued or renewed as a certified reinsurer with reduced security as permitted by this section or comparable laws of other United States jurisdictions and for its obligations under RCW 48.12.425. It is a condition to the grant of certification under this section that the certified reinsurer must have bound itself, by the language of the trust and agreement with the commissioner with principal regulatory oversight of each such trust account, to fund, upon termination of any trust account, out of the remaining surplus of the trust any deficiency of any other trust account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The minimum trusteed surplus requirements provided in RCW 48.12.425 are not applicable with respect to a multibeneficiary trust maintained by a certified reinsurer for the purpose of securing obligations incurred under this section, except that the trust must maintain a minimum trusteed surplus of ten million dollars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With respect to obligations incurred by a certified reinsurer under this section, if the security is insufficient, the commissioner must reduce the allowable credit by an amount proportionate to the deficiency, and has the discretion to impose further reductions in allowable credit upon finding that there is a material risk that the certified reinsurer's obligations will not be paid in full when due.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section, a certified reinsurer whose certification has been terminated for any reason must be treated as a certified reinsurer required to secure one hundred percent of its obligations.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>As used in this section, &quot;terminated&quot; means revocation, suspension, voluntary surrender, and inactive status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the commissioner continues to assign a higher rating as permitted by this section, this subsection (5)(e) does not apply to a certified reinsurer in inactive status or to a reinsurer whose certification has been suspended.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an applicant for certification has been certified as a reinsurer in a national association of insurance commissioners accredited jurisdiction, the commissioner has the discretion to defer to that jurisdiction's certification, and has the discretion to defer to the rating assigned by that jurisdiction, and the assuming insurer must be considered to be a certified reinsurer in this state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A certified reinsurer that ceases to assume new business in this state may request to maintain its certification in inactive status in order to continue to qualify for a reduction in security for its in-force business. An inactive certified reinsurer must continue to comply with all applicable requirements of this section, and the commissioner must assign a rating that takes into account, if relevant, the reasons why the reinsurer is not assuming new business.</p>
