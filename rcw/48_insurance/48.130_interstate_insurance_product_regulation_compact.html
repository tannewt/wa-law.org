<li>
<p>Rules and operating procedures shall be made pursuant to a rule-making process that conforms to the model state administrative procedure act of 1981 as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the commission. Before the commission adopts a uniform standard, the commission shall give written notice to the relevant state legislative committees in each compacting state responsible for insurance issues of its intention to adopt the uniform standard. The commission in adopting a uniform standard shall consider fully all submitted materials and issue a concise explanation of its decision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A uniform standard shall become effective ninety days after its adoption by the commission or such later date as the commission may determine. However, a compacting state may opt out of a uniform standard as provided in this section. &quot;Opt out&quot; means any action by a compacting state to decline to adopt or participate in an adopted uniform standard. All other rules and operating procedures, and amendments thereto, shall become effective as of the date specified in each rule, operating procedure, or amendment.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A compacting state may opt out of a uniform standard, either by legislation or regulation adopted by the insurance department under the compacting state's administrative procedure act. If a compacting state elects to opt out of a uniform standard by rule, it must: (i) Give written notice to the commission no later than ten business days after the uniform standard is adopted, or at the time the state becomes a compacting state; and (ii) find that the uniform standard does not provide reasonable protections to the citizens of the state, given the conditions in the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commissioner shall make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law, based on a preponderance of the evidence, detailing the conditions in the state which warrant a departure from the uniform standard and determining that the uniform standard would not reasonably protect the citizens of the state. The commissioner must consider and balance the following factors and find that the conditions in the state and needs of the citizens of the state outweigh: (i) The intent of the legislature to participate in, and the benefits of, an interstate agreement to establish national uniform consumer protections for the products subject to this chapter; and (ii) the presumption that a uniform standard adopted by the commission provides reasonable protections to consumers of the relevant product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A compacting state may, at the time of its enactment of the compact, prospectively opt out of all uniform standards involving long-term care insurance products by expressly providing for such opt out in the enacted compact, and such an opt out shall not be treated as a material variance in the offer or acceptance of any state to participate in the compact. Such an opt out shall be effective at the time of enactment of the compact by the compacting state and shall apply to all existing uniform standards involving long-term care insurance products and those subsequently promulgated.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a compacting state elects to opt out of a uniform standard, the uniform standard shall remain applicable in the compacting state electing to opt out until such time the opt out legislation is enacted into law or the regulation opting out becomes effective. Once the opt out of a uniform standard by a compacting state becomes effective as provided under the laws of that state, the uniform standard shall have no further force and effect in that state unless and until the legislation or regulation implementing the opt out is repealed or otherwise becomes ineffective under the laws of the state. If a compacting state opts out of a uniform standard after the uniform standard has been made effective in that state, the opt out shall have the same prospective effect as provided under RCW 48.130.130 for withdrawals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a compacting state has formally initiated the process of opting out of a uniform standard by regulation, and while the regulatory opt out is pending, the compacting state may petition the commission, at least fifteen days before the effective date of the uniform standard, to stay the effectiveness of the uniform standard in that state. The commission may grant a stay if it determines the regulatory opt out is being pursued in a reasonable manner and there is a likelihood of success. If a stay is granted or extended by the commission, the stay or extension thereof may postpone the effective date by up to ninety days, unless affirmatively extended by the commission. However, a stay may not be permitted to remain in effect for more than one year unless the compacting state can show extraordinary circumstances which warrant a continuance of the stay, including, but not limited to, the existence of a legal challenge which prevents the compacting state from opting out. A stay may be terminated by the commission upon notice that the rule-making process has been terminated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not later than thirty days after a rule or operating procedure is adopted, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule or operating procedure. However, the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule or operating procedure from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule or operating procedure to be unlawful if the rule or operating procedure represents a reasonable exercise of the commission's authority.</p>

<p>Except as to privileged records, data, and information, the laws of any compacting state pertaining to confidentiality or nondisclosure shall not relieve any compacting state commissioner of the duty to disclose any relevant records, data or information to the commission. However, disclosure to the commission does not waive or otherwise affect any confidentiality requirement. Also, except as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter, the commission shall not be subject to the compacting state's laws pertaining to confidentiality and nondisclosure with respect to records, data, and information in its possession. Confidential information of the commission shall remain confidential after such information is provided to any commissioner.</p>

<p>The commission shall monitor compacting states for compliance with duly adopted bylaws, rules, including uniform standards, and operating procedures. The commission shall notify any noncomplying compacting state in writing of its noncompliance with commission bylaws, rules or operating procedures. If a noncomplying compacting state fails to remedy its noncompliance within the time specified in the notice of noncompliance, the compacting state shall be deemed to be in default as set forth in RCW 48.130.130.</p>

<li>
<p>The commissioner of any state in which an insurer is authorized to do business, or is conducting the business of insurance, shall continue to exercise his or her authority to oversee the market regulation of the activities of the insurer in accordance with the provisions of the state's law. The commissioner's enforcement of compliance with the compact is governed by the following provisions:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>With respect to the commissioner's market regulation of a product or advertisement that is approved or certified to the commission, the content of the product or advertisement shall not constitute a violation of the provisions, standards, or requirements of the compact except upon a final order of the commission, issued at the request of a commissioner after prior notice to the insurer and an opportunity for hearing before the commission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before a commissioner may bring an action for violation of any provision, standard, or requirement of the compact relating to the content of an advertisement not approved or certified to the commission, the commission, or an authorized commission officer or employee, must authorize the action. However, authorization under this subsection (4)(b) does not require notice to the insurer, opportunity for hearing, or disclosure of requests for authorization or records of the commission's action on such requests.</p>
