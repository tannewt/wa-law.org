<p>In the case of policies issued on and after the operative date of this chapter as defined in RCW 48.76.100, no policy of life insurance, except as stated in RCW 48.76.090, may be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it contains in substance the following provisions, or corresponding provisions which in the opinion of the commissioner are at least as favorable to the defaulting or surrendering policyholder as are the minimum requirements specified in this chapter and are essentially in compliance with RCW 48.76.080:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>That, in the event of default in any premium payment, the company will grant, upon proper request not later than sixty days after the due date of the premium in default, a paid-up nonforfeiture benefit on a plan stipulated in the policy, effective as of such due date, of such amount as may be specified in this chapter. In lieu of such stipulated paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, the company may substitute, upon proper request not later than sixty days after the due date of the premium in default, an actuarially equivalent alternative paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which provides a greater amount or longer period of death benefits or, if applicable, a greater amount or earlier payment of endowment benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That, upon surrender of the policy within sixty days after the due date of any premium payment in default after premiums have been paid for at least three full years in the case of ordinary insurance or five full years in the case of industrial insurance, the company will pay, in lieu of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, a cash surrender value of such amount as may be specified in this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That a specified paid-up nonforfeiture benefit becomes effective as specified in the policy unless the person entitled to make such election elects another available option not later than sixty days after the due date of the premium in default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That if the policy has become paid-up by completion of all premium payments or if it is continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which became effective on or after the third policy anniversary in the case of ordinary insurance or the fifth policy anniversary in the case of industrial insurance, the company will pay, upon surrender of the policy within thirty days after any policy anniversary, a cash surrender value of such amount as may be specified in this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That policies which cause on a basis guaranteed in the policy unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or which provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, a statement of the mortality table, interest rate, and method used in calculating cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy. In the case of all other policies, a statement of the mortality table and interest rate used in calculating the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy, together with a table showing the cash surrender value, if any, and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, if any, available under the policy on each policy anniversary either during the first twenty policy years or during the term of the policy, whichever is shorter, such values and benefits to be calculated upon the assumption that there are no dividends or paid-up additions credited to the policy and that there is no indebtedness to the company on the policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A statement that the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy are not less than the minimum values and benefits required by or pursuant to the insurance law of the state in which the policy is delivered; an explanation of the manner in which the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits are altered by the existence of any paid-up additions credited to the policy or any indebtedness to the company on the policy; if a detailed statement of the method of computation of the values and benefits shown in the policy is not stated therein, a statement that such method of computation has been filed with the insurance supervisory official of the state in which the policy is delivered; and a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender value and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy on any policy anniversary beyond the last anniversary for which such values and benefits are consecutively shown in the policy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Any of the foregoing provisions or portions thereof not applicable by reason of the plan of insurance may, to the extent inapplicable, be omitted from the policy.</p>
<p>The company shall reserve the right to defer the payment of any cash surrender value for a period of six months after demand therefor with surrender of the policy.</p>

<li>
<p>This section does not apply to policies issued on or after the operative date of subsection (7) of this section. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts stated in the policy as extra premiums to cover impairments or special hazards, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all such adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Two percent of the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or of the equivalent uniform amount, as defined, if the amount of insurance varies with duration of the policy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forty percent of the adjusted premium for the first policy year;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Twenty-five percent of either the adjusted premium for the first policy year or the adjusted premium for a whole life policy of the same uniform or equivalent uniform amount with uniform premiums for the whole of life issued at the same age for the same amount of insurance, whichever is less.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>However, in applying the percentages specified in (c) and (d) of this subsection, no adjusted premium shall be deemed to exceed four percent of the amount of insurance or level amount equivalent thereto. The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this section shall be the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>In the case of a policy providing an amount of insurance varying with duration of the policy, the equivalent level amount thereof for the purpose of this section shall be deemed to be the level amount of insurance provided by an otherwise similar policy, containing the same endowment benefit or benefits, if any, issued at the same age and for the same term, the amount of which does not vary with duration and the benefits under which have the same present value at the inception of the insurance as the benefits under the policy: PROVIDED HOWEVER, That in the case of a policy providing a varying amount of insurance issued on the life of a child under age ten, the equivalent uniform amount may be computed as though the amount provided by the policy prior to the attainment of age ten were the amount provided by such policy at age ten.</p>

<li>
<p>The adjusted premiums for any policy providing term insurance benefits by rider or supplemental policy provision shall be equal to:</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in subsections (5) and (6) of this section, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this chapter shall for all policies of ordinary insurance be calculated on the basis of the commissioner's 1941 standard ordinary mortality table: PROVIDED, That for any category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks on or after July 1, 1957, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age not more than six years younger than the actual age of the insured and such calculations for all policies of industrial insurance shall be made on the basis of the 1941 standard industrial mortality table. All calculations shall be made on the basis of the rate of interest, not exceeding three and one-half percent per annum, specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits: PROVIDED, That in calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than one hundred thirty percent of the rates of mortality according to such applicable table: PROVIDED, FURTHER, That for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the company and approved by the commissioner.</p>

In the case of ordinary policies issued on or after the operative date of this section, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this chapter shall be calculated on the basis of the commissioner's 1958 standard ordinary mortality table and the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits provided that such rate of interest shall not exceed three and one-half percent per annum except that a rate of interest not exceeding four percent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after July 16, 1973, and before September 1, 1979, and a rate of interest not exceeding five and one-half percent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after September 1, 1979, except that for any single premium whole life or endowment insurance policy a rate of interest not exceeding six and one-half percent per annum may be used and provided that for any category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age not more than six years younger than the actual age of the insured: PROVIDED, That in calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the commissioner's 1958 extended term insurance table: PROVIDED FURTHER, That for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the company and approved by the commissioner.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After June 11, 1959, any company may file with the commissioner a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this section. After the filing of such notice, then upon such specified date (which shall be the operative date of this section for such company), this subsection shall become operative with respect to the ordinary policies thereafter issued by such company.

<li>This subsection does not apply to industrial policies issued on or after the operative date of subsection (7) of this section. In the case of industrial policies issued on or after the operative date of this chapter, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this chapter shall be calculated on the basis of the commissioner's 1961 standard industrial mortality table and the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits provided that such rate of interest shall not exceed three and one-half percent per annum, except that a rate of interest not exceeding four percent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after July 16, 1973, and prior to September 1, 1979, and a rate of interest not exceeding five and one-half percent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after September 1, 1979, except that for any single premium whole life or endowment insurance policy a rate of interest not exceeding six and one-half percent per annum may be used: PROVIDED, That in calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the commissioner's 1961 industrial extended term insurance table: PROVIDED FURTHER, That for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculations of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the company and approved by the commissioner.</li>

<p>At the option of the company, calculations for all policies issued in a particular calendar year may be made on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate, as defined in this section, for policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year.</p>

<p>This section, in addition to all other applicable sections of this chapter, shall apply to all policies issued on or after January 1, 1986. Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be in an amount which does not differ by more than two-tenths of one percent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years, from the sum of: (a) The greater of zero and the basic cash value specified in subsection (2) of this section; and (b) the present value of any existing paid-up additions less the amount of any indebtedness to the company under the policy.</p>

<p>The basic cash value shall be equal to the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, excluding any existing paid-up additions and before deduction of any indebtedness to the company, if there had been no default, less the then present value of the nonforfeiture factors, as defined in subsection (3) of this section, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such anniversary: PROVIDED, That the effects on the basic cash value of supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits or of family coverage, as described in RCW 48.76.030 or * 48.76.050(4), whichever is applicable, shall be the same as are the effects specified in RCW 48.76.030 or * 48.76.050(4), whichever is applicable, on the cash surrender values defined in that section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nonforfeiture factor for each policy year shall be an amount equal to a percentage of the adjusted premium for the policy year, as defined in *RCW 48.76.050 (1) or (4). Except as is required by the next succeeding sentence of this paragraph, such percentage:</p>
