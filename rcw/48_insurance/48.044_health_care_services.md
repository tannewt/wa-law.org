## 48.44.023 - Health plan benefits for small employers—Coverage—Exemption from statutory requirements—Premium rates—Requirements for providing coverage for small employers.
1. [Empty]

    a.  A health care services contractor offering any health benefit plan to a small employer, either directly or through an association or member-governed group formed specifically for the purpose of purchasing health care, may offer and actively market to the small employer a health benefit plan featuring a limited schedule of covered health care services. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude a contractor from offering, or a small employer from purchasing, other health benefit plans that may have more comprehensive benefits than those included in the product offered under this subsection. A contractor offering a health benefit plan under this subsection shall clearly disclose all covered benefits to the small employer in a brochure filed with the commissioner.

    b.  A health benefit plan offered under this subsection shall provide coverage for hospital expenses and services rendered by a physician licensed under chapter 18.57 or 18.71 RCW but is not subject to the requirements of RCW 48.44.225, 48.44.240, 48.44.245, 48.44.290, 48.44.300, 48.44.310, 48.44.320, 48.44.325, 48.44.330, 48.44.335, 48.44.344, 48.44.360, 48.44.400, 48.44.440, 48.44.450, and 48.44.460.

2. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a health care service contractor from offering, or a purchaser from seeking, health benefit plans with benefits in excess of the health benefit plan offered under subsection (1) of this section. All forms, policies, and contracts shall be submitted for approval to the commissioner, and the rates of any plan offered under this section shall be reasonable in relation to the benefits thereto.

3. Premium rates for health benefit plans for small employers as defined in this section shall be subject to the following provisions:

    a.  The contractor shall develop its rates based on an adjusted community rate and may only vary the adjusted community rate for:

        i.  Geographic area;

        ii.  Family size;

        iii.  Age; and

        iv.  Wellness activities.

    b.  The adjustment for age in (a)(iii) of this subsection may not use age brackets smaller than five-year increments, which shall begin with age twenty and end with age sixty-five. Employees under the age of twenty shall be treated as those age twenty.

    c.  The contractor shall be permitted to develop separate rates for individuals age sixty-five or older for coverage for which medicare is the primary payer and coverage for which medicare is not the primary payer. Both rates shall be subject to the requirements of this subsection (3).

    d.  The permitted rates for any age group shall be no more than four hundred twenty-five percent of the lowest rate for all age groups on January 1, 1996, four hundred percent on January 1, 1997, and three hundred seventy-five percent on January 1, 2000, and thereafter.

    e.  A discount for wellness activities shall be permitted to reflect actuarially justified differences in utilization or cost attributed to such programs. Up to a twenty percent variance may be allowed for small employers that develop and implement a wellness program or activities that directly improve employee wellness. Employers shall document program activities with the carrier and may, after three years of implementation, request a reduction in premiums based on improved employee health and wellness. While carriers may review the employer's claim history when making a determination regarding whether the employer's wellness program has improved employee health, the carrier may not use maternity or prevention services claims to deny the employer's request. Carriers may consider issues such as improved productivity or a reduction in absenteeism due to illness if submitted by the employer for consideration. Interested employers may also work with the carrier to develop a wellness program and a means to track improved employee health.

    f.  The rate charged for a health benefit plan offered under this section may not be adjusted more frequently than annually except that the premium may be changed to reflect:

        i.  Changes to the enrollment of the small employer;

        ii.  Changes to the family composition of the employee;

        iii.  Changes to the health benefit plan requested by the small employer; or

        iv.  Changes in government requirements affecting the health benefit plan.

    g.  On the census date, as defined in RCW 48.44.010, rating factors shall produce premiums for identical groups that differ only by the amounts attributable to plan design, and differences in census date between new and renewal groups, with the exception of discounts for health improvement programs.

    h.  For the purposes of this section, a health benefit plan that contains a restricted network provision shall not be considered similar coverage to a health benefit plan that does not contain such a provision, provided that the restrictions of benefits to network providers result in substantial differences in claims costs. A carrier may develop its rates based on claims costs due to network provider reimbursement schedules or type of network. This subsection does not restrict or enhance the portability of benefits as provided in *RCW 48.43.015.

    i.  Adjusted community rates established under this section shall pool the medical experience of all groups purchasing coverage, including the small group participants in the health insurance partnership established in **RCW 70.47A.030. However, annual rate adjustments for each small group health benefit plan may vary by up to plus or minus four percentage points from the overall adjustment of a carrier's entire small group pool, such overall adjustment to be approved by the commissioner, upon a showing by the carrier, certified by a member of the American academy of actuaries that: (i) The variation is a result of deductible leverage, benefit design, or provider network characteristics; and (ii) for a rate renewal period, the projected weighted average of all small group benefit plans will have a revenue neutral effect on the carrier's small group pool. Variations of greater than four percentage points are subject to review by the commissioner, and must be approved or denied within sixty days of submittal. A variation that is not denied within sixty days shall be deemed approved. The commissioner must provide to the carrier a detailed actuarial justification for any denial within thirty days of the denial.

    j.  For health benefit plans purchased through the health insurance partnership established in **chapter 70.47A RCW:

        i.  Any surcharge established pursuant to **RCW 70.47A.030(2)(e) shall be applied only to health benefit plans purchased through the health insurance partnership; and

        ii.  Risk adjustment or reinsurance mechanisms may be used by the health insurance partnership program to redistribute funds to carriers participating in the health insurance partnership based on differences in risk attributable to individual choice of health plans or other factors unique to health insurance partnership participation. Use of such mechanisms shall be limited to the partnership program and will not affect small group health plans offered outside the partnership.

    k.  If the rate developed under this section varies the adjusted community rate for the factors listed in (a) of this subsection, the date for determining those factors must be no more than ninety days prior to the effective date of the health benefit plan.

4. Nothing in this section shall restrict the right of employees to collectively bargain for insurance providing benefits in excess of those provided herein.

5. [Empty]

    a.  Except as provided in this subsection and subsection (3)(g) of this section, requirements used by a contractor in determining whether to provide coverage to a small employer shall be applied uniformly among all small employers applying for coverage or receiving coverage from the carrier.

    b.  A contractor shall not require a minimum participation level greater than:

        i.  One hundred percent of eligible employees working for groups with three or less employees; and

        ii.  Seventy-five percent of eligible employees working for groups with more than three employees.

    c.  In applying minimum participation requirements with respect to a small employer, a small employer shall not consider employees or dependents who have similar existing coverage in determining whether the applicable percentage of participation is met.

    d.  A contractor may not increase any requirement for minimum employee participation or modify any requirement for minimum employer contribution applicable to a small employer at any time after the small employer has been accepted for coverage.

    e.  Minimum participation requirements and employer premium contribution requirements adopted by the health insurance partnership board under **RCW 70.47A.110 shall apply only to the employers and employees who purchase health benefit plans through the health insurance partnership.

6. A contractor must offer coverage to all eligible employees of a small employer and their dependents. A contractor may not offer coverage to only certain individuals or dependents in a small employer group or to only part of the group. A contractor may not modify a health plan with respect to a small employer or any eligible employee or dependent, through riders, endorsements or otherwise, to restrict or exclude coverage or benefits for specific diseases, medical conditions, or services otherwise covered by the plan.

Eligible enrolled participants shall not be subject to preexisting condition limitations except to the extent that a waiting period for a preexisting condition has not been satisfied under the insolvent carrier's group plan. An open enrollment shall not be required where the agreement holder participates in a self-insured, self-funded, or other health plan exempt from commissioner rule, unless the plan administrator and agreement holder voluntarily agree to offer a simultaneous open enrollment and extend coverage under the same enrollment terms and conditions as are applicable to carriers under this title and rules adopted under this title.

The eligible enrolled participants shall not be subject to preexisting condition limitations except to the extent that a waiting period for a preexisting condition has not been satisfied under the insolvent carrier's group plan. No offering by a carrier shall be required where the agreement holder participates in a self-insured, self-funded, or other health plan exempt from commissioner rule. The carrier may offer the agreement holder the same coverage as any self-insured plan or plans offered by the agreement holder without regard to coverage, benefit, or provider requirements mandated by this title for the duration of the current agreement period.

2. The commissioner shall also allocate equitably the insolvent carrier's nongroup enrolled participants who are unable to obtain coverage among all carriers that operate within a portion of the insolvent carrier's service area, taking into consideration the health care delivery resources of the carrier. Each carrier to which nongroup enrolled participants are allocated shall offer the nongroup enrolled participants the carrier's existing comprehensive conversion plan, without additional medical underwriting, at rates determined in accordance with the successor carrier's existing rating methodology. The eligible enrolled participants shall not be subject to preexisting condition limitations except to the extent that a waiting period for a preexisting condition has not been satisfied under the insolvent carrier's plan.

3. Any agreements covering participants allocated pursuant to subsections (1)(b) and (2) of this section to carriers pursuant to this section may be rerated after ninety days of coverage.

## 48.44.290 - Registered nurses or advanced registered nurses.
Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, for any health care service contract thereunder which is entered into or renewed after July 26, 1981, benefits shall not be denied under such contract for any health care service performed by a holder of a license for registered nursing practice or advanced registered nursing practice issued pursuant to chapter 18.79 RCW if (1) the service performed was within the lawful scope of such person's license, and (2) such contract would have provided benefits if such service had been performed by a holder of a license issued pursuant to chapter 18.71 RCW: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That no provision of chapter 18.71 RCW shall be asserted to deny benefits under this section.

The provisions of this section are intended to be remedial and procedural to the extent that they do not impair the obligation of any existing contract.

## 48.44.299 - Legislative finding.
The legislature finds and declares that there is a paramount concern that the right of the people to obtain access to health care in all its facets is being impaired by prepaid agreements which provide benefits, reimbursement, or indemnity by health care service contractors, whether for profit or for nonprofit, which do not provide parity of reimbursement among licensed health care providers performing the same health care services. It is further the intent of the legislature not to mandate the providing of any health care benefit, but rather to require parity of reimbursement for the same health care services performed by all licensees who perform such services within the scope of their respective licenses thereby assuring the people of the state access to health care services of their choice.

\[ [1983 c 154 § 1](http://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1983c154.pdf?cite=1983%20c%20154%20§%201); \]

## 48.44.300 - Podiatric medicine and surgery—Benefits not to be denied.
Benefits shall not be denied under a contract for any health care service performed by a holder of a license issued under chapter 18.22 RCW if (1) the service performed was within the lawful scope of the person's license, and (2) the contract would have provided benefits if the service had been performed by a holder of a license issued under chapter 18.71 RCW. There shall not be imposed upon one class of doctors providing health care services as defined by this chapter any requirement that is not imposed upon all other doctors providing the same or similar health care services within the scope of their license.

The provisions of this section are intended to be procedural to the extent that they do not impair the obligation of any existing contract.

\[ [1986 c 223 § 7](http://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1986c223.pdf?cite=1986%20c%20223%20§%207); [1983 c 154 § 2](http://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1983c154.pdf?cite=1983%20c%20154%20§%202); \]

## 48.44.305 - When injury caused by intoxication or use of narcotics.
A health care service contractor may not deny coverage for the treatment of an injury solely because the injury was sustained as a consequence of the enrolled participant's being intoxicated or under the influence of a narcotic.

\[ [2004 c 112 § 4](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2014.SL.pdf?cite=2004%20c%20112%20§%204); \]

## 48.44.309 - Legislative finding.
The legislature finds and declares that there is a paramount concern that the right of the people to obtain access to health care in all its facets is being impaired. The legislature further finds that there is a heavy reliance by the public upon prepaid health care service agreements and insurance, whether profit or nonprofit, as the only effective manner in which the large majority of the people can obtain access to quality health care. Further, the legislature finds that health care service agreements may be anticompetitive because of the exclusion of other licensed forms of health care and that because of the high costs of health care, there is a need for competition to reduce these costs. It is, therefore, declared to be in the public interest that these contracts as a form of insurance be regulated under the police power of the state to assure that all the people have the greatest access to health care services.

\[ [1983 c 286 § 1](http://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1983c286.pdf?cite=1983%20c%20286%20§%201); \]

## 48.44.310 - Chiropractic care, coverage required, exceptions.
1. Each group contract for comprehensive health care service which is entered into, or renewed, on or after September 8, 1983, between a health care service contractor and the person or persons to receive such care shall offer coverage for chiropractic care on the same basis as any other care.

2. A patient of a chiropractor shall not be denied benefits under a contract because the practitioner is not licensed under chapter 18.57 or 18.71 RCW.

3. This section shall not apply to a group contract for comprehensive health care services entered into in accordance with a collective bargaining agreement between management and labor representatives. Benefits for chiropractic care shall be offered by the employer in good faith on the same basis as any other care as a subject for collective bargaining for group contracts for health care services.

\[ [1986 c 223 § 8](http://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1986c223.pdf?cite=1986%20c%20223%20§%208); [1983 c 286 § 2](http://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1983c286.pdf?cite=1983%20c%20286%20§%202); \]

## 48.44.315 - Diabetes coverage—Definitions.
The legislature finds that diabetes imposes a significant health risk and tremendous financial burden on the citizens and government of the state of Washington, and that access to the medically accepted standards of care for diabetes, its treatment and supplies, and self-management training and education is crucial to prevent or delay the short and long-term complications of diabetes and its attendant costs.

1. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

    a.  "Person with diabetes" means a person diagnosed by a health care provider as having insulin using diabetes, noninsulin using diabetes, or elevated blood glucose levels induced by pregnancy; and

    b.  "Health care provider" means a health care provider as defined in RCW 48.43.005.

2. All health benefit plans offered by health care service contractors, issued or renewed after January 1, 1998, shall provide benefits for at least the following services and supplies for persons with diabetes:

    a.  For health benefit plans that include coverage for pharmacy services, appropriate and medically necessary equipment and supplies, as prescribed by a health care provider, that includes but is not limited to insulin, syringes, injection aids, blood glucose monitors, test strips for blood glucose monitors, visual reading and urine test strips, insulin pumps and accessories to the pumps, insulin infusion devices, prescriptive oral agents for controlling blood sugar levels, foot care appliances for prevention of complications associated with diabetes, and glucagon emergency kits; and

    b.  For all health benefit plans, outpatient self-management training and education, including medical nutrition therapy, as ordered by the health care provider. Diabetes outpatient self-management training and education may be provided only by health care providers with expertise in diabetes. Nothing in this section prevents the health care services contractor from restricting patients to seeing only health care providers who have signed participating provider agreements with the health care services contractor or an insuring entity under contract with the health care services contractor.

3. Except as provided in RCW 48.43.780, coverage required under this section may be subject to customary cost-sharing provisions established for all other similar services or supplies within a policy.

4. Health care coverage may not be reduced or eliminated due to this section.

5. Services required under this section shall be covered when deemed medically necessary by the medical director, or his or her designee, subject to any referral and formulary requirements.

6. The health care service contractor need not include the coverage required in this section in a group contract offered to an employer or other group that offers to its eligible enrollees a self-insured health plan not subject to mandated benefits status under this title that does not offer coverage similar to that mandated under this section.

7. This section does not apply to the health benefit plans that provide benefits identical to the schedule of services covered by the basic health plan.

## 48.44.320 - Home health care, hospice care, optional coverage required—Standards, limitations, restrictions—Rules—Medicare supplemental contracts excluded.
1. Every health care service contractor entering into or renewing a group health care service contract governed by this chapter shall offer optional coverage for home health care and hospice care for persons who are homebound and would otherwise require hospitalization. Such optional coverage need only be offered in conjunction with a policy that provides payment for hospitalization as a part of health care coverage. Persons seeking such services for palliative care in conjunction with treatment or management of serious or life-threatening illness need not be homebound in order to be eligible for coverage under this section.

2. Home health care and hospice care coverage offered under subsection (1) of this section shall conform to the following standards, limitations, and restrictions in addition to those set forth in chapters 70.126 and 70.127 RCW:

    b.  The coverage should be structured to create incentives for the use of home health care and hospice care as an alternative to hospitalization;

    c.  The coverage may contain provisions for utilization review and quality assurance;

    d.  The coverage may require that home health agencies and hospices have written treatment plans approved by a physician licensed under chapter 18.57 or 18.71 RCW, and may require such treatment plans to be reviewed at designated intervals;

    e.  The coverage shall provide benefits for, and restrict benefits to, services rendered by home health and hospice agencies licensed under chapter 70.127 RCW;

    f.  Hospice care coverage shall provide benefits for terminally ill patients for an initial period of care of not less than six months and may provide benefits for an additional six months of care in cases where the patient is facing imminent death or is entering remission if certified in writing by the attending physician;

    g.  Home health care coverage shall provide benefits for a minimum of one hundred thirty health care visits per calendar year. However, a visit of any duration by an employee of a home health agency for the purpose of providing services under the plan of treatment constitutes one visit;

    h.  The coverage may be structured so that services or supplies included in the primary contract are not duplicated in the optional home health and hospice coverage.

3. The insurance commissioner shall adopt any rules necessary to implement this section.

4. The requirements of this section shall not apply to contracts or policies governed by chapter 48.66 RCW.

5. An insurer, as a condition of reimbursement, may require compliance with home health and hospice certification regulations established by the United States department of health and human services.

This section shall not be construed to prevent the application of standard contract provisions applicable to other benefits such as deductible or copayment provisions.

Wellness and preventive services that are provided or reimbursed at a lesser copayment, coinsurance, or other cost sharing than other medical and surgical services are excluded from this comparison. If the health benefit plan imposes a maximum out-of-pocket limit or stop loss, it shall be a single limit or stop loss for medical, surgical, and mental health services.

3. This section does not prohibit a requirement that mental health services be medically necessary, if a comparable requirement is applicable to medical and surgical services.
