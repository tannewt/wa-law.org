<ol>
<li>
<p>A domestic insurer, either by itself or in cooperation with one or more persons, may organize or acquire one or more subsidiaries. The subsidiaries may conduct any kind of business or businesses and their authority to do so is not limited by reason of the fact that they are subsidiaries of a domestic insurer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to investments in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities permitted under this title, a domestic insurer may also:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Invest in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities of one or more subsidiaries, amounts which do not exceed the lesser of ten percent of the insurer's assets or fifty percent of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders, provided that, after such investments, the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders will be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs. In calculating the amount of such investments, investments in domestic or foreign insurance subsidiaries, health maintenance organizations, and health care service contractors are excluded, and there is included:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Total net moneys or other consideration expended and obligations assumed in the acquisition or formation of a subsidiary, including all organizational expenses and contributions to capital and surplus of the subsidiary whether or not represented by the purchase of capital stock or issuance of other securities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All amounts expended in acquiring additional common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All contributions to the capital and surplus of a subsidiary subsequent to its acquisition or formation;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invest any amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities of one or more subsidiaries engaged or organized to engage exclusively in the ownership and management of assets authorized as investments for the insurer provided that each subsidiary agrees to limit its investments in any asset so that such investments will not cause the amount of the total investment of the insurer to exceed any of the investment limitations specified in (a) of this subsection or chapter 48.13 RCW applicable to the insurer. For the purpose of this subsection, the total investment of the insurer includes:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Any direct investment by the insurer in an asset;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The insurer's proportionate share of any investment in an asset by any subsidiary of the insurer, which is calculated by multiplying the amount of the subsidiary's investment by the percentage of the ownership of the subsidiary; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the approval of the commissioner, any greater amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, or other securities of one or more subsidiaries, provided that after the investment the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders will be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investments in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, or other securities made according to subsection (2) of this section are not subject to any of the otherwise applicable restrictions or prohibitions contained in this title applicable to such investments of insurers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether any investment made according to subsection (2) of this section meets the applicable requirements of that subsection is to be determined before the investment is made, by calculating the applicable investment limitations as though the investment had already been made, taking into account the then outstanding principal balance on all previous investments in debt obligations, and the value of all previous investments in equity securities as of the day they were made, net of any return of capital invested, net including dividends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an insurer ceases to control a subsidiary, it shall dispose of any investment in that subsidiary within three years from the time of the cessation of control or within such further time as the commissioner may prescribe, unless at any time after the investment was made, the investment met the requirements for investment under any other section of this title, and the insurer has notified the commissioner thereof.</p>

The commissioner determines whether the person or persons seeking to divest or acquire a controlling interest in an insurer must file and obtain approval of the transaction.

</li>
<li>
<p>Such additional information as the commissioner may prescribe by rule as necessary or appropriate for the protection of policyholders of the insurer or in the public interest;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the person required to file the statement referred to in subsection (1) of this section is a partnership, limited partnership, syndicate, or other group, the commissioner may require that the information called for by (a) through (n) of this subsection must be given with respect to each partner of the partnership or limited partnership, each member of the syndicate or group, and each person who controls a partner or member.

<p>The commissioner shall approve a merger or other acquisition of control referred to in subsection (1) of this section unless, after a public hearing thereon, he or she finds that:</p>

<li>
<p>After the change of control, the domestic insurer referred to in subsection (1) of this section would not be able to satisfy the requirements for the issuance of a license to write the line or lines of insurance for which it is presently licensed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The effect of the merger or other acquisition of control would be substantially to lessen competition in insurance in this state or tend to create a monopoly therein. In applying the competitive standard in this subsection (4)(a)(ii):</p>

<p>The plans or proposals which the acquiring party has to liquidate the insurer, sell its assets, consolidate or merge it with any person, or to make any other material change in its business or corporate structure or management, are unfair and unreasonable to policyholders of the insurer and not in the public interest;</p>

<li>
<p>The competence, experience, and integrity of those persons who would control the operation of the insurer are such that it would not be in the interest of policyholders of the insurer and of the public to permit the merger or other acquisition of control; or</p>

<li>
<p>The acquisition is likely to be hazardous or prejudicial to the insurance-buying public.</p>

<p>The public hearing referred to in (a) of this subsection must be held within thirty days after the statement required by subsection (1) of this section is filed, and at least twenty days' notice must be given by the commissioner to the person filing the statement.

<p>A highly concentrated market is one in which the share of the four largest insurers is seventy-five percent or more of the market. Percentages not shown in the tables are interpolated proportionately to the percentages that are shown. If more than two insurers are involved, exceeding the total of the two columns in the table is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard in (a) of this subsection. For the purpose of this subsection (4)(b)(i), the insurer with the largest share of the market is Insurer A.</p>
<pre><code>  ii. There is a significant trend toward increased concentration when the aggregate market share of a grouping of the largest insurers in the market, from the two largest to the eight largest, has increased by seven percent or more of the market over a period of time extending from a base year five to ten years before the acquisition up to the time of the acquisition. An acquisition or merger covered under subsection (2) of this section involving two or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard in (a) of this subsection if:

      A.  There is a significant trend toward increased concentration in the market;

      B.  One of the insurers involved is one of the insurers in a grouping of such large insurers showing the requisite increase in the market share; and

      C.  Another involved insurer's market is two percent or more.

  iii. For the purposes of this subsection (4)(b):

       A.  &quot;Insurer&quot; includes any company or group of companies under common management, ownership, or control;

       B.  &quot;Market&quot; means the relevant product and geographical markets. In determining the relevant product and geographical markets, the commissioner shall give due consideration to, among other things, the definitions or guidelines, if any, adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and to information, if any, submitted by parties to the acquisition. In the absence of sufficient information to the contrary, the relevant product market is assumed to be the direct written insurance premium for a line of business, such line being that used in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers doing business in this state, and the relevant geographical market is assumed to be this state;

       C.  The burden of showing prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard rests upon the commissioner.

  iv. Even though an acquisition is not prima facie violative of the competitive standard under (b)(i) and (ii) of this subsection, the commissioner may establish the requisite anticompetitive effect based upon other substantial evidence. Even though an acquisition is prima facie violative of the competitive standard under (b)(i) and (ii) of this subsection, a party may establish the absence of the requisite anticompetitive effect based upon other substantial evidence. Relevant factors in making a determination under this subsection include, but are not limited to, the following: Market shares, volatility of ranking of market leaders, number of competitors, concentration, trend of concentration in the industry, and ease of entry and exit into the market.

</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section, an extraordinary dividend or distribution is any dividend or distribution of cash or other property, whose fair market value together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months exceeds the lesser of:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Ten percent of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders or net worth as of December next preceding; or</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining whether a dividend or distribution is extraordinary, an insurer other than a life insurer may carry forward net income from the previous two calendar years that has not already been paid out as dividends. This carry forward provision must be computed by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the second and immediate preceding calendar years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an insurer may declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution that is conditional upon the commissioner's approval. The declaration confers no rights upon shareholders until: (i) The commissioner has approved the payment of the dividend or distribution; or (ii) the commissioner has not disapproved the payment within the thirty-day period referred to in (a) of this subsection.</p>

<p>For purposes of this chapter, in determining whether an insurer's surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs, the following factors, among others, must be considered:</p>

<li>
<p>The size of the insurer as measured by its assets, capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force, and other appropriate criteria;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The extent to which the insurer's business is diversified among several lines of insurance;</p>

<li>
<p>The extent of the geographical dispersion of the insurer's insured risks;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nature and extent of the insurer's reinsurance program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The quality, diversification, and liquidity of the insurer's investment portfolio;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The recent past and projected future trend in the size of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The surplus as regards policyholders maintained by other comparable insurers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The adequacy of the insurer's reserves; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates. The commissioner may treat any such investment as a disallowed asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of surplus as regards policyholders whenever in the judgment of the commissioner the investment so warrants.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the control of a domestic insurer by any person, the officers and directors of the insurer are not thereby relieved of any obligation or liability to which they would otherwise be subject by law, and the insurer must be managed so as to assure its separate operating identity consistent with this title.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not preclude a domestic insurer from having or sharing a common management or cooperative or joint use of personnel, property, or services with one or more other persons under arrangements meeting the standards of subsection (1)(a) of this section.</p>

<p>At least one-third of a domestic insurer's directors and at least one-third of the members of each committee of the insurer's board of directors must be persons who are not: (i) Officers or employees of the insurer or of any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the insurer; or (ii) beneficial owners of a controlling interest in the voting securities of the insurer or of any such entity. A quorum for transacting business at a meeting of the insurer's board of directors or any committee of the board of directors must include at least one such person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board of directors of a domestic insurer shall establish one or more committees comprised solely of directors who are not officers or employees of the insurer or of any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the insurer and who are not beneficial owners of a controlling interest in the voting stock of the insurer or any such entity. The committee or committees have responsibility for nominating candidates for director for election by shareholders or policyholders, evaluating the performance of officers deemed to be principal officers of the insurer, and recommending to the board of directors the selection and compensation of the principal officers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provisions of (c) and (d) of this subsection do not apply to a domestic insurer if the person controlling the insurer, such as an insurer, a mutual holding company, or publicly held corporation, has a board of directors and committees thereof that meet the requirements of (c) and (d) of this subsection with respect to such controlling entity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An insurer may make application to the commissioner for a waiver from the requirements of this subsection, if the insurer's annual direct written and assumed premium, excluding premiums reinsured with the federal crop insurance corporation and federal flood program, is less than three hundred million dollars. An insurer may also make application to the commissioner for a waiver from the requirements of this subsection based upon unique circumstances. The commissioner may consider various factors including, but not limited to, the type of business entity, volume of business written, availability of qualified board members, or the ownership or organizational structure of the entity.</p>

<p>Subject to the limitation contained in this section and in addition to the powers that the commissioner has under chapter 48.03 RCW relating to the examination of insurers, the commissioner has the power to examine any insurer registered under RCW 48.31B.025 and its affiliates to ascertain the financial condition of the insurer, including the enterprise risk to the insurer by the ultimate controlling party, or by any entity or combination of entities within the insurance holding company system, or by the insurance holding company system on a consolidated basis.</p>

<p>To determine compliance with this title, the commissioner may order any insurer registered under RCW 48.31B.025 to produce information not in the possession of the insurer if the insurer can obtain access to such information pursuant to contractual relationships, statutory obligations, or other method. In the event the insurer cannot obtain the information requested by the commissioner, the insurer shall provide the commissioner a detailed explanation of the reason that the insurer cannot obtain the information and the identity of the holder of information. Whenever it appears to the commissioner that the detailed explanation is without merit, the commissioner may require, after notice and hearing, the insurer to pay a fine of ten thousand dollars for each day's delay, or may suspend or revoke the insurer's license. The commissioner shall transfer the fine collected under this section to the state treasurer for deposit into the general fund.</p>

<p>The commissioner may retain at the registered insurer's expense such attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts not otherwise a part of the commissioner's staff as are reasonably necessary to assist in the conduct of the examination under subsection (1) of this section.

<p>In the event the insurer fails to comply with an order, the commissioner has the power to examine the affiliates to obtain the information. The commissioner also has the power to issue subpoenas, to administer oaths, and to examine under oath any person for purposes of determining compliance with this section. Upon the failure or refusal of any person to obey a subpoena, the commissioner may petition a court of competent jurisdiction, and upon proper showing, the court may enter an order compelling the witness to appear and testify or produce documentary evidence. Failure to obey the court order is punishable as contempt of court. Every person is required to attend as a witness at the place specified in the subpoena, when subpoenaed, anywhere within the state. Every person is entitled to the same fees and mileage, if claimed, as a witness as provided in RCW 48.03.070.

However, the commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group-wide supervisor for the internationally active insurance group. The commissioner shall consider the following factors when making a determination or acknowledgment under this subsection:</p>

Prior to issuing a determination that an internationally active insurance group is subject to group-wide supervision by the commissioner, the commissioner shall notify the insurer registered under RCW 48.31B.025 and the ultimate controlling person within the internationally active insurance group. The internationally active insurance group has no less than thirty days to provide the commissioner with additional information pertinent to the pending determination.

</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
<p>The sharing of information by the commissioner pursuant to this chapter does not constitute a delegation of regulatory authority or rule making, and the commissioner is solely responsible for the administration, execution, and enforcement of this chapter.</p>

<p>Whenever it appears to the commissioner that an insurer or a director, officer, employee, or agent of the insurer has committed or is about to commit a violation of this chapter or any rule or order of the commissioner under this chapter, the commissioner may apply to the superior court for Thurston county or to the court for the county in which the principal office of the insurer is located for an order enjoining the insurer or the director, officer, employee, or agent from violating or continuing to violate this chapter or any such rule or order, and for such other equitable relief as the nature of the case and the interest of the insurer's policyholders, creditors, and shareholders or the public may require.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No security that is the subject of an agreement or arrangement regarding acquisition, or that is acquired or to be acquired, in contravention of this chapter or of a rule or order of the commissioner under this chapter may be voted at a shareholders' meeting, or may be counted for quorum purposes. Any action of shareholders requiring the affirmative vote of a percentage of shares may be taken as though the securities were not issued and outstanding, but no action taken at any such meeting may be invalidated by the voting of the securities, unless the action would materially affect control of the insurer or unless the courts of this state have so ordered. If an insurer or the commissioner has reason to believe that a security of the insurer has been or is about to be acquired in contravention of this chapter or of a rule or order of the commissioner under this chapter, the insurer or the commissioner may apply to the superior court for Thurston county or to the court for the county in which the insurer has its principal place of business to enjoin an offer, request, invitation, agreement, or acquisition made in contravention of RCW 48.31B.015 or a rule or order of the commissioner under that section to enjoin the voting of a security so acquired, to void a vote of the security already cast at a meeting of shareholders, and for such other relief as the nature of the case and the interest of the insurer's policyholders, creditors, and shareholders or the public may require.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a person has acquired or is proposing to acquire voting securities in violation of this chapter or a rule or order of the commissioner under this chapter, the superior court for Thurston county or the court for the county in which the insurer has its principal place of business may, on such notice as the court deems appropriate, upon the application of the insurer or the commissioner seize or sequester voting securities of the insurer owned directly or indirectly by the person, and issue such order with respect to the securities as may be appropriate to carry out this chapter.</p>

<p>The commissioner shall require, after notice and hearing, an insurer failing, without just cause, to file a registration statement as required in this chapter, to pay a fine of not more than ten thousand dollars per day. The maximum fine under this section is one million dollars. The commissioner may reduce the fine if the insurer demonstrates to the commissioner that the imposition of the fine would constitute a financial hardship to the insurer. The commissioner shall pay a fine collected under this section to the state treasurer for the account of the general fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every director or officer of an insurance holding company system who knowingly violates this chapter, or participates in, or assents to, or who knowingly permits an officer or agent of the insurer to engage in transactions or make investments that have not been properly reported or submitted under RCW 48.31B.025(1) or 48.31B.030(1)(b) or (2), or that violate this chapter, shall pay, in their individual capacity, a fine of not more than ten thousand dollars per violation, after notice and hearing before the commissioner. In determining the amount of the fine, the commissioner shall take into account the appropriateness of the forfeiture with respect to the gravity of the violation, the history of previous violations, and such other matters as justice may require.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever it appears to the commissioner that an insurer subject to this chapter or a director, officer, employee, or agent of the insurer has engaged in a transaction or entered into a contract that is subject to RCW 48.31B.030 and that would not have been approved had approval been requested, the commissioner may order the insurer to cease and desist immediately any further activity under that transaction or contract. After notice and hearing the commissioner may also order the insurer to void any such contracts and restore the status quo if that action is in the best interest of the policyholders, creditors, or the public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever it appears to the commissioner that an insurer or a director, officer, employee, or agent of the insurer has committed a willful violation of this chapter, the commissioner may refer the matter to the prosecuting attorney of Thurston county or the county in which the principal office of the insurer is located. An insurer that willfully violates this chapter may be fined not more than one million dollars. Any individual who willfully violates this chapter may be fined in his or her individual capacity not more than ten thousand dollars, or be imprisoned for not more than three years, or both.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An officer, director, or employee of an insurance holding company system who willfully and knowingly subscribes to or makes or causes to be made a false statement or false report or false filing with the intent to deceive the commissioner in the performance of his or her duties under this chapter, upon conviction thereof, shall be imprisoned for not more than three years or fined not more than ten thousand dollars or both. The officer, director, or employee upon whom the fine is imposed shall pay the fine in his or her individual capacity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever it appears to the commissioner that any person has committed a violation of RCW 48.31B.015 and which prevents the full understanding of the enterprise risk to the insurer by affiliates or by the insurance holding company system, the violation may serve as an independent basis for disapproving dividends or distributions and for placing the insurer under an order of supervision in accordance with RCW 48.31.400.</p>

<li>
<p>If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of a domestic insurer has been entered, the receiver appointed under the order may recover on behalf of the insurer: (a) From a parent corporation or holding company or person or affiliate who otherwise controlled the insurer, the amount of distributions, other than distributions of shares of the same class of stock, paid by the insurer on its capital stock; or (b) a payment in the form of a bonus, termination settlement, or extraordinary lump sum salary adjustment made by the insurer or its subsidiary to a director, officer, or employee, where the distribution or payment under (a) or (b) of this subsection is made at any time during the one year before the petition for liquidation, conservation, or rehabilitation, as the case may be, subject to the limitations of subsections (2), (3), and (4) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No such distribution is recoverable if it is shown that when paid, the distribution was lawful and reasonable, and that the insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person who was a parent corporation or holding company or a person who otherwise controlled the insurer or affiliate when the distributions were paid is liable up to the amount of distributions or payments under subsection (1) of this section the person received. A person who controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were declared is liable up to the amount of distributions he or she would have received if they had been paid immediately. If two or more persons are liable with respect to the same distributions, they are jointly and severally liable.</p>

<li>
<p>The maximum amount recoverable under this section is the amount needed in excess of all other available assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer to pay the contractual obligations of the impaired or insolvent insurer and to reimburse any guaranty funds.</p>

<p>To the extent that a person liable under subsection (3) of this section is insolvent or otherwise fails to pay claims due from it under those provisions, its parent corporation or holding company or person who otherwise controlled it at the time the distribution was paid, is jointly and severally liable for a resulting deficiency in the amount recovered from the parent corporation or holding company or person who otherwise controlled it.</p>
