<p>In affirmation of the declared principle that health care is a right of every citizen of the state, the legislature expresses its concern that the present high costs of health care in Washington may be preventing or inhibiting a large segment of the people from obtaining access to quality health care services.</p>
<p>The legislature declares that the establishment of qualified prepaid group and individual practice health care delivery systems should be encouraged in order to provide all citizens of the state with the freedom of choice between competitive, alternative health care delivery systems necessary to realize their right to health. It is the purpose and policy of this chapter to provide for the development and registration of prepaid group and individual practice health care plans as health maintenance organizations, which the legislature declares to be in the interest of the health, safety and welfare of the people.</p>

     D.  Tenure discounts; and

  ii. The adjustment for age in (c)(i)(C) of this subsection may not use age brackets smaller than five-year increments which shall begin with age twenty and end with age sixty-five. Individuals under the age of twenty shall be treated as those age twenty.

  iii. The health maintenance organization shall be permitted to develop separate rates for individuals age sixty-five or older for coverage for which medicare is the primary payer, and coverage for which medicare is not the primary payer. Both rates are subject to the requirements of this subsection.

  iv. The permitted rates for any age group shall be no more than four hundred twenty-five percent of the lowest rate for all age groups on January 1, 1996, four hundred percent on January 1, 1997, and three hundred seventy-five percent on January 1, 2000, and thereafter.

  v. A discount for wellness activities shall be permitted to reflect actuarially justified differences in utilization or cost attributed to such programs.

  vi. The rate charged for a health benefit plan offered under this section may not be adjusted more frequently than annually except that the premium may be changed to reflect:

      A.  Changes to the family composition;

      B.  Changes to the health benefit plan requested by the individual; or

      C.  Changes in government requirements affecting the health benefit plan.

  vii. For the purposes of this section, a health benefit plan that contains a restricted network provision shall not be considered similar coverage to a health benefit plan that does not contain such a provision, provided that the restrictions of benefits to network providers result in substantial differences in claims costs. This subsection does not restrict or enhance the portability of benefits as provided in *RCW 48.43.015.

  viii. A tenure discount for continuous enrollment in the health plan of two years or more may be offered, not to exceed ten percent.

A health maintenance organization offering a health benefit plan under this subsection shall clearly disclose all the covered benefits to the small employer in a brochure filed with the commissioner.</p>

<p>The health maintenance organization shall be permitted to develop separate rates for individuals age sixty-five or older for coverage for which medicare is the primary payer and coverage for which medicare is not the primary payer.

<li>
<p>A discount for wellness activities shall be permitted to reflect actuarially justified differences in utilization or cost attributed to such programs. Up to a twenty percent variance may be allowed for small employers that develop and implement a wellness program or activities that directly improve employee wellness. Employers shall document program activities with the carrier and may, after three years of implementation, request a reduction in premiums based on improved employee health and wellness. While carriers may review the employer's claim history when making a determination regarding whether the employer's wellness program has improved employee health, the carrier may not use maternity or prevention services claims to deny the employer's request. Carriers may consider issues such as improved productivity or a reduction in absenteeism due to illness if submitted by the employer for consideration. Interested employers may also work with the carrier to develop a wellness program and a means to track improved employee health.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this section, a health benefit plan that contains a restricted network provision shall not be considered similar coverage to a health benefit plan that does not contain such a provision, provided that the restrictions of benefits to network providers result in substantial differences in claims costs.

<p>Adjusted community rates established under this section shall pool the medical experience of all groups purchasing coverage, including the small group participants in the health insurance partnership established in **RCW 70.47A.030. However, annual rate adjustments for each small group health benefit plan may vary by up to plus or minus four percentage points from the overall adjustment of a carrier's entire small group pool, such overall adjustment to be approved by the commissioner, upon a showing by the carrier, certified by a member of the American academy of actuaries that: (i) The variation is a result of deductible leverage, benefit design, or provider network characteristics; and (ii) for a rate renewal period, the projected weighted average of all small group benefit plans will have a revenue neutral effect on the carrier's small group pool. Variations of greater than four percentage points are subject to review by the commissioner, and must be approved or denied within sixty days of submittal. A variation that is not denied within sixty days shall be deemed approved. The commissioner must provide to the carrier a detailed actuarial justification for any denial within thirty days of the denial.</p>

<p>Risk adjustment or reinsurance mechanisms may be used by the health insurance partnership program to redistribute funds to carriers participating in the health insurance partnership based on differences in risk attributable to individual choice of health plans or other factors unique to health insurance partnership participation. Use of such mechanisms shall be limited to the partnership program and will not affect small group health plans offered outside the partnership.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the rate developed under this section varies the adjusted community rate for the factors listed in (a) of this subsection, the date for determining those factors must be no more than ninety days prior to the effective date of the health benefit plan.</p>

<li>
<p>A health maintenance organization must offer coverage to all eligible employees of a small employer and their dependents. A health maintenance organization may not offer coverage to only certain individuals or dependents in a small employer group or to only part of the group.

<p>For the purposes of this chapter, a nonresident pharmacy is defined as any pharmacy located outside this state that ships, mails, or delivers, in any manner, except when delivered in person to an enrolled participant or his/her representative, controlled substances, legend drugs, or devices into this state.</p>
<p>After October 1, 1991, a health maintenance organization providing coverage of prescription drugs from nonresident pharmacies may only provide coverage from licensed nonresident pharmacies. The health maintenance organizations shall obtain proof of current licensure in conformity with this section and RCW 18.64.350 through 18.64.400 from the nonresident pharmacy and keep that proof of licensure on file.</p>
<p>The department may request from the health maintenance organization the proof of current licensure for all nonresident pharmacies through which the insurer is providing coverage for prescription drugs for residents of the state of Washington. This information, which may constitute a full or partial customer list, shall be confidential and exempt from public disclosure, and from the requirements of chapter 42.56 RCW. The board or the department shall not be restricted in the disclosure of the name of a nonresident pharmacy that is or has been licensed under RCW 18.64.360 or 18.64.370 or of the identity of a nonresident pharmacy disciplined under RCW 18.64.350 through 18.64.400.</p>
