## 66.36.010 - Places where liquor unlawfully kept declared a nuisance—Abatement of activity and realty—Judgment—Bond to reopen.
Any room, house, building, boat, vehicle, structure, or place, except premises licensed under this title, where liquor, as defined in this title, is manufactured, kept, sold, bartered, exchanged, given away, furnished, or otherwise disposed of in violation of the provisions of this title or of the laws of this state relating to the manufacture, importation, transportation, possession, distribution, and sale of liquor, and all property kept in and used in maintaining such a place, are hereby declared to be a common nuisance. The prosecuting attorney of the county in which such nuisance is situated shall institute and maintain an action in the superior court of such county in the name of the state of Washington to abate and perpetually enjoin such nuisance. The plaintiff shall not be required to give bond in such action, and restraining orders, temporary injunctions, and permanent injunctions may be granted in said cause as in other injunction proceedings, and upon final judgment against the defendant, such court may also order that said room, house, building, boat, vehicle, structure, or place, shall be closed for a period of one year; or until the owner, lessee, tenant, or occupant thereof shall give bond with sufficient surety, to be approved by the court making the order, in the penal sum of not less than one thousand dollars payable to the state of Washington, and conditioned that liquor will not thereafter be manufactured, kept, sold, bartered, exchanged, given away, furnished, or otherwise disposed of thereon or therein in violation of the provisions of this title or of the laws of this state relating to the manufacture, importation, transportation, possession, distribution, and sale of liquor, and that he or she will pay all fines, costs, and damages assessed against him or her for any violation of this title or of the laws of this state relating to the manufacture, importation, transportation, possession, distribution, and sale of liquor. If any condition of such bond be violated, the whole amount may be recovered as a penalty for the use of the county wherein the premises are situated.

In all cases where any person has been convicted of a violation of this title or the laws of this state relating to the manufacture, importation, transportation, possession, distribution, and sale of liquor an action may be brought in the superior court of the county in which the premises are situated, to abate as a nuisance any real estate or other property involved in the commission of said offense, and in any such action a certified copy of the record of such conviction shall be admissible in evidence and prima facie evidence that the room, house, building, boat, vehicle, structure, or place against which such action is brought is a public nuisance.
