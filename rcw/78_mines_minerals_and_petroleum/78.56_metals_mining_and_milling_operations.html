<p>It is in the best interests of the citizens of the state of Washington to insure the highest degree of environmental protection while allowing the proper development and use of its natural resources, including its mineral resources. Metals mining can have significant positive and adverse impacts on the state and on local communities. The purpose of this chapter is to assure that metals mineral mining or milling operations are designed, constructed, and operated in a manner that promotes both economic opportunities and environmental and public health safeguards for the citizens of the state. It is the intent of the legislature to create a regulatory framework which yields, to the greatest extent possible, a metals mining industry that is compatible with these policies.</p>

<li>
<p>In order to receive a waste discharge permit from the department of ecology pursuant to the requirements of chapter 90.48 RCW or in order to operate a metals mining and milling tailing facility, an applicant proposing a metals mining and milling operation regulated under this chapter must meet the following additional requirements:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Any tailings facility shall be designed and operated to prevent the release of pollution and must meet the following standards:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Operators shall apply all known available and reasonable technology to limit the concentration of potentially toxic materials in the tailings facility to assure the protection of wildlife and human health;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tailings facility shall have a containment system that includes an engineered liner system, leak detection and leak collection elements, and a seepage collection impoundment to assure that a leak of any regulated substance under chapter 90.48 RCW will be detected before escaping from the containment system. The design and management of the facility must ensure that any leaks from the tailings facility are detected in a manner which allows for remediation pursuant to chapter 90.48 RCW. The applicant shall prepare a detailed engineering report setting forth the facility design and construction. The applicant shall submit the report to the department of ecology for its review and approval of a design as determined by the department. Natural conditions, such as depth to groundwater or net rainfall, shall be taken into account in the facility design, but not in lieu of the protection required by the engineered liner system;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The toxicity of mine or mill tailings and the potential for long-term release of regulated substances from mine or mill tailings shall be reduced to the greatest extent practicable through stabilization, removal, or reuse of the substances; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The closure of the tailings facility shall provide for isolation or containment of potentially toxic materials and shall be designed to prevent future release of regulated substances contained in the impoundment;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The applicant must develop a waste rock management plan approved by the department of ecology and the department of natural resources which emphasizes pollution prevention. At a minimum, the plan must contain the following elements:</p>

<p>If an interested citizen or citizen group so requests of the department of ecology, the metals mining and milling operator or applicant shall work with the department of ecology and the interested party to make arrangements for citizen observation and verification in the taking of required water samples. While it is the intent of this subsection to provide for citizen observation and verification of water sampling activities, it is not the intent of this subsection to require additional water sampling and analysis on the part of the mining and milling operation or the department. The citizen observation and verification program shall be incorporated into the applicant's, operator's, or department's normal sampling regimen and shall occur at least once every six months. There is no duty of care on the part of the state or its employees to any person who participates in the citizen observation and verification of water sampling under chapter 232, Laws of 1994 and the state and its employees shall be immune from any civil lawsuit based on any injuries to or claims made by any person as a result of that person's participation in such observation and verification of water sampling activities. The metals mining and milling operator or applicant shall not be liable for any injuries to or claims made by any person which result from that person coming onto the property of the metals mining and milling operator or applicant as an observer pursuant to chapter 232, Laws of 1994. The results from these and all other relevant water sampling activities shall be kept on file with the relevant county and shall be available for public inspection during normal working hours; and</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the construction and operation of large-scale metals mining and milling facilities may create new job opportunities and enhance local tax revenues. However, the legislature also finds that such operations may also result in new demands on public facilities owned and operated by local government entities, such as public streets and roads; publicly owned parks, open space, and recreation facilities; school facilities; and fire protection facilities in jurisdictions that are not part of a fire district. It is important for these economic impacts to be identified as part of any proposal for a large-scale metals mining and milling operation. It is then appropriate for the county legislative authority to balance expected revenues, including revenues derived from taxes paid by the owner of such an operation, and costs associated with the operation to determine to what degree any new costs require mitigation by the metals mining applicant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An applicant for a large-scale metals mining and milling operation regulated under this chapter must submit to the relevant county legislative authority an impact analysis describing the economic impact of the proposed mining operation on local governmental units. For the purposes of this section, a metals mining operation is large-scale if, in the construction or operation of the mine and the associated milling facility, the applicant and contractors at the site employ more than thirty-five persons during any consecutive six-month period. The relevant county is the county in which the mine and mill are to be sited, unless the economic impacts to local governmental units are projected to substantially affect more than one county. In that case, the impact plan must be submitted to the legislative authority of all affected counties. Local governmental units include counties, cities, towns, school districts, and special purpose districts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The economic impact analysis shall include at least the following information:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A timetable for development of the mining operation, including the opening date of the operation and the estimated closing date;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The estimated number of persons coming into the impacted area as a result of the development of the mining operation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An estimate of the increased capital and operating costs to local governmental units for providing services necessary as a result of the development of the mining operation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An estimate of the increased tax or other revenues accruing to local governmental units as a result of development of the mining and milling operation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county legislative authority of a county planning under chapter 36.70A RCW may assess impact fees under chapter 82.02 RCW to address economic impacts associated with development of the mining operation. The county legislative authority shall hold at least one public hearing on the economic impact analysis and any proposed mitigation measures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county legislative authority of a county which is not planning under chapter 36.70A RCW may negotiate with the applicant on a strategy to address economic impacts associated with development of the mining operation. The county legislative authority shall hold at least one public hearing on the economic impact analysis and any proposed mitigation measures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county legislative authority must approve or disapprove the impact analysis and any associated proposals from the applicant to address economic impacts to local governmental units resulting from development of the mining operation. If the applicant does not submit an adequate impact analysis to the relevant county legislative authority or if the county legislative authority does not find the applicant's proposals to be acceptable because of their failure to adequately mitigate adverse economic impacts, the county legislative authority shall refuse to issue any permits under its jurisdiction necessary for the construction or operation of the mine and associated mill.</p>

<p>The requirements established in this section apply to metals mining operations under construction or constructed after April 1, 1994.</p>
