<p>After the later of the expiration of the twenty-year period set forth in RCW 78.22.010 or two years after June 7, 1984, the surface owner may extinguish the mineral interest held by another person and acquire ownership of that interest by providing sixty days notice of intention to file a claim of abandonment and extinguishment of the mineral interest upon the current mineral interest owner.

The county treasurer shall supply the name and address of the current mineral interest owner as they appear on the county property tax records to the surface owner without charge. If the current mineral interest owner is unknown to the county treasurer, and the current mineral interest owner cannot be determined after due diligence, the surface owner may serve the notice upon the current mineral interest owner by publishing the notice at least once each week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county in which the property interest is located, and if there is no newspaper of general circulation in the county, then in a newspaper of general circulation published in an adjoining county, and if there is no such newspaper in an adjoining county, then in a newspaper of general circulation published at the capital of the state.</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A copy of the notice of intention to file a claim of abandonment and extinguishment and an affidavit of publication shall be submitted to the county auditor within fifteen days after the date of the last publication or the date service was perfected by personal service or registered mail on the current mineral interest owner.</p>
