<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the public-private transportation initiatives act created under chapter 47.46 RCW has not met the needs and expectations of the public or private sectors for the development of transportation projects. The legislature intends to phase out chapter 47.46 RCW coincident with the completion of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge - SR 16 public-private partnership. From July 24, 2005, this chapter will provide a more desirable and effective approach to developing transportation projects in partnership with the private sector by applying lessons learned from other states and from this state's ten-year experience with chapter 47.46 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the legislature's intent to achieve the following goals through the creation of this new approach to public-private partnerships:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>To provide a well-defined mechanism to facilitate the collaboration between public and private entities in transportation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To bring innovative thinking from the private sector and other states to bear on public projects within the state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide greater flexibility in achieving the transportation projects; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To allow for creative cost and risk sharing between the public and private partners.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends that the powers granted in this chapter to the commission or department are in addition to any powers granted under chapter 47.56 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is further the intent of the legislature that an expert review panel be established for each project developed under chapter 334, Laws of 2006. Expert review panels shall be responsible for reviewing selected proposals, analyzing and reviewing tentative agreements, and making recommendations to the governor and the transportation commission on the advisability of executing agreements under chapter 334, Laws of 2006.</p>

Financing may be considered for all or part of a proposed project. A project may be financed in whole or in part with:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The proceeds of grant anticipation revenue bonds authorized by 23 U.S.C. Sec. 122 and applicable state law. Legislative authorization and appropriation is required in order to use this source of financing;</p>

<li>
<p>Grants, loans, loan guarantees, lines of credit, revolving lines of credit, or other financing arrangements available under the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act under 23 U.S.C. Sec. 181 et seq., or any other applicable federal law;</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>As security for the payment of financing described in this section, the revenues from the project may be pledged, but no such pledge of revenues constitutes in any manner or to any extent a general obligation of the state. Any financing described in this section may be structured on a senior, parity, or subordinate basis to any other financing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For any transportation project developed under this chapter that is owned, leased, used, or operated by the state, as a public facility, if indebtedness is issued, it must be issued by the state treasurer for the transportation project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For other public projects defined in RCW 47.29.050(2) that are developed in conjunction with a transportation project, financing necessary to develop, construct, or operate the public project must be approved by the state finance committee or by the governing board of a public benefit corporation as provided in the federal Internal Revenue Code section 63-20;</p>
