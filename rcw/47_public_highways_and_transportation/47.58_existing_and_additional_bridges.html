<p>Whenever the legislature specifically authorizes, as a single project, the construction of an additional toll bridge, including approaches, and the reconstruction of an existing adjacent bridge, including approaches, and the imposition of tolls on both bridges, the department is authorized to enter into appropriate agreements whereunder the existing bridge or its approaches will be reconstructed and improved and an additional bridge, including approaches and connecting highways will be constructed as a part of the same project to be located adjacent to or within two miles of the existing bridge and will be financed through the issuance of revenue bonds of the same series. The department has the right to impose tolls for traffic over the existing bridge as well as the additional bridge for the purpose of paying the cost of operation and maintenance of the bridge or bridges and the interest on and creating a sinking fund for retirement of revenue bonds issued for account of such project, all in the manner permitted and provided by this chapter.</p>

<p>For the purpose of obtaining information as to the necessity of the reconstruction or improvement of any such bridge and the expediency of constructing any such additional bridge it is the duty of the department to make any examination, investigation, survey, or reconnaissance pertaining thereto. The cost of any such examination, investigation, survey, or reconnaissance, and all preliminary expenses in the issuance of any revenue bonds, making surveys and appraisals and drafting, printing, issuance, and sale of bonds under this chapter, shall be advanced by any interested municipality, agency, or department of the state of Washington. All such advancements shall be reimbursed out of any proceeds derived from the sale of bonds or out of tolls and revenues to be derived by the department through its operations hereunder for account of the project, as may be agreed upon between the department and the municipality, agency, or department.</p>

<p>Except as otherwise provided in RCW 47.56.850, the secretary shall have full charge of the construction of all such improvements and reconstruction work and the construction of any additional bridge, including approaches and connecting highways, that may be authorized under this chapter and the operation of such bridge or bridges, as well as the collection of tolls and other charges for services and facilities thereby afforded. The schedule of charges for the services and facilities shall be fixed and revised from time to time by the commission so that the tolls and revenues collected will yield annual revenue and income sufficient, after payment or allowance for all operating, maintenance, and repair expenses, to pay the interest on all revenue bonds outstanding under the provisions of this chapter for account of the project and to create a sinking fund for the retirement of the revenue bonds at or prior to maturity. The charges shall be continued until all such bonds and interest thereon and unpaid advancements, if any, have been paid.</p>

<p>For the purpose of paying the cost of all or any part of the improvement and reconstruction work and the construction of any additional bridge, approaches thereto, and connecting highways, the department is hereby authorized by resolution to issue its revenue bonds which shall constitute obligations only of the department and shall be payable from any funds available except revenue from the general fund, including but not limited to the revenues and income from the operation of the bridge or bridges constituting the project as may be provided in and by such resolution. Each such revenue bond shall contain a recital that payment or redemption of the bond and payment of the interest thereon is secured by a direct charge and lien upon the tolls and revenues pledged for that purpose and that such bond does not constitute an indebtedness of the state of Washington. Such revenue bonds may bear such date or dates, may mature at such time or times as the department shall determine, may bear interest at such rate or rates, may be in such denomination or denominations, may be in such form, either coupon or registered, may carry such registration and conversion privileges, may be made subject to such terms of redemption with or without premium, and may contain such other terms and covenants not inconsistent with this chapter as may be provided in such resolution. Notwithstanding the form or tenor of the bond, and in the absence of an express recital on its face that the bond is nonnegotiable, each such revenue bond shall at all times be and shall be treated as a negotiable instrument for all purposes. All such bonds shall be signed by the state treasurer and countersigned by the governor, and any interest coupons appertaining thereto shall bear the signature of the state treasurer. The countersignature of the governor on the bonds and the signature of the state treasurer on the coupons may be their printed or lithographed facsimile signatures. Pending the issuance of definitive bonds, temporary or interim bonds, certificates, or receipts of any denomination and with or without coupons attached may be issued as may be provided by the resolution. All bonds issued under or by authority of this chapter shall be sold to the highest and best bidder at such price or prices, at such rate or rates of interest, and after such advertising for bids as the department may deem proper, but it may reject any and all bids so submitted and thereafter sell the bonds so advertised under such terms and conditions as it deems advantageous. The purchase price of all bonds issued hereunder shall be paid to the state treasurer consistent with the provisions of the resolution pursuant to which the bonds have been issued or to the trustee designated in the bond resolution and held as a separate trust fund to be disbursed on the orders of the department.</p>
