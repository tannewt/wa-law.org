<p>The governing body of each municipal corporation shall classify and designate city streets as follows:</p>
<p>Major arterials, which are defined as transportation arteries which connect the focal points of traffic interest within a city; arteries which provide communications with other communities and the outlying areas; or arteries which have relatively high traffic volume compared with other streets within the city;</p>
<p>Secondary arterials, which are defined as routes which serve lesser points of traffic interest within a city; provide communication with outlying districts in the same degree or serve to collect and distribute traffic from the major arterials to the local streets;</p>
<p>Access streets, which are defined as land service streets and are generally limited to providing access to abutting property. They are tributary to the major and secondary thoroughfares and generally discourage through traffic.</p>

<p>Any city or town may use any funds available for street or road construction, maintenance, or improvement for building, improving, and maintaining a pedestrian right-of-way and for improvements to make existing streets and roads more suitable and safe for pedestrian travel. Any such paths, lanes, roadways, routes, or streets for which any such street or road funds are expended must be suitable for pedestrian travel purposes and not solely for recreation purposes. A pedestrian right-of-way constructed or modified after December 31, 2012, must meet or exceed the standards adopted by the design standards committee under RCW 35.78.030.</p>
