<p>It is hereby declared: (1) That there exist in the state insanitary or unsafe dwelling accommodations and that persons of low income are forced to reside in such insanitary or unsafe accommodations; that within the state there is a shortage of safe or sanitary dwelling accommodations available at rents which persons of low income can afford and that such persons are forced to occupy overcrowded and congested dwelling accommodations; that the aforesaid conditions cause an increase in and spread of disease and crime and constitute a menace to the health, safety, morals and welfare of the residents of the state and impair economic values; that these conditions necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for crime prevention and punishment, public health and safety, fire and accident protection, and other public services and facilities; (2) that these areas in the state cannot be cleared, nor can the shortage of safe and sanitary dwellings for persons of low income be relieved, through the operation of private enterprise, and that the construction of housing projects for persons of low income (as herein defined) would therefore not be competitive with private enterprise; (3) that the clearance, replanning and reconstruction of the areas in which insanitary or unsafe housing conditions exist and the providing of safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations for persons of low income are public uses and purposes for which public money may be spent and private property acquired and are governmental functions of state concern; (4) that it is in the public interest that work on projects for such purposes be commenced as soon as possible in order to relieve unemployment which now (1939) constitutes an emergency; and the necessity in the public interest for the provisions hereinafter enacted, is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.</p>

<p>In each city (as herein defined) and in each county of the state there is hereby created a public body corporate and politic to be known as the &quot;Housing Authority&quot; of the city or county: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That such authority shall not transact any business or exercise its powers hereunder until or unless the governing body of the city or the county, as the case may be, by proper resolution shall declare at any time hereafter that there is need for an authority to function in such city or county. The determination as to whether or not there is such need for an authority to function (1) may be made by the governing body on its own motion or (2) shall be made by the governing body upon the filing of a petition signed by twenty-five residents of the city or county, as the case may be, asserting that there is need for an authority to function in such city or county and requesting that the governing body so declare.</p>
<p>The governing body shall adopt a resolution declaring that there is need for a housing authority in the city or county, as the case may be, if it shall find (1) that insanitary or unsafe inhabited dwelling accommodations exist in such city or county; (2) that there is a shortage of safe or sanitary dwelling accommodations in such city or county available to persons of low income at rentals they can afford; or (3) that there is a shortage of safe or sanitary dwellings, apartments, mobile home parks, or other living accommodations available for senior citizens. In determining whether dwelling accommodations are unsafe or insanitary said governing body may take into consideration the degree of overcrowding, the percentage of land coverage, the light, air, space and access available to the inhabitants of such dwelling accommodations, the size and arrangement of the rooms, the sanitary facilities, and the extent to which conditions exist in such buildings which endanger life or property by fire or other causes.</p>
<p>In any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of or relating to any contract of the authority, the authority shall be conclusively deemed to have become established and authorized to transact business and exercise its powers hereunder upon proof of the adoption of a resolution by the governing body declaring the need for the authority. Such resolution or resolutions shall be deemed sufficient if it declares that there is such need for an authority and finds in substantially the foregoing terms (no further detail being necessary) that either or both of the above enumerated conditions exist in the city or county, as the case may be. A copy of such resolution duly certified by the clerk shall be admissible in evidence in any suit, action or proceeding.</p>

<p>Except as provided in RCW 35.82.045, when the governing body of a city adopts a resolution declaring that there is a need for a housing authority, it shall promptly notify the mayor of such adoption. Upon receiving such notice, the mayor shall appoint five persons as commissioners of the authority created for the city. When the governing body of a county adopts a resolution declaring that there is a need for a housing authority, it shall appoint five persons as commissioners of the authority created for the county. The commissioners who are first appointed shall be designated to serve for terms of one, two, three, four and five years, respectively, from the date of their appointment, but thereafter commissioners shall be appointed for a term of office of five years except that all vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term. No commissioner of an authority may be an officer or employee of the city or county for which the authority is created, unless the commissioner is an employee of a separately elected county official other than the county governing body in a county with a population of less than one hundred seventy-five thousand as of the 1990 federal census, and the total government employment in that county exceeds forty percent of total employment. A commissioner shall hold office until a successor has been appointed and has qualified, unless sooner removed according to this chapter. A certificate of the appointment or reappointment of any commissioner shall be filed with the clerk and such certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the due and proper appointment of such commissioner. A commissioner shall receive no compensation for his or her services for the authority, in any capacity, but he or she shall be entitled to the necessary expenses, including traveling expenses, incurred in the discharge of his or her duties.</p>
<p>The powers of each authority shall be vested in the commissioners thereof in office from time to time. Except as provided in RCW 35.82.045, three commissioners shall constitute a quorum of the authority for the purpose of conducting its business and exercising its powers and for all other purposes. Action may be taken by the authority upon a vote of a majority of the commissioners present, unless in any case the bylaws of the authority shall require a larger number. The mayor (or in the case of an authority for a county, the governing body of the county) shall designate which of the commissioners appointed shall be the first chair of the commission and he or she shall serve in the capacity of chair until the expiration of his or her term of office as commissioner. When the office of the chair of the authority becomes vacant, the authority shall select a chair from among its commissioners. An authority shall select from among its commissioners a vice chair, and it may employ a secretary (who shall be executive director), technical experts and such other officers, agents and employees, permanent and temporary, as it may require, and shall determine their qualifications, duties and compensation. For such legal services as it may require, an authority may call upon the chief law officer of the city or the county or may employ its own counsel and legal staff. An authority may delegate to one or more of its agents or employees such powers or duties as it may deem proper.</p>
<p>If federal law requires that the membership of the board of commissioners of a local authority contains one member who is directly assisted by the authority, the board may by resolution temporarily or permanently increase its size to six members. The board may determine the length of the term of the position filled by a directly assisted member. A person appointed to such a position may serve in that position only as long as he or she is directly assisted by the authority.</p>

<p>An authority shall have power to issue bonds from time to time in its discretion, for any of its corporate purposes. An authority shall also have power to issue refunding bonds for the purpose of paying or retiring bonds previously issued by it. An authority may issue such types of bonds as it may determine, including (without limiting the generality of the foregoing) bonds on which the principal and interest are payable: (1) Exclusively from the income and revenues of the housing project financed with the proceeds of such bonds; (2) exclusively from the income and revenues of certain designated housing projects whether or not they are financed in whole or in part with the proceeds of such bonds; or (3) from all or part of its revenues or assets generally. Any such bonds may be additionally secured by a pledge of any grant or contributions from the federal government or other source, or a pledge of any income or revenues of the authority, or a mortgage of any housing project, projects or other property of the authority. Any pledge made by the authority shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made; the revenues, moneys, or property so pledged and thereafter received by the authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the authority, irrespective or whether the parties have notice thereof.</p>
<p>Neither the commissioners of an authority nor any person executing the bonds shall be liable personally on the bonds by reason of the issuance thereof. The bonds and other obligations of an authority (and such bonds and obligations shall so state on their face) shall not be a debt of the city, the county, the state or any political subdivision thereof and neither the city or the county, nor the state or any political subdivision thereof shall be liable thereon, nor in any event shall such bonds or obligations be payable out of any funds or properties other than those of the authority. The bonds shall not constitute an indebtedness within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt limitation or restriction. Bonds of an authority are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose and to be public instrumentalities and, together with interest thereon and income therefrom, shall be exempt from taxes. Nothing in this section shall prevent an authority from issuing bonds the interest on which is included in gross income of the owners thereof for income tax purposes.</p>

<p>Activation or reactivation of a housing authority or joint housing authority by each of the cities and counties that previously authorized the joint housing authority and any additional cities or counties that are then to be added.

<li>
<p>Distribution of all assets, obligations, and liabilities of the joint housing authority to the housing authorities activated or reactivated under (a) of this subsection. Distribution of assets, obligations, and liabilities may be based on any, or a combination of any of, the following considerations:</p>

<li>
<p>The population within the boundaries of each of the housing authorities activated or reactivated under (a) of this subsection;</p>

<p>Each activated or reactivated housing authority shall be responsible for debt service on bonds or other obligations issued or incurred to finance the acquisition, construction, or improvement of the projects, properties, and other assets that have been distributed to them under the dissolution. However, if an outstanding bond issue is secured in whole or in part by the general revenues of the joint housing authority being dissolved, each housing authority activated or reactivated under subsection (2)(a) of this section shall remain jointly and severally liable for retirement of debt service through repayment of those outstanding bonds and other obligations of the joint housing authority until paid or defeased, from general revenues of each of the activated or reactivated housing authorities, and from any other revenues and accounts that had been expressly pledged by the joint housing authority to the payment of those bonds or other obligations. As used in this subsection, &quot;general revenues&quot; means all revenues of a housing authority from any source, but only to the extent that those revenues are available to pay debt service on bonds or other obligations and are not then or thereafter pledged or restricted by law, regulation, contract, covenant, resolution, deed of trust, or otherwise, solely to another particular purpose.</p>
