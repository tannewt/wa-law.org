<p>Every city and town may erect and maintain drawbridges across navigable streams that flow through or penetrate the boundaries thereof, when the public necessity requires it, or it may grant franchises to persons or corporations to erect them and charge toll thereon.</p>

<p>All bridges constructed under the provisions of this chapter must be so constructed as not to obstruct navigation, and must have a draw or swing of sufficient space or span to permit the safe, convenient, and expeditious passage at all times of any steamer or vessel or raft which may navigate the stream or waters bridged.</p>

<p>A city or town may build and maintain toll bridges and charge and collect tolls thereon, and to that end may provide a system and elect or appoint persons to operate the same, or the said bridges may be made free, as it may elect.</p>
<p>Consistent with RCW 47.56.850, any toll proposed under this section, including any change in an existing toll rate, must first be reviewed and approved by the tolling authority designated in RCW 47.56.850 if the toll, or change in toll rate, would have a significant impact, as determined by the tolling authority, on the operation of any state facility.</p>

<p>Before any franchise to build any bridge across any such navigable stream is granted by any city or town council it shall fix a license tax, not to exceed ten percent of the tolls collected annually.
