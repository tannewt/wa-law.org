<p>Every authority has the following powers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To acquire by purchase, condemnation, gift, or grant and to lease, construct, add to, improve, replace, repair, maintain, operate, and regulate the use of public monorail transportation facilities, including passenger terminal and parking facilities and properties, and other facilities and properties as may be necessary for passenger and vehicular access to and from public monorail transportation facilities, together with all lands, rights-of-way, and property within or outside the authority area, and together with equipment and accessories necessary or appropriate for these facilities, except that property, including but not limited to other types of public transportation facilities, that is owned by any city, county, county transportation authority, public transportation benefit area, metropolitan municipal corporation, or regional transit authority may be acquired or used by an authority only with the consent of the public entity owning the property. The entities are authorized to convey or lease property to an authority or to contract for their joint use on terms fixed by agreement between the entity and the authority;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To fix rates, tolls, fares, and charges for the use of facilities and to establish various routes and classes of service. Rates, tolls, fares, or charges may be adjusted or eliminated for any distinguishable class of users including, but not limited to, senior citizens and persons with disabilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To contract with the United States or any of its agencies, any state or any of its agencies, any metropolitan municipal corporation, and other country, city, other political subdivision or governmental instrumentality, or governmental agency, or any private person, firm, or corporation for the purpose of receiving any gifts or grants or securing loans or advances for preliminary planning and feasibility studies, or for the design, construction, operation, or maintenance of public monorail transportation facilities as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding the provisions of any law to the contrary, and in addition to any other authority provided by law, the governing body of a city transportation authority may contract with one or more vendors for the design, construction, operation, or maintenance, or other service related to the development of a monorail public transportation system including, but not limited to, monorail trains, operating systems and control equipment, guideways, and pylons, together with the necessary passenger stations, terminals, parking facilities, and other related facilities necessary and appropriate for passenger and vehicular access to and from the monorail train.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the governing body of the city transportation authority decides to proceed with the consideration of qualifications or proposals for services from qualified vendors, the authority must publish notice of its requirements and request submission of qualifications statements or proposals. The notice must be published in the official newspaper of the city creating the authority at least once a week for two weeks, not less than sixty days before the final date for the submission of qualifications statements or proposals. The notice must state in summary form: (i) The general scope and nature of the design, construction, operation, maintenance, or other services being sought related to the development of the proposed monorail, tram, or trolley public transportation system; (ii) the name and address of a representative of the city transportation authority who can provide further details; (iii) the final date for the submission of qualifications statements or proposals; (iv) an estimated schedule for the consideration of qualifications statements or proposals, the selection of vendors, and the negotiation of a contract or contracts for services; (v) the location of which a copy of any requests for qualifications statements or requests for proposals will be made available; and (vi) the criteria established by the governing body of the authority to select a vendor or vendors, which may include, but is not limited to, the vendor's prior experience, including design, construction, operation, or maintenance of other similar public transportation facilities, respondent's management capabilities, proposed project schedule, availability and financial resources, costs of the services to be provided, nature of facility design proposed by the vendors, system reliability, performance standards required for the facilities, compatibility with existing public transportation facilities operated by the authority or any other public body or other providers of similar services to the public, project performance guarantees, penalties, and other enforcement provisions, environmental protection measures to be used by the vendor, consistency with the applicable regional transportation plans, and the proposed allocation of project risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the governing body of the city transportation authority decides to proceed with the consideration of qualifications statements or proposals submitted by vendors, it may designate a representative to evaluate the vendors who submitted qualifications statements or proposals and conduct discussions regarding qualifications or proposals with one or more vendors. The governing body or its representative may request submission of qualifications statements and may later request more detailed proposals from one or more vendors who have submitted qualifications statements, or may request detailed proposals without having first received and evaluated qualifications statements. The governing body or its representative will evaluate the qualifications or proposals, as applicable. If two or more vendors submit qualifications or proposals that meet the criteria established by the governing body of the authority, discussions and interviews must be held with at least two vendors. Any revisions to a request for qualifications or request for proposals must be made available to all vendors then under consideration by the governing body of the authority and must be made available to any other person who has requested receipt of that information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the criteria established by the governing body of the authority, the representative will recommend to the governing body a vendor or vendors that are initially determined to be the best qualified to provide one or more of the design, construction, operation or maintenance, or other service related to the development of the proposed monorail public transportation system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The governing body of the authority or its representative may attempt to negotiate a contract with the vendor or vendors selected for one or more of the design, construction, operation or maintenance, or other service related to the development of the proposed monorail public transportation system on terms that the governing body of the authority determines to be fair and reasonable and in the best interest of the authority. If the governing body, or its representative, is unable to negotiate a contract with any one or more of the vendors first selected on terms that it determines to be fair and reasonable and in the best interest of the authority, negotiations with any one or more of the vendors must be terminated or suspended and another qualified vendor or vendors may be selected in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section. If the governing body decides to continue the process of selection, negotiations will continue with a qualified vendor or vendors in accordance with this section at the sole discretion of the governing body of the authority until an agreement is reached with one or more qualified vendors, or the process is terminated by the governing body. The process may be repeated until an agreement is reached.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to entering into a contract with a vendor, the governing body of the authority must make written findings, after holding a public hearing on the proposal, that it is in the public interest to enter into the contract, that the contract is financially sound, and that it is advantageous for the governing body of the authority to use this method for awarding contracts for one or more of the design, construction, or operation or maintenance of the proposed monorail public transportation system as compared to all other methods of awarding such contracts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each contract must include a project performance bond or bonds or other security by the vendor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provisions of chapters 39.12 and 39.19 RCW apply to a contract entered into under this section as if the public transportation systems and facilities were owned by a public body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vendor selection process permitted by this section is supplemental to and is not construed as a repeal of or limitation on any other authority granted by law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contracts for the construction of facilities, other than contracts for facilities to be provided by the selected vendor, with an estimated cost greater than two hundred thousand dollars must be awarded after a competitive bid process consistent with chapter 39.04 RCW or awarded through an alternative public works contracting procedure consistent with chapter 39.10 RCW;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To contract with the United States or any of its agencies, any state or any of its agencies, any metropolitan municipal corporation, any other county, city, other political subdivision or governmental instrumentality, any governmental agency, or any private person, firm, or corporation for the use by either contracting party of all or any part of the facilities, structures, lands, interests in lands, air rights over lands, and rights-of-way of all kinds which are owned, leased, or held by the other party and for the purpose of planning, designing, constructing, operating any public transportation facility, or performing any service related to transportation which the authority is authorized to operate or perform, on terms as may be agreed upon by the contracting parties;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To acquire any existing public transportation facility by conveyance, sale, or lease. In any acquisition from a county, city, or other political subdivision of the state, the authority will receive credit from the county or city or other political subdivision for any federal assistance and state matching assistance used by the county or city or other political subdivision in acquiring any portion of the public transportation facility. Upon acquisition, the authority must assume and observe all existing labor contracts relating to the public transportation facility and, to the extent necessary for operation of the public transportation facility, all of the employees of the public transportation facility whose duties are necessary to efficiently operate the public transportation facility must be appointed to comparable positions to those which they held at the time of the transfer, and no employee or retired or pensioned employee of the public transportation facility will be placed in any worse position with respect to pension seniority, wages, sick leave, vacation, or other benefits than he or she enjoyed as an employee of the public transportation facility prior to the acquisition. Furthermore, the authority must engage in collective bargaining with the duly appointed representatives of any employee labor organization having existing contracts with the acquired facility and may enter into labor contracts with the employee labor organization;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To contract for, participate in, and support research, demonstration, testing, and development of public monorail transportation facilities, equipment, and use incentives, and have all powers necessary to comply with any criteria, standards, and regulations which may be adopted under state and federal law, and to take all actions necessary to meet the requirements of those laws. The authority has, in addition to these powers, the authority to prepare, adopt, and carry out a comprehensive public monorail plan and to make other plans and studies and to perform programs as the authority deems necessary to implement and comply with those laws;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To establish local improvement districts within the authority area to finance public monorail transportation facilities, to levy special assessments on property specially benefited by those facilities, and to issue local improvement bonds to be repaid by the collection of local improvement assessments. The method of establishment, levying, collection, enforcement, and all other matters relating to the local improvement districts, assessments, collection, and bonds are as provided in the statutes governing local improvement districts of cities and towns. The duties devolving upon the city treasurer in those statutes are imposed on the treasurer of the authority;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To exercise all other powers necessary and appropriate to carry out its responsibilities, including without limitation the power to sue and be sued, to own, construct, purchase, lease, add to, and maintain any real and personal property or property rights necessary for the conduct of the affairs of the authority, to enter into contracts, and to employ the persons as the authority deems appropriate. An authority may also sell, lease, convey, or otherwise dispose of any real or personal property no longer necessary for the conduct of the affairs of the authority.</p>

Before utilization of any excise tax money collected under this section for acquisition of right-of-way or construction of a public monorail transportation facility on a separate right-of-way, the authority must adopt rules affording the public an opportunity for corridor public hearings and design public hearings, which provide in detail the procedures necessary for public participation in the following instances: (a) Prior to adoption of location and design plans having a substantial social, economic, or environmental effect upon the locality upon which they are to be constructed; or (b) on the public transportation facilities operating on a separate right-of-way whenever a substantial change is proposed relating to location or design in the adopted plan. In adopting rules the authority must adhere to the provisions of the administrative procedure act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A &quot;corridor public hearing&quot; is a public hearing that: (a) Is held before the authority is committed to a specific route proposal for the public transportation facility, and before a route location is established; (b) is held to afford an opportunity for participation by those interested in the determination of the need for, and the location of, the public transportation facility; and (c) provides a public forum that affords a full opportunity for presenting views on the public transportation facility route location, and the social, economic, and environmental effects on that location and alternate locations. However, the hearing is not deemed to be necessary before adoption of a transportation plan as provided in *section 7 of this act or a vote of the qualified electors under subsection (5) of this section.</p>

The rate of tax must not exceed 1.944 percent of the base of the tax. The base of the tax will be the selling price in the case of a sales tax or the rental value of the vehicle used in the case of a use tax.

<ol>
<li>
<p>Every authority has the power to impose annual regular property tax levies in an amount equal to one dollar and fifty cents or less per thousand dollars of assessed value of property in the authority area when specifically authorized to do so by a majority of the voters voting on a proposition submitted at a special election or at the regular election of the authority. A proposition authorizing the tax levies will not be submitted by an authority more than twice in any twelve-month period. Ballot propositions must conform with RCW 29A.36.210. The number of years during which the regular levy will be imposed may be limited as specified in the ballot proposition or may be unlimited in duration. In the event an authority is levying property taxes, which in combination with property taxes levied by other taxing districts subject to the limitations provided in RCW 84.52.043 and 84.52.050, exceed these limitations, the authority's property tax levy shall be reduced or eliminated consistent with RCW 84.52.010.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The limitation in RCW 84.55.010 does not apply to the first levy imposed under this section following the approval of the levies by the voters under subsection (1) of this section.</p>

<p>All taxes and fees levied and collected by an authority must be used solely for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of acquiring, designing, constructing, equipping, maintaining, or operating public monorail transportation facilities or contracting for the services thereof, or to pay or secure the payment of all or part of the principal of or interest on any general obligation bonds or revenue bonds issued for authority purposes. Until expended, money accumulated in the funds and accounts of an authority may be invested in the manner authorized by the governing body of the authority, consistent with state law.</p>
<p>If any of the revenue from any tax or fee authorized to be levied by an authority has been pledged by the authority to secure the payment of any bonds as herein authorized, then as long as that pledge is in effect the legislature will not withdraw from the authority the authorization to levy and collect the tax or fee.</p>

<ol>
<li>Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the city transportation authority may be dissolved by a vote of the people residing within the boundaries of the authority if the authority is faced with significant financial problems. However, the authority may covenant with holders of its bonds that it may not be dissolved and shall continue to exist solely for the purpose of continuing to levy and collect any taxes or assessments levied by it and pledged to the repayment of debt and to take other actions, including the appointment of a trustee, as necessary to allow it to repay any remaining debt. No such debt may be incurred by the authority on a project until thirty days after a final environmental impact statement on that project has been issued as required by chapter 43.21C RCW. The amount of the authority's initial bond issue is limited to the amount of the project costs in the subsequent two years as documented by a certified engineer or by submitted bids, plus any reimbursable capital expenses already incurred at the time of the bond issue. The authority may size the first bond issue consistent with the internal revenue service five-year spend down schedule if an independent financial advisor recommends such an approach is financially advisable. Any referendum petition to dissolve the city transportation authority must be filed with the city council and contain provisions for dissolution of the authority. Within seven days, the city prosecutor must review the validity of the petition and submit its report to the petitioner and city council. If the petitioner's claims are deemed valid by the city prosecutor, within ten days of the petitioner's filing, the city council will confer with the petitioner concerning the form and style of the petition, issue an identification number for the petition, and write a ballot title for the measure. The ballot title must be posed as a question and an affirmative vote on the measure results in authority retention and a negative vote on the measure results in the authority's dissolution. The petitioner will be notified of the identification number and ballot title within this ten-day period.</li>
</ol>
<p>After this notification, the petitioner has ninety days in which to secure on petition forms, the signatures of not less than fifteen percent of the registered voters in the authority area and to file the signed petitions with the filing officer. Each petition form must contain the ballot title and the full text of the measure to be referred. The filing officer will verify the sufficiency of the signatures on the petitions. If sufficient valid signatures are properly submitted, the filing officer shall submit the initiative to the authority area voters at a general or special election held on one of the dates provided in RCW 29A.04.321 as determined by the city council, which election will not take place later than one hundred twenty days after the signed petition has been filed with the filing officer.</p>

<p>Each authority shall incorporate in plans for stations along any monorail project signing that is easily understood by the traveling public, including, but not limited to, persons with disabilities, non-English-speaking persons, and visitors from other nations. The signage must employ graphics consistent with international symbols for transportation facilities and signage that are consistent with department of transportation guidelines and programs. The signage must also use distinguishing pictograms as a means to identify stations and points of interest along the monorail corridor for persons who use languages that are not Roman-alphabet based. These requirements are intended to apply to new sign installation and not to existing signs. The authority may replace existing signs as it chooses; however, it shall use the new signing designs when existing signs are replaced. All signage must comply with requirements of applicable federal law and may include recommendations contained in federal publications providing directions on way-finding for persons with disabilities.</p>
