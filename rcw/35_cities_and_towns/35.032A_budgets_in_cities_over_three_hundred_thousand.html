The estimated revenues shall include sources previously established by law and unencumbered fund balances estimated to be available at the close of the current fiscal year.

<p>Every city having a population of over three hundred thousand may maintain an emergency fund, which fund balance shall not exceed thirty-seven and one-half cents per thousand dollars of assessed value.

<li>
<p>For the immediate preservation of order or public health or for the restoration to a condition of usefulness of public property the usefulness of which has been destroyed by accident; or</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>To meet mandatory expenditures required by laws enacted since the last budget was adopted.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The city council by an ordinance approved by three-fourths of all its members may appropriate from the emergency fund, or other designated funds, an amount sufficient to meet the actual necessary expenditures of the city for which insufficient or no appropriations have been made due to causes which could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of the making of the budget.</p>
<p>An ordinance authorizing an emergency expenditure shall become effective immediately upon being approved by the mayor or upon being passed over his or her veto as provided by the city charter.</p>
