<p>If, in the judgment of the city council the special benefits for any such improvement shall extend beyond the boundaries of the filled area, the council may create an enlarged district which shall include, as near as may be, all the property, whether actually filled or not, which will be specially benefited by such improvement, and in such case the council shall specify and describe the boundaries of such enlarged district in the ordinance providing for such improvement and shall specify that such portion of the total cost and expense of such improvement as may not be borne by the current or general expense fund, shall be distributed and assessed against all the property of such enlarged district.</p>

<p>The filling of unimproved and uncultivated lowlands of the character mentioned in RCW 35.55.010 shall not be considered as damaging or taking of such lands.

If the improvement is to be made at the expense of the property benefited, no account shall be taken of benefits by the jury or court in assessing the amount of compensation to be made to the owner of any property within such district, but such compensation shall be assessed without regard to benefits to the end that said property for which damages may be so awarded, may be assessed the same as other property within the district for its just share and proportion of the expense of making said improvement, and the fact that compensation has been awarded for the damaging or taking of any parcel of land shall not preclude the assessment of such parcel of land for its just proportion of said improvement.</p>

<p>When so ordered by the council, the entire amount of compensation paid or to be paid for property damaged or taken, including all of the costs and expenses incidental to the condemnation proceedings together with the entire cost and expense of making the improvement, may be assessed against the property within the district subject to assessment, but the council may order any portion of the costs paid out of the current or general expense fund of the city.</p>

<p>The cost and expense incidental to the filling of the streets, alleys and public places within such assessment district shall be borne by the private property within such district subject to assessment when so ordered by the council.

<p>If money accumulates in an improvement fund and is likely to lie idle awaiting the maturity of the bonds against the district, the city council, under proper safeguards, may invest it temporarily, or may borrow it temporarily, at a reasonable rate of interest, but when so invested or borrowed, the city shall be responsible and liable for the restoration to such fund of the money so invested or borrowed with interest thereon, whenever required for the redemption of bonds maturing against such district.</p>

<p>The contract for the making of the improvement may be let either before or after the making up of the equalization of the assessment roll, and warrants, or bonds may be issued against the local improvement district fund either before or after the equalization of the roll as in the judgment of the council may best subserve the public interest.</p>
<p>If, after the assessment roll is made up and equalized, based in whole or in part upon an estimate of the cost of the improvement, and it is found that the estimate was too high, the excess shall be rebated pro rata to the property owners on the assessment roll, the rebates to be deducted from the last installment, or installments, when the assessment is upon the installment plan.</p>
<p>If it is found that the estimated cost was too low and that the actual bona fide cost of the improvement is greater than the estimate, the city council, after due notice and a hearing, as in case of the original equalization of the roll, may add the required additional amount to the assessment roll to be apportioned among the several parcels of property upon the same rules and principles as if it had been originally included, except that the additional amount shall be added to the last installment of an assessment if assessments are payable upon the installment plan. The same notice shall be required for adding to the assessment roll in this manner as is required for the original equalization of the roll, and the property owner shall have the right of appeal.</p>
