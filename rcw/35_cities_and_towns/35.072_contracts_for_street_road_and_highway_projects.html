<p>Street projects subject to reimbursement may include design, grading, paving, installation of curbs, gutters, storm drainage, sidewalks, street lighting, traffic controls, and other similar improvements, as required by the street standards of the city, town, or county.</p>

<p>The contract may provide for an extension of the fifteen-year reimbursement period for a time not to exceed the duration of any moratorium, phasing ordinance, concurrency designation, or other governmental action that prevents making applications for, or the approval of, any new development within the benefit area for a period of six months or more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon the extension of the reimbursement period pursuant to (a) of this subsection, the contract must specify the duration of the contract extension and must be filed and recorded with the county auditor. Property owners who are subject to the reimbursement obligations under subsection (1) of this section shall be notified by the appropriate county, city, or town of the extension filed under this subsection.</p>

If the property owner fails to comply with the notification requirements of this subsection within sixty days of the specified time, then the contracting county, city, or town may collect any reimbursement funds owed to the property owner under the contract.

<p>The procedures for assessment reimbursement contracts shall be governed by the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An assessment reimbursement area shall be formulated by the city, town, or county based upon a determination by the city, town, or county of which parcels adjacent to the improvements would require similar street improvements upon development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The preliminary determination of area boundaries and assessments, along with a description of the property owners' rights and options, shall be forwarded by certified mail to the property owners of record within the proposed assessment area. If any property owner requests a hearing in writing within twenty days of the mailing of the preliminary determination, a hearing shall be held before the legislative body, notice of which shall be given to all affected property owners. The legislative body's ruling is determinative and final.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The contract must be recorded in the appropriate county auditor's office within thirty days of the final execution of the agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the contract is so filed, it shall be binding on owners of record within the assessment area who are not party to the contract.</p>

<li>
<p>As an alternative to financing projects under this chapter solely by owners of real estate, a county, city, or town may join in the financing of improvement projects and may be reimbursed in the same manner as the owners of real estate who participate in the projects, if the county, city, or town has specified the conditions of its participation in an ordinance. As another alternative, a county, city, or town may create an assessment reimbursement area on its own initiative, without the participation of a private property owner, finance the costs of the road or street improvements, and become the sole beneficiary of the reimbursements that are contributed. A county, city, or town may be reimbursed only for the costs of improvements that benefit that portion of the public who will use the developments within the assessment reimbursement area established pursuant to RCW 35.72.040(1). No county, city, or town costs for improvements that benefit the general public may be reimbursed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of transportation may, for state highways, participate with the owners of real estate or may be the sole participant in the financing of improvement projects, in the same manner and subject to the same restrictions as provided for counties, cities, and towns, in subsection (1) of this section. The department shall enter into agreements whereby the appropriate county, city, or town shall act as an agent of the department in administering this chapter.</p>
