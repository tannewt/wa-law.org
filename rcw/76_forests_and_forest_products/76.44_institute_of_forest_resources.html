<p>The legislature finds that there are many issues facing the forest sector, such as climate change, forest health and fire, carbon accounting, habitat and diversity, timber and water supplies, economic competitiveness, and the economic health of forest dependent communities. Enhancing the capability to effectively address these forest issues is critical to the state of Washington. To meet this need, the University of Washington school of forest resources will continue to work with the various interests concerned with the state's forest resources, including the legislature, state and federal governments, environmental organizations, local communities, the timber industry, and tribes, to improve these entities' ability to competitively recruit, educate, and train a high quality workforce. In order to meet these goals, it is important to our state, and in particular the University of Washington, to continue to have strong undergraduate and graduate programs in forestry and natural resources to provide well-trained professionals to meet workforce needs.</p>
