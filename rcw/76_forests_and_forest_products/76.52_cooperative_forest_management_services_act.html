<p>The department of natural resources may, by agreement, make available to forestland owners, equipment, materials, and personnel for the purpose of more intensively managing or protecting the land when the department determines that such services are not otherwise available at a cost which would encourage the landowner to so avail himself or herself, and that the use of department equipment, materials, or personnel will not jeopardize the management of state lands or other programs of the department. The department shall enter into a contractual agreement with the landowner for services rendered and shall recover the costs thereof.</p>

The agreement shall include provisions requiring the parties to pay all costs attributable to the conducting of the services on their respective lands.</p>
