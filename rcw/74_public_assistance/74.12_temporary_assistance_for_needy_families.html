<p>For the purposes of the administration of temporary assistance for needy families, the term &quot;dependent child&quot; means any child in need under the age of eighteen years who is living with a relative as specified under federal temporary assistance for needy families program requirements, in a place of residence maintained by one or more of such relatives as his or her or their homes. The term a &quot;dependent child&quot; shall, notwithstanding the foregoing, also include a child who would meet such requirements except for his or her removal from the home of a relative specified above as a result of a judicial determination that continuation therein would be contrary to the welfare of such child, for whose placement and care the state department of social and health services or the county office is responsible, and who has been placed in a licensed or approved child care institution or foster home as a result of such determination and who: (1) Was receiving an aid to families with dependent children grant for the month in which court proceedings leading to such determination were initiated; or (2) would have received aid to families with dependent children for such month if application had been made therefor; or (3) in the case of a child who had been living with a specified relative within six months prior to the month in which such proceedings were initiated, would have received aid to families with dependent children for such month if in such month he or she had been living with such a relative and application had been made therefor, as authorized by the social security act.</p>
<p>&quot;Temporary assistance for needy families&quot; means money payments, services, and remedial care with respect to a dependent child or dependent children and the needy parent or relative with whom the child lives.</p>
