<li>
<p>To require, as a condition of admission, assurance from the patient or any other person that the patient is not eligible for or will not apply for medicaid;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>To discharge a patient from a nursing home because of his or her status as a medicaid recipient; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To charge any amounts in excess of the medicaid rate from the date of eligibility, except for any supplementation permitted by the department pursuant to RCW 18.51.070.</p>

<li>
<p>Any nursing home which has a medicaid contract with the department shall maintain one list of names of persons seeking admission to the facility, which is ordered by the date of request for admission. This information shall be retained for one year from the month admission was requested. However, except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, a nursing facility is permitted to give preferential admission to individuals who seek admission from an assisted living facility, licensed under chapter 18.20 RCW, or from independent retirement housing, provided the nursing facility is owned by the same entity that owns the assisted living facility or independent housing which are located within the same proximate geographic area; and provided further, the purpose of such preferential admission is to allow continued provision of: (a) Culturally or faith-based services, or (b) services provided by a continuing care retirement community as defined in RCW 70.38.025.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may assess monetary penalties of a civil nature, not to exceed three thousand dollars for each violation of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because it is a matter of great public importance to protect senior citizens who need medicaid services from discriminatory treatment in obtaining long-term health care, any violation of this section shall be construed for purposes of the application of the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW, to constitute an unfair or deceptive act or practice or unfair method of competition in the conduct of trade or commerce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not an act of discrimination under this chapter to refuse to admit a patient if admitting that patient would prevent the needs of the other patients residing in that facility from being met at that facility, or if the facility's refusal is consistent with subsection (4) of this section.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall institute minimum staffing standards for nursing homes. Beginning July 1, 2016, facilities must provide a minimum of 3.4 hours per resident day of direct care. Direct care staff has the same meaning as defined in RCW 74.42.010. The minimum staffing standard includes the time when such staff are providing hands-on care related to activities of daily living and nursing-related tasks, as well as care planning. The legislature intends to increase the minimum staffing standard to 4.1 hours per resident day of direct care, but the effective date of a standard higher than 3.4 hours per resident day of direct care will be identified if and only if funding is provided explicitly for an increase of the minimum staffing standard for direct care.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The department shall establish in rule a system of compliance of minimum direct care staffing standards by January 1, 2016. Oversight must be done at least quarterly using the centers for medicare and medicaid services' payroll-based journal and nursing home facility census and payroll data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall establish in rule by January 1, 2016, a system of financial penalties for facilities out of compliance with minimum staffing standards. No monetary penalty may be issued during the implementation period of July 1, 2016, through September 30, 2016. If a facility is found noncompliant during the implementation period, the department shall provide a written notice identifying the staffing deficiency and require the facility to provide a sufficiently detailed correction plan to meet the statutory minimum staffing levels. Monetary penalties begin October 1, 2016. Monetary penalties must be established based on a formula that calculates the cost of wages and benefits for the missing staff hours. If a facility meets the requirements in subsection (3) or (4) of this section, the penalty amount must be based solely on the wages and benefits of certified nurse aides. The first monetary penalty for noncompliance must be at a lower amount than subsequent findings of noncompliance. Monetary penalties established by the department may not exceed two hundred percent of the wage and benefit costs that would have otherwise been expended to achieve the required staffing minimum hours per resident day for the quarter. A facility found out of compliance must be assessed a monetary penalty at the lowest penalty level if the facility has met or exceeded the requirements in subsection (2) of this section for three or more consecutive years. Beginning July 1, 2016, pursuant to rules established by the department, funds that are received from financial penalties must be used for technical assistance, specialized training, or an increase to the quality enhancement established in RCW 74.46.561.</p>

<p>The department shall establish in rule an exception allowing geriatric behavioral health workers as defined in RCW 74.42.010 to be recognized in the minimum staffing requirements as part of the direct care service delivery to individuals who have a behavioral health condition. Hours worked by geriatric behavioral health workers may be recognized as direct care hours for purposes of the minimum staffing requirements only up to a portion of the total hours equal to the proportion of resident days of clients with a behavioral health condition identified at that facility on the most recent semiannual minimum data set. In order to qualify for the exception:</p>
<ol type="i">

<li>
<p>Have a bachelor's or master's degree in social work, behavioral health, or other related areas; or</p>

<li>
<p>The department shall establish a limited exception to the 3.4 hours per resident day staffing requirement for facilities demonstrating a good faith effort to hire and retain staff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To determine initial facility eligibility for exception consideration, the department shall send surveys to facilities anticipated to be below, at, or slightly above the 3.4 hours per resident day requirement. These surveys must measure the hours per resident day in a manner as similar as possible to the centers for medicare and medicaid services' payroll-based journal and cover the staffing of a facility from October through December of 2015, January through March of 2016, and April through June of 2016. A facility must be below the 3.4 staffing standard on all three surveys to be eligible for exception consideration. If the staffing hours per resident day for a facility declines from any quarter to another during the survey period, the facility must provide sufficient information to the department to allow the department to determine if the staffing decrease was deliberate or a result of neglect, which is the lack of evidence demonstrating the facility's efforts to maintain or improve its staffing ratio. The burden of proof is on the facility and the determination of whether or not the decrease was deliberate or due to neglect is entirely at the discretion of the department. If the department determines a facility's decline was deliberate or due to neglect, that facility is not eligible for an exception consideration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To determine eligibility for exception approval, the department shall review the plan of correction submitted by the facility. Before a facility's exception may be renewed, the department must determine that sufficient progress is being made towards reaching the 3.4 hours per resident day staffing requirement. When reviewing whether to grant or renew an exception, the department must consider factors including but not limited to: Financial incentives offered by the facilities such as recruitment bonuses and other incentives; the robustness of the recruitment process; county employment data; specific steps the facility has undertaken to improve retention; improvements in the staffing ratio compared to the baseline established in the surveys and whether this trend is continuing; and compliance with the process of submitting staffing data, adherence to the plan of correction, and any progress toward meeting this plan, as determined by the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only facilities that have their direct care component rate increase capped according to RCW 74.46.561 are eligible for exception consideration. Facilities that will have their direct care component rate increase capped for one or two years are eligible for exception consideration through June 30, 2017. Facilities that will have their direct care component rate increase capped for three years are eligible for exception consideration through June 30, 2018.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may not grant or renew a facility's exception if the facility meets the 3.4 hours per resident day staffing requirement and subsequently drops below the 3.4 hours per resident day staffing requirement.</p>

<p>The department shall establish a limited exception process for large nonessential community providers that can demonstrate a good faith effort to hire a registered nurse for the last eight hours of required coverage per day. In granting an exception, the department may consider the competitiveness of the wages and benefits offered as compared to nursing facilities in comparable geographic or metropolitan areas within Washington state, the provider's recruitment and retention efforts, and the availability of registered nurses in the particular geographic area. A one-year exception may be granted and may be renewable; however, the department may limit the admission of new residents, based on medical conditions or complexities, when a registered nurse is not on-site and readily available. If a large nonessential community provider receives an exception, that information must be included in the department's nursing home locator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By August 1, 2023, and every three years thereafter, the department, along with a stakeholder work group established by the department, shall conduct a review of the exceptions process to determine if it is still necessary. As part of this review, the department shall provide the legislature with a report that includes enforcement and citation data for large nonessential community providers that were granted an exception in the three previous fiscal years in comparison to those without an exception. The report must include a similar comparison of data, provided to the department by the long-term care ombuds, on long-term care ombuds referrals for large nonessential community providers that were granted an exception in the three previous fiscal years and those without an exception. This report, along with a recommendation as to whether the exceptions process should continue, is due to the legislature by December 1st of each year in which a review is conducted.

<p>Nursing facilities may provide telephone or web-based transitional care management services to persons discharged from the facility to home for up to thirty days postdischarge.</p>

<li>
<p>When a nursing facility provides transitional care management services, the facility must coordinate postdischarge care and service needs with in-home agencies licensed under chapter 70.127 RCW, and other authorized care providers, to promote evidence-based transition care planning. In-home service agencies and other authorized care providers, including the department, shall, when appropriate, determine resident eligibility for postdischarge care and services and coordinate with nursing facilities to plan a safe transition of the client to the home setting. When a resident is discharged to home and is without in-home care or services due to the resident's refusal of care or their ineligibility for care, the nursing facility may provide telephone or web-based transitional care management services. These services may include care coordination services, review of the discharge plan, instructions to promote compliance with the discharge plan, reminders or assistance with scheduling follow-up appointments with other health care professionals consistent with the discharge plan, and promotion of self-management of the client's health condition. Web-based transition care services may include patient education and the provision of services described in this section. They are not intended to include telehealth monitoring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the nursing facility identifies concerns in client care that result from telephone or web-based transitional care management services, the nursing facility will notify the client's primary care physician.

<li>
<p>To ensure the proper delivery of services and the maintenance and improvement in quality of care through self-review, each facility may maintain a quality assurance committee that, at a minimum, includes:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The director of nursing services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A physician designated by the facility; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Three other members from the staff of the facility.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>When established, the quality assurance committee shall meet at least quarterly to identify issues that may adversely affect quality of care and services to residents and to develop and implement plans of action to correct identified quality concerns or deficiencies in the quality of care provided to residents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To promote quality of care through self-review without the fear of reprisal, and to enhance the objectivity of the review process, the department shall not require, and the long-term care ombuds program shall not request, disclosure of any quality assurance committee records or reports, unless the disclosure is related to the committee's compliance with this section, if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The records or reports are not maintained pursuant to statutory or regulatory mandate; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The records or reports are created for and collected and maintained by the committee.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may request only information related to the quality assurance committee that may be necessary to determine whether a facility has a quality assurance committee and that it is operating in compliance with this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good faith attempts by the committee to identify and correct quality deficiencies shall not be used as a basis for imposing sanctions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the facility offers the department documents generated by, or for, the quality assurance committee as evidence of compliance with nursing facility requirements, the documents are protected as quality assurance committee documents under subsections (7) and (9) of this section when in the possession of the department. The department is not liable for an inadvertent disclosure, a disclosure related to a required federal or state audit, or disclosure of documents incorrectly marked as quality assurance committee documents by the facility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information and documents, including the analysis of complaints and incident reports, created specifically for, and collected and maintained by, a quality assurance committee are not subject to discovery or introduction into evidence in any civil action, and no person who was in attendance at a meeting of such committee or who participated in the creation, collection, or maintenance of information or documents specifically for the committee shall be permitted or required to testify in any civil action as to the content of such proceedings or the documents and information prepared specifically for the committee. This subsection does not preclude: (a) In any civil action, the discovery of the identity of persons involved in the care that is the basis of the civil action whose involvement was independent of any quality improvement committee activity; and (b) in any civil action, the testimony of any person concerning the facts which form the basis for the institution of such proceedings of which the person had personal knowledge acquired independently of their participation in the quality assurance committee activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A quality assurance committee under subsection (1) of this section, RCW 18.20.390, 70.41.200, 4.24.250, or 43.70.510 may share information and documents, including the analysis of complaints and incident reports, created specifically for, and collected and maintained by, the committee, with one or more other quality assurance committees created under subsection (1) of this section, RCW 18.20.390, 70.41.200, 4.24.250, or 43.70.510 for the improvement of the quality of care and services rendered to nursing facility residents. Information and documents disclosed by one quality assurance committee to another quality assurance committee and any information and documents created or maintained as a result of the sharing of information and documents shall not be subject to the discovery process and confidentiality shall be respected as required by subsections (7) and (9) of this section, RCW 18.20.390 (6) and (8), 43.70.510(4), 70.41.200(3), and 4.24.250(1). The privacy protections of chapter 70.02 RCW and the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and its implementing regulations apply to the sharing of individually identifiable patient information held by a coordinated quality improvement program. Any rules necessary to implement this section shall meet the requirements of applicable federal and state privacy laws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information and documents, including the analysis of complaints and incident reports, created specifically for, and collected and maintained by, a quality assurance committee are exempt from disclosure under chapter 42.56 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding any records created for the quality assurance committee, the facility shall fully set forth in the resident's records, available to the resident, the department, and others as permitted by law, the facts concerning any incident of injury or loss to the resident, the steps taken by the facility to address the resident's needs, and the resident outcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A facility operated as part of a hospital licensed under chapter 70.41 RCW may maintain a quality assurance committee in accordance with this section which shall be subject to the provisions of subsections (1) through (10) of this section or may conduct quality improvement activities for the facility through a quality improvement committee under RCW 70.41.200 which shall be subject to the provisions of RCW 70.41.200(9).</p>
