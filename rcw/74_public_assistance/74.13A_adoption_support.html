<p>It is the policy of this state to enable the secretary to charge fees for certain services to adoptive parents who are able to pay for such services.</p>
<p>It is, however, also the policy of this state that the secretary of the department shall be liberal in waiving, reducing, or deferring payment of any such fee to the end that adoptions shall be encouraged in cases where prospective adoptive parents lack means.</p>
<p>It is the policy of this state to encourage, within the limits of available funds, the adoption of certain hard to place children in order to make it possible for children living in, or likely to be placed in, foster homes or institutions to benefit from the stability and security of permanent homes in which such children can receive continuous parental care, guidance, protection, and love and to reduce the number of such children who must be placed or remain in foster homes or institutions until they become adults.</p>
<p>It is also the policy of this state to try, by means of the program of adoption support authorized in RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080, to reduce the total cost to the state of foster home and institutional care.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that the current state adoption support policy to encourage, within available funds, the adoption of certain hard to place children , has expedited permanency for children who are unable to reunify with their family and has resulted in savings otherwise spent on foster care.</p>
<p>The legislature also finds that current economic conditions have reduced state funds available for many critical programs. The legislature further finds that adoption support expenditures continue to increase. Given these realities, the legislature finds there is a need to control adoption support costs without adversely impacting permanency for state dependent children.</p>
<p>The legislature acknowledges that the best way to reduce adoption support and foster care expenditures is to safely prevent children from entering the foster care system. However, the legislature also finds that the recent prospective reduction to adoption support payments set forth in chapter 50, Laws of 2011 1st sp. sess. has not, to date, adversely impacted permanency for foster children in need of adoptive homes.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to continue the adoption assistance rate reduction beyond the period set forth in the operating budget, while focusing on sustainable long-term efforts to prevent children from entering the foster care system, such as pursuing a potential federal Title IV-E waiver , which if granted, would allow Washington to reinvest dollars otherwise spent on foster care in prevention programs.</p>
<p>The legislature also finds that many adoptive parents spend adoption support payments on additional mental health services for adoptive children that are not currently covered by existing public programs. The legislature intends to offset adoption support payment expenditures by facilitating efforts to improve the access and quality of existing mental health services for adoptive families in the long term.</p>

<p>When a child proposed for adoption is placed with a prospective adoptive parent the department may charge such parent a fee in payment or part payment of such adoptive parent's part of the cost of the adoption services rendered and to be rendered by the department.</p>
<p>In charging such fees the department shall treat a husband and wife as a single prospective adoptive parent.</p>
<p>Each such fee shall be fixed according to a sliding scale based on the ability to pay of the prospective adoptive parent or parents.</p>
<p>Such fee scale shall be annually fixed by the secretary after considering the recommendations of the committee designated by the secretary to advise him or her on child welfare and pursuant to the regulations to be issued by the secretary in accordance with the provisions of Title 34 RCW.</p>
<p>The secretary may waive, defer, or provide for payment in installments without interest of, any such fee whenever in his or her judgment payment or immediate payment would cause economic hardship to such adoptive parent or parents.</p>
<p>Nothing in this section shall require the payment of a fee to the state of Washington in a case in which an adoption results from independent placement or placement by a licensed child-placing or supervising agency.</p>

<p>The secretary shall issue rules and regulations to assist in the administration of the program of adoption support authorized by RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disbursements from the appropriations available from the general fund shall be made pursuant to such rules and regulations and pursuant to agreements conforming thereto to be made by the secretary with parents for the purpose of supporting the adoption of children in, or likely to be placed in, foster homes or child caring institutions who are found by the secretary to be difficult to place in adoption because of physical or other reasons; including, but not limited to, disabilities, emotional disturbance, ethnic background, language, race, color, age, or sibling grouping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such agreements shall meet the following criteria:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The child whose adoption is to be supported pursuant to such agreement shall be or have been a child hard to place in adoption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such agreement must relate to a child who was or is residing in a foster home or child-caring institution or a child who, in the judgment of the secretary, is both eligible for, and likely to be placed in, either a foster home or a child-caring institution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such agreement shall provide that adoption support shall not continue beyond the time that the adopted child reaches eighteen years of age, becomes emancipated, dies, or otherwise ceases to need support. If the secretary finds that continuing dependency of such child after such child reaches eighteen years of age warrants the continuation of support pursuant to RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080 the secretary may do so, subject to all the provisions of RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080, including annual review of the amount of such support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any prospective parent who is to be a party to such agreement shall be a person who has the character, judgment, sense of responsibility, and disposition which make him or her suitable as an adoptive parent of such child.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>At least six months before an adoption is finalized under chapter 26.33 RCW and RCW 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080, the department must provide to the prospective adoptive parent, in writing, information describing the limits of the adoption support program including the following information:</p>

<p>The factors to be considered by the secretary in setting the amount of any payment or payments to be made pursuant to RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080 and in adjusting standards hereunder shall include: The size of the family including the adoptive child, the usual living expenses of the family, the special needs of any family member including education needs, the family income, the family resources and plan for savings, the medical and hospitalization needs of the family, the family's means of purchasing or otherwise receiving such care, and any other expenses likely to be needed by the child to be adopted. In setting the amount of any initial payment made pursuant to RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080, the secretary is authorized to establish maximum payment amounts that are reasonable and allow permanency planning goals related to adoption of children under RCW 13.34.145 to be achieved at the earliest possible date. To encourage adoption of children between the ages of fourteen and eighteen, and in particular those children between the ages of fourteen and eighteen who are hard to place for adoption, the secretary is authorized to include as part of any new negotiated adoption agreement executed after October 19, 2017, continued eligibility for the Washington college bound scholarship pursuant to RCW 28B.118.010.</p>
<p>The amounts paid for the support of a child pursuant to RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080 may vary from family to family and from year to year. Due to changes in economic circumstances or the needs of the child such payments may be discontinued and later resumed.</p>
<p>Payments under RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080 may be continued by the secretary subject to review as provided for herein, if such parent or parents having such child in their custody establish their residence in another state or a foreign jurisdiction.</p>
<p>In fixing the standards to govern the amount and character of payments to be made for the support of adopted children pursuant to RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080 and before issuing rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13A.005 through 74.13A.080, the secretary shall consider the comments and recommendations of the committee designated by the secretary to advise him or her with respect to child welfare.</p>
