<p>The legislature reaffirms its declarations under RCW 13.34.020 that the family unit is the fundamental resource of American life which should be nurtured and that the family unit should remain intact in the absence of compelling evidence to the contrary. The legislature declares that the goal of serving emotionally disturbed and mentally ill children, potentially dependent children, and families-in-conflict in their own homes to avoid out-of-home placement of the child, when that form of care is premature, unnecessary, or inappropriate, is a high priority of this state.</p>
