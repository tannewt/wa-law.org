<p>The history, economy, culture, and the future of Washington state's agriculture involves the dairy industry. In order to develop and promote Washington's dairy products as part of an existing comprehensive scheme to regulate those products the legislature declares:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>That the Washington state dairy products commission is created. The commission may also take actions under the name &quot;the dairy farmers of Washington&quot;;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That it is vital to the continued economic well-being of the citizens of this state and their general welfare that its dairy products be properly promoted by (a) enabling the dairy industry to help themselves in establishing orderly, fair, sound, efficient, and unhampered marketing, grading, and standardizing of the dairy products they produce; and (b) working to stabilize the dairy industry by increasing consumption of dairy products within the state, the nation, and internationally;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That dairy producers operate within a regulatory environment that imposes burdens on them for the benefit of society and the citizens of the state and includes restrictions on marketing autonomy. Those restrictions may impair the dairy producer's ability to compete in local, domestic, and foreign markets;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That it is in the overriding public interest that support for the dairy industry be clearly expressed, that adequate protection be given to agricultural commodities, uses, activities, and operations, and that dairy products be promoted individually, and as part of a comprehensive industry to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Enhance the reputation and image of Washington state's agriculture industry;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase the sale and use of Washington state's dairy products in local, domestic, and foreign markets;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protect the public by educating the public in reference to the quality, care, and methods used in the production of Washington state's dairy products;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase the knowledge of the health-giving qualities and dietetic value of dairy products; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support and engage in programs or activities that benefit the production, handling, processing, marketing, and uses of dairy products produced in Washington state;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>That this chapter is enacted in the exercise of the police powers of this state for the purpose of protecting the health, peace, safety, and general welfare of the people of this state; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the dairy industry is a highly regulated industry and that this chapter and the rules adopted under it are only one aspect of the regulated industry. Other regulations and restraints applicable to the dairy industry include the:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Federal marketing order under 7 C.F.R., Part 1124;</p>

<li>
<p>The commission may adopt rules to eliminate, combine, revise, amend, or otherwise modify commission districts and areas in accordance with the intent and provisions of this chapter. In the event of redistricting, the procedure for transition of appointments to new districts or areas must be set forth in rule. The commission may adopt rules allowing the appointment of additional dealers to the commission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The boundaries and numbers of the commission districts or areas shall be maintained in a manner that ensures each producer a representation in the commission which is reasonably equal with the representation afforded all other producers by their commission members and maintains reasonable apportionment for each historical production or marketing area. However, the requirement of this section for reasonable equal representation of each producer on the commission does not require an equality of representation when the commission districts east of the crest of the Cascade mountains are compared to the commission districts west of the crest of the Cascade mountains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall, when requested in accordance with the provisions of the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW as enacted or hereafter amended, or on its own initiative, hold hearings to determine if new boundaries for each commission district or area should be established in order to afford each producer a reasonably equal representation in the commission, and if the commission so finds it shall change the boundaries of the commission districts or areas to carry out the proper reapportionment of producer representation on the commission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A review of boundaries and areas must be conducted by the commission at least every five years and take into consideration the distribution of producers, the number of head, production levels, and other relevant factors as determined by the commission. If the commission fails to carry out its responsibilities as set forth in this section, the director may upon request by ten producers institute a hearing to determine if there is reasonably equal representation for each producer on the commission. If the director finds that such reasonably equal representation is lacking, he or she then shall realign the district boundaries in a manner which will provide proper representation on the commission for each producer.</p>
