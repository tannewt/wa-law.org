<li>
<p>The commercial feed license expires on June 30th of each year. The application and fee for a commercial feed license renewal is due July 1st of each year. If a completed application and appropriate fee is not received by July 1st, a late renewal fee of fifty dollars per facility will be assessed in addition to the license fee and must be paid by the applicant before the renewal license is issued. A late renewal fee will not apply if the applicant furnishes an affidavit that he or she has not distributed a commercial feed subsequent to the expiration of his or her prior license.

If aggrieved by the decision, the applicant or licensee may request a hearing as authorized under chapter 34.05 RCW.</p>

<li>
<p>A distributor is not required to register a pet food or specialty pet food that is already registered under this chapter, as long as it is distributed with the original label.</p>

<li>
<p>Changes in the guarantee of either chemical or ingredient composition of a pet food or specialty pet food registered under this chapter may be permitted if there is satisfactory evidence that such changes would not result in a lowering of the feed value of the product for the purpose for which it was designed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may deny registration of any pet food or speciality pet food not in compliance with this chapter and its rules. The department may cancel any registration subsequently found to be not in compliance with this chapter and its rules. Prior to denial or cancellation of a registration, the applicant or registrant of an existing registered pet food or specialty pet food must be notified of the reasons and given an opportunity to amend the application to comply. If the applicant does not make the necessary corrections, the department will deny or cancel the registration. The applicant or registrant of an existing registered pet food or specialty pet food may request a hearing as provided for in chapter 34.05 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application for renewal of registration is due July 1st of each registration period. If an application for renewal is not received by the department by the due date, a late fee of twenty dollars per product is added to the original fee and must be paid by the applicant before the renewal registration may be issued. A late fee will not apply if the applicant furnishes an affidavit that he or she has not distributed this feed subsequent to the expiration of the prior registration. Payment of a late fee does not prevent the department from imposing a penalty authorized by this chapter for the violation.</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>For the purpose of enforcement of this chapter, and in order to determine whether its provisions have been complied with, including whether an operation is subject to such provisions, inspectors duly designated by the director, upon presenting appropriate credentials, and a written notice to the owner, operator, or agent in charge, are authorized (a) to enter, during normal business hours, any facility within the state in which commercial feeds are manufactured, transloaded, processed, packed, distributed, or held for distribution, or to enter a vehicle being used to transport or hold such feeds; and (b) to inspect at reasonable times and within reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner, the facilities, or vehicles and all pertinent equipment, finished and unfinished materials, containers, labeling, and records. The inspection may include the verification of only such records, and production and control procedures as may be necessary to determine compliance with this chapter and its rules.</p>

<li>
<p>A separate notice shall be given for each such inspection, but a notice is not required for each entry made during the period covered by the inspection. Each such inspection shall be commenced and completed with reasonable promptness. Upon completion of the inspection, the person in charge of the facility or vehicle shall be so notified.</p>

<li>
<p>If the owner of a facility or vehicle described in subsection (1) of this section, or his or her agent, refuses to admit the director or his or her agent to inspect in accordance with subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the director or his or her agent is authorized to obtain from any court of competent jurisdiction a warrant directing such owner or his or her agent to submit the premises described in the warrant to inspection.</p>

<li>
<p>For the enforcement of this chapter, the director or his or her duly assigned agent is authorized to enter upon any public or private premises including any vehicle of transport during regular business hours to have access to, and to obtain samples, and to examine records relating to distribution of commercial feeds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sampling and analysis shall be conducted in accordance with methods published by the association of official analytical chemists, or in accordance with other generally recognized methods.</p>

<li>
<p>The results of all analyses of official samples shall be forwarded by the department to the person named on the label and to the purchaser, if known. If the inspection and analysis of an official sample indicates a commercial feed has been adulterated or misbranded and upon request within thirty days following the receipt of the analysis, the department shall furnish to the registrant or licensee a portion of the sample concerned.
