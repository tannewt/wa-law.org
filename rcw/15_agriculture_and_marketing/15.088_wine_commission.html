<p>The legislature declares that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Marketing is a dynamic and changing part of Washington agriculture and a vital element in expanding the state economy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sale in the state and export to other states and abroad of wine made in the state contribute substantial benefits to the economy of the state, provide a large number of jobs and sizeable tax revenues, and have an important stabilizing effect on prices received by agricultural producers. Development of exports of these commodities abroad will contribute favorably to the balance of trade of the United States and of the state. The sale and export are therefore affected with the public interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The production of wine grapes in the state is a new and important segment of Washington agriculture which has potential for greater contribution to the economy of the state if it undergoes healthy development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The general welfare of the people of the state will be served by healthy development of the activities of growing and processing wine grapes, which development will improve the tax bases of local communities in which agricultural land and processing facilities are located, and obviate the need for state and federal funding of local services. The industries are therefore affected with the public interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creation of a commission for the public purpose of administering the revenue of the commission under RCW 66.24.210(3) for the enhancement of production of wine grapes and wine and the marketing of Washington wine will materially advance the industries of growing and processing wine grapes and thereby the interests of the citizens of the state.</p>

<p>The history, economy, culture, and future of Washington state's agriculture involves the wine industry. In order to develop and promote wine grapes and wine as part of an existing comprehensive scheme to regulate those products the legislature declares:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>That it is vital to the continued economic well-being of the citizens of this state and their general welfare that its wine grapes and wine be properly promoted by (a) enabling the wine industry to help themselves in establishing orderly, fair, sound, efficient, and unhampered marketing of wine grapes and wines they produce; and (b) working to stabilize the wine industry by increasing markets for wine grapes and wine within the state, the nation, and internationally;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That wine grape growers and wine producers operate within a regulatory environment that imposes burdens on them for the benefit of society and the citizens of the state and includes restrictions on marketing autonomy. Those restrictions may impair the wine grape growers' and wine producers' ability to compete in local, domestic, and foreign markets;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That it is in the overriding public interest that support for the wine industry be clearly expressed; that adequate protection be given to agricultural commodities, uses, activities, and operations; and that wine grapes and wine be promoted individually, and as part of a comprehensive industry to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Enhance the reputation and image of Washington state's agriculture industry;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase the sale and use of wine grapes and wine in local, domestic, and foreign markets;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protect the public by educating the public in reference to the quality, care, and methods used in the production of wine grapes and wine;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase the knowledge of the qualities and value of Washington's wine grapes and wine; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support and engage in programs or activities that benefit the production, handling, processing, marketing, and uses of wine grapes and wine;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>That this chapter is enacted in the exercise of the police powers of this state for the purpose of protecting the health, peace, safety, and general welfare of the people of this state; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the production and marketing of wine grapes and wine is a highly regulated industry and that the provisions of this chapter and the rules adopted under it are only one aspect of the regulated industry. Other regulations and restraints applicable to the wine grape and wine industry include:</p>
