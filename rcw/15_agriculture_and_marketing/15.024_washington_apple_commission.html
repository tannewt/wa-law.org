The meetings may be held each year, as far as practicable, at the same time and place as an annual meeting of a grower or dealer organization that represents a majority of the state's apple growers or dealers, but not while the same is in actual session. Public notice of such meetings must be given by the commission in such manner as it may determine: PROVIDED, That nonreceipt of the notice by any interested person does not invalidate the proceedings. Any qualified person may be nominated orally for such positions at the respective meetings.

<li>
<p>Advisory ballots shall be mailed to all growers for grower positions and to affected dealers for dealer positions. The advisory ballot shall be conducted in a manner so that it is a secret ballot.

Nominees to be forwarded to the director for consideration for appointment to grower positions on the commission shall be selected by a majority of the votes cast by the apple growers in the respective districts. Each grower engaged in the business of producing apples for market in commercial quantities within the district is entitled to one vote. An individual commercial orchard operator, if otherwise qualified, is entitled to vote, even though he or she is also a member of a partnership or corporation, which also is entitled to vote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director has the discretion to appoint or reject any candidate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any candidate whose name is forwarded to the director for potential appointment shall submit to the director a letter stating why he or she wishes to be appointed to the commission.

<li>
<p>There is hereby levied annually upon all fresh apples grown in this state, and all apples packed as Washington apples, including fresh sliced, an assessment of eight and seventy-five one-hundredths cents per one hundred pounds of apples, based on net shipping weight, or reasonable equivalent net product assessment measurement as determined by the commission. All moneys collected under this subsection must be expended to effectuate the purpose and objects of this chapter. The assessment rates established in this subsection may be increased or decreased pursuant to the procedure in subsection (2) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the commission determines based on information available to it that the revenue from the assessment levied under this chapter is too high or is inadequate to accomplish the purposes of this chapter, then with the oversight of the director the commission shall commence rule making setting forth the needs of the industry, the extent and probable cost of commission activities identified as necessary to address the needs of the industry together with a brief statement justifying each activity, the proposed new assessment rate, and the expected revenue from the proposed assessment. A different rate may be proposed for any specific variety or for fresh apples sliced or cut for raw consumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon receiving the director's approval of the rule making commenced under subsection (2) of this section, and with the oversight of the director, the commission may conduct a referendum to determine whether growers assent to the proposed new assessment rate, or may refer the matter to the director to conduct the referendum on behalf of the commission. An increase in the assessment rate is approved if two-thirds of growers vote in favor and the growers voting in favor represent two-thirds of the apples grown in the two prior crop years, based on net shipping weight. A decrease in the assessment rate is approved if a majority of growers vote in favor and the growers voting in favor represent two-thirds of the apples grown in the two prior crop years, based on the net shipping weight. If approved, the new rate must be adopted in rule in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW.</p>

<li>
<p>A petition may be filed with the commission to reduce the assessment authorized in RCW 15.24.090 to zero. To be valid, the petition must be signed by at least eight percent of all apple growers eligible to vote in commission referendum elections. The petition shall contain the name of a person designated to represent the petitioners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon receipt of a valid petition, the commission shall prepare a document discussing the substance of the petition. A statement in favor of the petition shall be written by the proponents of the petition. A statement opposing the petition may be written by the commission or an opponent. The document and a notice of public hearing shall be sent to apple growers eligible to vote in commission referendum elections at least twenty days prior to the scheduled public hearings. The commission shall hold public hearings in Yakima and Wenatchee on the petition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following the public hearings, the question of whether to reduce the assessment authorized in RCW 15.24.090 to zero shall be referred to a referendum mail ballot. The commission shall certify to the director a list of apple growers eligible to vote in commission referendum elections. The referendum shall be conducted and supervised by the director using the certified list. Inadvertent failure to notify a grower does not invalidate a referendum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The referendum will be approved if a simple majority of apple growers voting in the referendum election vote in favor of the elimination of the assessment. The director will certify the results of the vote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The referendum vote shall be binding and may not be overturned by action of the commission or director. If the referendum is approved, the commission shall immediately commence activities to wind down its operations. However, the elimination of the assessment shall not be effective until six months from the date the referendum result is certified by the director. If the referendum fails, neither the commission nor the director will take further action on the petition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission is responsible for all its own costs and all the director's costs associated with the hearing, notice, and referendum process. A subsequent petition may not be filed any sooner than five years following the certification of the results of any previously held referendum conducted under this section.</p>

<li>
<p>This chapter is passed:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>In the exercise of the police power of the state to assure, through this chapter, and other chapters, that the apple industry is highly regulated to protect the public health, to prevent fraudulent practices, to promote the welfare of the state, and to stabilize and protect the apple industry of the state as a vital and integral part of its economy for the benefit of all its citizens;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because the apple crop grown in Washington comprises one of the major agricultural crops of Washington, and that therefore the business of selling and distributing such crop and the expanding and protection of its market is of public interest;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because it is necessary and expedient to enhance the reputation of Washington apples in domestic and foreign markets;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because it is necessary to discover the health giving qualities and food and dietetic value of Washington apples, and to spread that knowledge throughout the world in order to increase the consumption of Washington apples;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because Washington grown apples are handicapped by high freight rates in competition with eastern and foreign grown apples in the markets of the world, and this disadvantage can only be overcome by education and advertising;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because the stabilizing and promotion of the apple industry, the enlarging of its markets, and the increasing of the consumption of apples are necessary to assure and increase the payment of taxes to the state and its subdivisions, to alleviate unemployment within the state, and increase wages for agricultural labor;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To disseminate information giving the public full knowledge of the manner of production, the cost and expense thereof, the care taken to produce and sell only apples of the finest quality, the methods and care used in preparing for market, and the methods of sale and distribution to increase the amount secured by the grower therefor, so that they can pay higher wages and pay their taxes, and by such information to reduce the cost of distribution so that the spread between the cost to the consumer and the amount received by the grower will be reduced to the minimum absolutely necessary; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To protect the general public by educating it in reference to the various varieties and grades of Washington apples, the time to use and consume each variety, and the uses to which each variety should be put.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The history, economy, culture, and future of Washington state's agricultural industry involves the apple industry. In order to develop and promote apples and apple products as part of an existing comprehensive scheme to regulate those products, the legislature declares:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>That it is vital to the continued economic well-being of the citizens of this state and their general welfare that its apple and apple products be properly promoted by establishing orderly, fair, sound, efficient, and unhampered marketing, grading, and standards of and for apples and apple products; and by working to stabilize the apple industry and by increasing consumption of apples and apple products within the state, nation, and internationally;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That apple growers operate within a regulatory environment that imposes burdens on them for the benefit of society and the citizens of the state and includes restrictions on marketing autonomy. Those restrictions may impair the agricultural grower's ability to compete in local, domestic, and foreign markets;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That it is in the overriding public interest that support for the apple industry be clearly expressed, that adequate protection be given to agricultural commodities, uses, activities, and operations, and that apples and apple products be promoted individually, as well as part of a comprehensive promotion of the agricultural industry to:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Enhance the reputation and image of Washington state's agricultural industry;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase the sale and use of apples and apple products in local, domestic, and foreign markets;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protect the public and consumers by correcting any false or misleading information and by educating the public in reference to the quality, care, and methods used in the production of apples and apple products, and in reference to the various sizes, grades, and varieties of apples and the uses to which each should be put;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase the knowledge of the health-giving qualities and dietetic value of apple products; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support and engage in programs or activities that benefit the production, handling, processing, marketing, and uses of apples and apple products;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the apple industry is a highly regulated industry and that this chapter and the rules adopted under it are only one aspect of the regulation of the industry. Other regulations and restraints applicable to the apple industry include:</p>
