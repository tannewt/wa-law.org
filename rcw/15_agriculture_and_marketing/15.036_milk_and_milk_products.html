<p>A milk processing plant must obtain an annual milk processing plant license from the department, which shall expire on June 30th of each year. A milk processing plant may choose to process: (a) Grade A milk and milk products; or (b) other milk products that are not classified grade A.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only one license may be required to process milk; however, milk processing plants must obtain the necessary endorsements from the department in order to process products as defined for each type of milk or milk product processing. Application for a license shall be on a form prescribed by the director and accompanied by a two hundred fifty dollar annual license fee beginning July 1, 2015. The applicant shall include on the application the full name of the applicant for the license and the location of the milk processing plant he or she intends to operate and any other necessary information. Upon the approval of the application by the director and compliance with the provisions of this chapter, including the applicable rules adopted under this chapter by the department, the applicant shall be issued a license or a renewal of a license.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Licenses shall be issued to cover only those products, processes, and operations specified in the license application and approved for licensing. If a license holder wishes to engage in processing a type of milk product that is different than the type specified on the application supporting the licensee's existing license and processing that type of food product would require a major addition to or modification of the licensee's processing facilities, the licensee shall submit an amendment to the current license application. In such a case, the licensee may engage in processing the new type of milk product only after the amendment has been approved by the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A licensee under this section shall not be required to obtain a food processing plant license under chapter 69.07 RCW to process milk or milk products.</p>
</li>

<p>Any producer or milk processing plant whose milk has been degraded by the director, or whose license has been suspended may at any time make application for the regrading of his or her products or the reinstatement of his or her license.</p>
<p>In case the lowered grade or the license suspension was the result of violation of the bacteriological or cooling temperature standards, the director may take further samples of the applicant's output, at a rate of not more than two samples per week. The director shall regrade the milk or milk products upward or reinstate the license on compliance with grade requirements as determined in accordance with the provisions of RCW 15.36.201.</p>
<p>In case the lowered grade of the applicant's product or the license suspension was due to a violation of an item other than bacteriological standard or cooling temperature, the said application must be accompanied by a statement signed by the applicant to the effect that the violated item of the specifications had been conformed with. Within one week of the receipt of such an application and statement the director shall make a reinspection of the applicant's establishment and thereafter as many additional reinspections as he or she may deem necessary to assure himself or herself that the applicant is again complying with the higher grade requirements. The higher grade or license shall be reinstated upon confirmation that all violated items are corrected and any period for reduction in grade or license suspensions as ordered by the director has been completed.</p>
