</li>
<li>
<p>Effective no later than July 1, 2012, no person under the age of sixteen years may be admitted to receive services at a residential habilitation center. Effective no later than July 1, 2012, no person under the age of twenty-one years may be admitted to receive services at a residential center, unless there are no service options available in the community to appropriately meet the needs of the individual. Such admission is limited to the provision of short-term respite or crisis stabilization services.</p>

All interest accruing from, or as a result of the deposit of such moneys in a single fund shall be credited to the personal accounts of the residents. All expenditures under this section shall be subject to the duty of accounting provided for in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The appointment of a guardian for the estate of a resident shall terminate the secretary's authority as custodian of any funds of the resident which may be subject to the control of the guardianship, upon receipt by the secretary of a certified copy of letters of guardianship. Upon the guardian's request, the secretary shall immediately forward to the guardian any funds subject to the control of the guardianship or other property of the resident remaining in the secretary's possession, together with a full and final accounting of all receipts and expenditures made.</p>
