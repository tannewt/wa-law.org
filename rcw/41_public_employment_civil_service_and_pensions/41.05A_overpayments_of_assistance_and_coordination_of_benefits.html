<p>The purpose of this chapter is to provide the health care authority with the powers, duties, and authority with respect to the collection of overpayments and the coordination of benefits that are currently provided to the department of social and health services in chapter 43.20B RCW. Providing the health care authority with these powers is necessary for the authority to administer medical services programs established under chapter 74.09 RCW currently administered by the department of social and health services programs but transferred to the authority under chapter 15, Laws of 2011 1st sp. sess., and programs transferred to the authority under chapter 201, Laws of 2018. The authority is authorized to collaborate with other state agencies in carrying out its duties under this chapter and, to the extent appropriate, may enter into agreements with such other agencies. Nothing in this chapter may be construed as diminishing the powers, duties, and authority granted to the department of social and health services in chapter 43.20B RCW with respect to the programs that will remain under its jurisdiction following enactment of chapter 15, Laws of 2011 1st sp. sess. and chapter 201, Laws of 2018.</p>

<li>
<p>To secure reimbursement of any assistance paid as a result of injuries to or illness of a recipient caused by the negligence or wrong of another, the authority is subrogated to the recipient's rights against a tort feasor or the tort feasor's insurer, or both.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority has the right to file a lien upon any recovery by or on behalf of the recipient from such tort feasor or the tort feasor's insurer, or both, to the extent of the value of the assistance paid by the authority: PROVIDED, That such lien is not effective against recoveries subject to wrongful death when there are surviving dependents of the deceased. The lien becomes effective upon filing with the county auditor in the county where the assistance was authorized or where any action is brought against the tort feasor or insurer. The lien may also be filed in any other county or served upon the recipient in the same manner as a civil summons if, in the authority's discretion, such alternate filing or service is necessary to secure the authority's interest. The additional lien is effective upon filing or service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lien of the authority may be against any claim, right of action, settlement proceeds, money, or benefits arising from an insurance program to which the recipient might be entitled (a) against the tort feasor or insurer of the tort feasor, or both, and (b) under any contract of insurance purchased by the recipient or by any other person providing coverage for the illness or injuries for which the assistance is paid or provided by the authority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If recovery is made by the authority under this section and the subrogation is fully or partially satisfied through an action brought by or on behalf of the recipient, the amount paid to the authority must bear its proportionate share of attorneys' fees and costs.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The determination of the proportionate share to be borne by the authority must be based upon:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The fees and costs approved by the court in which the action was initiated; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The written agreement between the attorney and client which establishes fees and costs when fees and costs are not addressed by the court.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>When fees and costs have been approved by a court, after notice to the authority, the authority has the right to be heard on the matter of attorneys' fees and costs or its proportionate share.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When fees and costs have not been addressed by the court, the authority shall receive at the time of settlement a copy of the written agreement between the attorney and client which establishes fees and costs and may request and examine documentation of fees and costs associated with the case. The authority may bring an action in superior court to void a settlement if it believes the attorneys' calculation of its proportionate share of fees and costs is inconsistent with the written agreement between the attorney and client which establishes fees and costs or if the fees and costs associated with the case are exorbitant in relation to cases of a similar nature.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rights and remedies provided to the authority in this section to secure reimbursement for assistance, including the authority's lien and subrogation rights, may be delegated to a managed health care system by contract entered into pursuant to RCW 74.09.522. A managed health care system may enforce all rights and remedies delegated to it by the authority to secure and recover assistance provided under a managed health care system consistent with its agreement with the authority.</p>

<p>Any person who owes a debt to the state for an overpayment of assistance must be notified of that debt by either personal service or certified mail, return receipt requested. Personal service, return of the requested receipt, or refusal by the debtor of such notice is proof of notice to the debtor of the debt owed. Service of the notice must be in the manner prescribed for the service of a summons in a civil action. The notice must include a statement of the debt owed; a statement that the property of the debtor will be subject to collection action after the debtor terminates from assistance; a statement that the property will be subject to lien and foreclosure, distraint, seizure and sale, or order to withhold and deliver; and a statement that the net proceeds will be applied to the satisfaction of the overpayment debt. Action to collect the debt by lien and foreclosure, distraint, seizure and sale, or order to withhold and deliver, is lawful after ninety days from the debtor's termination from assistance or the receipt of the notice of debt, whichever is later. This does not preclude the authority from recovering overpayments by deduction from subsequent assistance payments, not exceeding deductions as authorized under federal law with regard to financial assistance programs: PROVIDED, That subject to federal legal requirement, deductions may not exceed five percent of the grant payment standard if the overpayment resulted from error on the part of the authority or error on the part of the recipient without willful or knowing intent of the recipient in obtaining or retaining the overpayment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A current or former recipient who is aggrieved by a claim that he or she owes a debt for an overpayment of assistance has the right to an adjudicative proceeding pursuant to RCW 74.09.741. If no application is filed, the debt is subject to collection action as authorized under this chapter. If a timely application is filed, the execution of collection action on the debt is stayed pending the final adjudicative order or termination of the debtor from assistance, whichever occurs later.</p>

<p>After service of a notice of debt for an overpayment as provided for in RCW 41.05A.110, stating the debt accrued, the director may issue to any person, firm, corporation, association, political subdivision, or department of the state an order to withhold and deliver property of any kind including, but not restricted to, earnings which are due, owing, or belonging to the debtor, when the director has reason to believe that there is in the possession of such person, firm, corporation, association, political subdivision, or department of the state property which is due, owing, or belonging to the debtor. The order to withhold and deliver must state the amount of the debt, and must state in summary the terms of this section, RCW 6.27.150 and 6.27.160, chapters 6.13 and 6.15 RCW, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1673, and other state or federal exemption laws applicable generally to debtors. The order to withhold and deliver must be served in the manner prescribed for the service of a summons in a civil action or by certified mail, return receipt requested. Any person, firm, corporation, association, political subdivision, or department of the state upon whom service has been made shall answer the order to withhold and deliver within twenty days, exclusive of the day of service, under oath and in writing, and shall make true answers to the matters inquired of therein. The director may require further and additional answers to be completed by the person, firm, corporation, association, political subdivision, or department of the state. If any such person, firm, corporation, association, political subdivision, or department of the state possesses any property which may be subject to the claim of the authority, such property must be withheld immediately upon receipt of the order to withhold and deliver and must, after the twenty-day period, upon demand, be delivered forthwith to the director. The director shall hold the property in trust for application on the indebtedness involved or for return, without interest, in accordance with final determination of liability or nonliability. In the alternative, there may be furnished to the director a good and sufficient bond, satisfactory to the director, conditioned upon final determination of liability. Where money is due and owing under any contract of employment, express or implied, or is held by any person, firm, corporation, association, political subdivision, or department of the state subject to withdrawal by the debtor, such money must be delivered by remittance payable to the order of the director. Delivery to the director, subject to the exemptions under RCW 6.27.150 and 6.27.160, chapters 6.13 and 6.15 RCW, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1673, and other state or federal law applicable generally to debtors, of the money or other property held or claimed satisfies the requirement of the order to withhold and deliver. Delivery to the director serves as full acquittance, and the state warrants and represents that it shall defend and hold harmless for such actions persons delivering money or property to the director pursuant to this chapter. The state also warrants and represents that it shall defend and hold harmless for such actions persons withholding money or property pursuant to this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director shall also, on or before the date of service of the order to withhold and deliver, mail or cause to be mailed by certified mail a copy of the order to withhold and deliver to the debtor at the debtor's last known post office address or, in the alternative, a copy of the order to withhold and deliver must be served on the debtor in the same manner as a summons in a civil action on or before the date of service of the order or within two days thereafter. The copy of the order must be mailed or served together with a concise explanation of the right to petition for a hearing on any issue related to the collection. This requirement is not jurisdictional, but, if the copy is not mailed or served as provided in this section, or if any irregularity appears with respect to the mailing or service, the superior court, on its discretion on motion of the debtor promptly made and supported by affidavit showing that the debtor has suffered substantial injury due to the failure to mail the copy, may set aside the order to withhold and deliver and award to the debtor an amount equal to the damages resulting from the director's failure to serve on or mail to the debtor the copy.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A recipient feeling aggrieved by the action of the authority in recovering his or her temporary total disability compensation as provided in RCW 41.05A.230 through 41.05A.270 has the right to an adjudicative proceeding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A recipient seeking an adjudicative proceeding shall file an application with the director within twenty-eight days after the statement of lien and notice to withhold and deliver was mailed to the recipient. If the recipient files an application more than twenty-eight days after, but within one year of, the date the statement of lien and notice to withhold and deliver was mailed, the recipient is entitled to a hearing if the recipient shows good cause for the recipient's failure to file a timely application. The filing of a late application does not affect prior collection action pending the final adjudicative order. Until good cause for failure to file a timely application is decided, the authority may continue to collect under the lien and notice to withhold and deliver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proceeding shall be governed by chapter 34.05 RCW, the administrative procedure act.</p>
