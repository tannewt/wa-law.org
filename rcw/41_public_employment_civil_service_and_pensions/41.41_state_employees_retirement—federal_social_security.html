<p>&quot;Political subdivision&quot; means any political subdivision, or instrumentality of one or more such subdivisions, or proprietary enterprise acquired, purchased, or originated by one or more such subdivisions after December, 1950, which employs members of the state employees' retirement system. The state, its agencies, instrumentalities, and institutions of higher learning shall be grouped and considered as a single political subdivision.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The rights and benefits accruing to employees from membership in the state employees' retirement system shall in no way be altered or impaired by this plan or by the additional and supplementary OASI coverage which such employees may receive hereunder. Nothing herein shall be construed to alter in any way the obligations of any political subdivision or its employees to the retirement system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There shall be no additional cost to or involvement of the state with respect to OASI coverage for state employee members of the state employees' retirement system until this plan has been approved by the legislature.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>If any political subdivision other than that comprising the state, its agencies, instrumentalities, and institutions of higher learning fails to remit as provided herein employer contributions or employee contributions, or any part of either, such delinquent contributions may be recovered with interest at the rate of six percent per annum by action in a court of competent jurisdiction against the political subdivision; or such delinquent contributions may at the request of the governor be deducted from any moneys payable to such subdivision by the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each political subdivision shall be charged with a share of the cost of administration of this plan by the state, to be computed as that proportion of the overall cost of administration which its total annual contributions bear to the total annual contributions paid by all subdivisions on behalf of employees covered by the plan.

</li>
<li>
<p>OASI coverage may be made applicable as provided herein to employees of any political subdivision regardless of the approval or disapproval of this plan by any other subdivision.</p>
