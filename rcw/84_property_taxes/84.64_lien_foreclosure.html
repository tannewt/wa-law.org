<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (7) of this section, after the expiration of three years from the date of delinquency, when any property remains on the tax rolls for which no certificate of delinquency has been issued, the county treasurer must proceed to issue certificates of delinquency on the property to the county for all years' taxes, interest, and costs. However, the county treasurer, with the consent of the county legislative authority, may elect to issue a certificate for fewer than all years' taxes, interest, and costs to a minimum of the taxes, interest, and costs for the earliest year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certificates of delinquency are prima facie evidence that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The property described was subject to taxation at the time the same was assessed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The property was assessed as required by law;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The taxes or assessments were not paid at any time before the issuance of the certificate;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such certificate has the same force and effect as a lis pendens required under chapter 4.28 RCW.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county treasurer may include in the certificate of delinquency any assessments which are due on the property and are the responsibility of the county treasurer to collect. However, if the department of revenue has previously notified the county treasurer in writing that the property has a lien on it for deferred property taxes, the county treasurer must include in the certificate of delinquency any amounts deferred under chapters 84.37 and 84.38 RCW that remain unpaid, including accrued interest and costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The treasurer must file the certificates when completed with the clerk of the court at no cost to the treasurer, and the treasurer must thereupon, with legal assistance from the county prosecuting attorney, proceed to foreclose in the name of the county, the tax liens embraced in such certificates. Notice and summons must be served or notice given in a manner reasonably calculated to inform the owner or owners, and any person having a recorded interest in or lien of record upon the property, of the foreclosure action to appear within thirty days after service of such notice and defend such action or pay the amount due. Either (a) personal service upon the owner or owners and any person having a recorded interest in or lien of record upon the property, or (b) publication once in a newspaper of general circulation, which is circulated in the area of the property and mailing of notice by certified mail to the owner or owners and any person having a recorded interest in or lien of record upon the property, or, if a mailing address is unavailable, personal service upon the occupant of the property, if any, is sufficient. If such notice is returned as unclaimed, the treasurer must send notice by regular first-class mail. The notice must include the legal description on the tax rolls, the year or years for which assessed, the amount of tax and interest due, and the name of owner, or reputed owner, if known, and the notice must include the local street address, if any, for informational purposes only. The certificates of delinquency issued to the county may be issued in one general certificate in book form including all property, and the proceedings to foreclose the liens against the property may be brought in one action and all persons interested in any of the property involved in the proceedings may be made codefendants in the action, and if unknown may be therein named as unknown owners, and the publication of such notice is sufficient service thereof on all persons interested in the property described therein, except as provided above. The person or persons whose name or names appear on the treasurer's rolls as the owner or owners of the property must be considered and treated as the owner or owners of the property for the purpose of this section, and if upon the treasurer's rolls it appears that the owner or owners of the property are unknown, then the property must be proceeded against, as belonging to an unknown owner or owners, as the case may be, and all persons owning or claiming to own, or having or claiming to have an interest therein, are hereby required to take notice of the proceedings and of any and all steps thereunder. However, prior to the sale of the property, the treasurer must order or conduct a title search of the property to be sold to determine the legal description of the property to be sold and the record title holder, and if the record title holder or holders differ from the person or persons whose name or names appear on the treasurer's rolls as the owner or owners, the record title holder or holders must be considered and treated as the owner or owners of the property for the purpose of this section, and are entitled to the notice provided for in this section. Such title search must be included in the costs of foreclosure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the title search required by subsection (4) of this section reveals a lien in favor of the state for deferred taxes on the property under RCW 84.37.070 or 84.38.100 and such deferred taxes are not already included in the certificate of delinquency, the county treasurer must issue an amended certificate of delinquency on the property to include the outstanding amount of deferred taxes, including accrued interest. The amended certificate of delinquency must be filed with the clerk of the court as provided in subsection (4) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county treasurer may not sell property that is eligible for deferral of taxes under chapter 84.38 RCW but must require the owner of the property to file a declaration to defer taxes under chapter 84.38 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except those parcels where the local governing entity has declared and/or certified the parcel a nuisance affecting public peace, safety, and welfare, or other similar code provision, in no case may a certificate of delinquency be filed on property where the tax delinquency under chapter 84.56 RCW is one hundred dollars or less in total excluding interest and penalties.</p>

<p>The court must examine each application for judgment foreclosing a tax lien, and if a defense (specifying in writing the particular cause of objection) is offered by any person interested in any of the lands or lots to the entry of judgment, the court must hear and determine the matter in a summary manner, without other pleadings, and pronounce judgment. However, the court may, in its discretion, continue a case in which a defense is offered, to secure substantial justice to the contestants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In all judicial proceedings for the collection of taxes, and interest and costs thereon, all amendments which by law can be made in any personal action in the court must be allowed. No assessments of property or charge for any of the taxes is illegal on account of any irregularity in the tax list or assessment rolls, or on account of the assessment rolls or tax list not having been made, completed, or returned within the time required by law, or on account of the property having been charged or listed in the assessment or tax lists without name, or in any other name than that of the owner, and no error or informality in the proceedings of any of the officers connected with the assessment, levying or collection of the taxes, vitiates or in any manner affects the tax or the assessment of the tax. Any irregularities or informality in the assessment rolls or tax lists or in any of the proceedings connected with the assessment or levy of the taxes, or any omission or defective act of any officer connected with the assessment or levying of the taxes, may be, in the discretion of the court, corrected, supplied, and made to conform to the law by the court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court must give judgment for the taxes, interest, and costs that appear to be due upon the several lots or tracts described in the notice of application for judgment. The judgment must be a several judgment against each tract or lot or part of a tract or lot for each kind of tax included therein, including all interest and costs.

The order must be signed by the judge of the superior court and delivered to the county treasurer. The order is full and sufficient authority for the treasurer to proceed to sell the property for the sum set forth in the order and to take further steps provided by law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county treasurer must immediately after receiving the order and judgment proceed to sell the property as provided in this chapter to the highest and best bidder. The acceptable minimum bid must be the total amount of taxes, interest, and costs.

</li>
<li>
<p>All sales must be made at a location in the county on a date and time (except Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holidays) as the county treasurer may direct, and continue from day to day (Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays excepted) during the same hours until all lots or tracts are sold. The county treasurer must first give notice of the time and place where the sale is to take place for ten days successively by posting notice thereof in three public places in the county, one of which must be in the office of the treasurer.</p>

<li>
<p>As an alternative to the sale procedure specified in subsections (5) and (6) of this section, the county treasurer may conduct a public auction sale by electronic media pursuant to RCW 84.64.225.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No county officer or employee may directly or indirectly be a purchaser of the property at the sale.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>If the highest amount bid for any separate unit tract or lot exceeds the minimum bid due upon the whole property included in the certificate of delinquency, the excess must be refunded, following payment of all recorded water-sewer district liens, on application therefor, to the record owner of the property. The record owner of the property is the person who held title on the date of issuance of the certificate of delinquency. Assignments of interests, deeds, or other documents executed or recorded after filing the certificate of delinquency do not affect the payment of excess funds to the record owner. In the event that no claim for the excess is received by the county treasurer within three years after the date of the sale, the treasurer must at expiration of the three year period deposit the excess in the current expense fund of the county, which extinguishes all claims by any owner to the excess funds.</p>

<p>The county treasurer must execute to the purchaser of any piece or parcel of land a tax deed. The tax deed so made by the county treasurer, under the official seal of the treasurer's office, must be recorded in the same manner as other conveyances of real property, and vests in the grantee, his or her heirs and assigns the title to the property therein described, without further acknowledgment or evidence of the conveyance.</p>

<p>Appellate review of the judgment of the superior court may be sought as in other civil cases. However, review must be sought within thirty days after the entry of the judgment and the party taking such appeal shall deposit a sum equal to all taxes, interest, and costs with the clerk of the court, conditioned that the appellant shall prosecute the appeal with effect, and will pay the amount of any taxes, interest and costs which may be finally adjudged against the real property involved in the appeal by any court having jurisdiction of the cause. No appeal shall be allowed from any judgment for the sale of land or lot for taxes unless the party taking such appeal shall before the time of giving notice of such appeal, and within thirty days herein allowed within which to appeal, deposit with the clerk of the court of the county in which the land or lots are situated, an amount of money equal to the amount of the judgment and costs rendered in such cause by the trial court. If, in case of an appeal, the judgment of the lower court shall be affirmed, in whole or in part, the supreme court or the court of appeals shall enter judgment for the amount of taxes, interest and costs, with damages not to exceed twenty percent, and shall order that the amount deposited with the clerk of the court, or so much thereof as may be necessary, be credited upon the judgment so rendered, and execution shall issue for the balance of the judgment, damages and costs. The clerk of the supreme court or the clerk of the division of the court of appeals in which the appeal is pending shall transmit to the county treasurer of the county in which the land or lots are situated a certified copy of the order of affirmance, and it shall be the duty of such county treasurer upon receiving the same to apply so much of the amount deposited with the clerk of the court, as shall be necessary to satisfy the amount of the judgment of the supreme court, and to account for the same as collected taxes. If the judgment of the superior court shall be reversed and the cause remanded for a rehearing, and if, upon a rehearing, judgment shall be rendered for the sale of the land or lots for taxes, or any part thereof, and such judgment be not appealed from, as herein provided, the clerk of such superior court shall certify to the county treasurer the amount of such judgment, and thereupon it shall be the duty of the county treasurer to certify to the county clerk the amount deposited with the clerk of the court, and the county clerk shall credit such judgment with the amount of such deposit, or so much thereof as will satisfy the judgment, and the county treasurer shall be chargeable and accountable for the amount so credited as collected taxes. Nothing herein shall be construed as requiring an additional deposit in case of more than one appeal being prosecuted in the proceeding. If, upon a final hearing, judgment shall be refused for the sale of the land or lots for the taxes, interest, and costs, or any part thereof, in the proceedings, the county treasurer shall pay over to the party who shall have made such deposit, or his or her legally authorized agent or representative, the amount of the deposit, or so much thereof as shall remain after the satisfaction of the judgment against the land or lots in respect to which such deposit shall have been made.</p>
