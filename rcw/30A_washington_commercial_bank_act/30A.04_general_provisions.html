<p>The legislature declares that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Banking institutions and trust companies provide essential and valuable fiduciary management services to consumers, businesses, and nonprofit organizations in the state of Washington;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a critical public need to encourage and promote the revitalization and growth of the state's financial sector and realize its potential as an alternative global financial services hub;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fulfillment of this potential can best be achieved by taking measures to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Clarify prudential standards of professional fiduciary management to provide assurances to state, national, and international owners and managers of wealth;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote flexibility in the management of asset portfolios to respond to ever changing global conditions; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide certainty and clear expectations for owners of wealth, asset managers, and their respective advisors;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Banking institutions and nondepositary trust companies in the state of Washington will be better prepared to continue providing professional fiduciary management services effectively if laws of the state's banking institutions and nondepositary trust companies are modernized, clarified, reorganized and, with respect to some situations, amended;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a need for improved services and reduced costs for trust institution clients and customers and other consumers in this state through modernization of state law to clarify and thereby promote the delegation by trust institutions of fiduciary functions to qualified third-party professionals, to authorize clients to designate any trust institution to act for them, and to protect the public from excessive fees or undisclosed conflicts of interest of trust institutions and their affiliates;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Properly capitalized and professionally managed trusts and trust companies serving only family members and their affiliated entities, which operate privately and do not hold themselves out to, nor provide services to, the general public, should continue to operate without the necessity of being chartered or regulated by the department of financial institutions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority of the department of financial institutions needs to be clarified, preserved, and assured as the primary instrument of assuring the safety and soundness of banking institutions and nondepositary trust companies acting as fiduciaries and engaging in trust business in this state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nondepository trust companies should continue to act as fiduciaries and otherwise engage in trust business in this state, so long as they are properly capitalized, competently managed by persons of integrity, and supervised by the department of financial institutions so as to ensure that such trust companies are operated in compliance with law, in a safe and sound manner, and in a manner which protects trust settlors, trust beneficiaries, and the general public in this state; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The creation of a comprehensive trust institutions act serves the convenience and advantage of Washington state trust settlors and trust beneficiaries, and the state's general public, and preserves and maintains the fairness of competition and parity between Washington state-chartered banking institutions and trust companies, and federally chartered and out-of-state state-chartered banking institutions and trust companies.</p>

<p>The total loans and extensions of credit by a bank to a person outstanding at any one time shall not exceed twenty percent of the capital and surplus of such bank. A loan or extension of credit made by a bank does not violate this section if the loan or extension of credit would qualify for an exception to the lending limit for a national bank under rules adopted by the United States office of the comptroller of the currency, or successor federal agency with authority over national banks and federal savings associations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, the terms &quot;borrower,&quot; &quot;capital and surplus,&quot; &quot;derivative transaction,&quot; &quot;loans and extensions of credit,&quot; and &quot;person&quot; shall have the same meaning as those terms are defined in section 32.2 of Title 12 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations, 12 C.F.R. Sec. 32.2, except that &quot;loans and extensions of credit&quot; also includes repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions, or securities borrowing transactions between a bank and a borrower if the federal deposit insurance corporation requires such treatment for a state insured bank or the board of governors of the federal reserve system requires such treatment for member state banks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director may prescribe rules to administer and carry out the purposes of this section, including without limitation rules (a) to define or further define terms used in this section, (b) to establish limits or requirements other than those specified in this section for particular classes or categories of loans and extensions of credit, (c) to determine when a loan putatively made to a person shall, for purposes of this section, be attributed to another person, (d) to set standards for computation of time in relation to determining limits on loans and extensions of credit, and (e) to implement and incorporate other changes in limits on loans and extensions of credit necessary to conform to federal statute and rule required or otherwise authorized by this section. In adopting the rules, the director shall be guided by rulings of the United States comptroller of the currency, or successor federal banking regulator, that govern limits on loans and extensions of credit applicable to national banks and federal savings associations. In lieu of the adoption by the department of a rule applicable to specific types of transactions, a bank, unless otherwise approved by the director, shall conform to all applicable rulings of the comptroller of the currency, or successor federal banking regulator, which (i) relate to national banks and federal savings associations, (ii) govern such specific types of transactions or circumstances, and (iii) are consistent with this section and the department's adopted rules.</p>

<p>A loan or extension of credit that was within the limit on loans and extensions of credit when made is not a violation but will be treated as nonconforming if the loan or extension of credit is no longer in conformity with the bank's limit on loans and extensions of credit because:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The bank's capital has declined, borrowers have subsequently merged or formed a common enterprise, lenders have merged, or the limit on loans and extensions of credit or capital rules have changed; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collateral securing the loan or extension of credit, in order to satisfy the requirements of an exception to the limit, has declined in value.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bank shall make reasonable efforts to bring a loan or extension of credit that is nonconforming under (a)(i) of this subsection into conformity with the bank's limit on loans and extensions of credit unless to do so would be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bank must bring a loan or extension of credit that is nonconforming under (a)(ii) of this subsection into conformity with the bank's limit on loans and extensions of credit within thirty calendar days, except when judicial proceedings, regulatory actions, or other extraordinary circumstances beyond the bank's control prevent the bank or trust company from taking action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection (4), the director may by rule or interpretation prescribe standards for treatment of nonconforming extensions of credit that are derivatives transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions, or securities borrowing transactions, and may, if required for state insured banks or member state banks, rely upon rules or interpretations of the federal deposit insurance corporation or the board of governors of the federal reserve system, as applicable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, in the event that a bank's capital declines sufficiently to seriously impair the bank's ability to effectively operate in its marketplace or serve the needs of its customers or the community in which it is located, the director may, upon written application and in the exercise of the director's discretion, grant the bank temporary permission to fund loans and extensions of credit in excess of the bank's limit on loans and extensions of credit under this section. In the exercise of discretion, the director may further specify conditions for granting such emergency exception and may limit emergency lending authority under this section to particular types or classes of loans and extensions of credit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the director, in the exercise of discretion, may grant an exception to the limit on loans and extensions of credit otherwise required by this section, based on extenuating facts and circumstances. In deciding whether to grant an exception under this subsection, the director shall consider:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The proposed transaction for which the exception is sought;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How the requested exception would affect the capital adequacy and safety and soundness of the requesting bank if the exception is not granted or, if the exception is granted, if the proposed borrower should ultimately default;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How the requested exception would affect the loan portfolio diversification of the requesting bank;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The competency of management to handle the proposed transaction and any resulting safety and soundness issues;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The marketability and value of the proposed collateral; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The extenuating facts and circumstances that warrant an exception in light of the purpose of limit on loans and extensions of credit set forth in this section.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>A bank that desires to perform an activity that is not expressly authorized by subsection (1) of this section shall first apply to the director for authorization to conduct such activity. Within thirty days of the receipt of this application, the director shall determine whether the activity is closely related to the business of banking, whether the public convenience and advantage will be promoted, whether the activity is apt to create an unsafe and unsound practice by the bank and whether the applicant is capable of performing such an activity. If the director finds the activity to be closely related to the business of banking and the bank is otherwise qualified, he or she shall immediately inform the applicant that the activity is authorized. If the director determines that such activity is not closely related to the business of banking or that the bank is not otherwise qualified, he or she shall promptly inform the applicant in writing. The applicant shall have the right to appeal from an unfavorable determination in accordance with the procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act, chapter 34.05 RCW. In determining whether a particular activity is closely related to the business of banking, the director shall be guided by the rulings of the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the comptroller of the currency in making determinations in connection with the powers exercisable by bank holding companies, and the activities performed by other commercial banks or their holding companies.</p>

A bank may exercise the powers and authorities conferred on a federally chartered bank after July 28, 2013, only if the director finds that the exercise of such powers and authorities:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Serves the convenience and advantage of depositors, borrowers, or the general public; and</p>

<li>
<p>Maintains the fairness of competition and parity between state-chartered banks and federally chartered banks.</p>

<li>
<p>As used in this section, &quot;powers and authorities&quot; include without limitation powers and authorities in corporate governance and operational matters.</p>

<p>The restrictions, limitations, and requirements applicable to specific powers and authorities of federally chartered banks and out-of-state state banks, as applicable, shall apply to banks exercising those powers and authorities permitted under this section but only insofar as the restrictions, limitations, and requirements relate to exercising the powers and authorities granted banks solely under this section.</p>

<li>
<p>The director may require a bank to provide notice to the director prior to implementation of a plan to develop, improve, or continue holding real estate, including capitalized and operating leases, acquired through any means in full or partial satisfaction of a debt previously contracted, under circumstances which a national bank would be required to provide notice to the comptroller of the currency prior to implementation of such a plan. The director may adopt rules or issue orders, directives, standards, policies, memoranda, or other official communications to specify guidance with regard to the exercise of the powers and authorities to expend such funds as are needed to enable a bank to recover its total investment to the fullest extent authorized for a national bank under the national bank act, 12 U.S.C. Sec. 29.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any activity which may be performed by a bank, except the taking of deposits, may be performed by (a) a corporation or (b) another entity approved by the director, which in either case is owned in whole or in part by the bank.</p>

<p>A corporation or association organized under the laws of this state or licensed to transact business in the state may acquire any or all shares of stock of any bank or national banking association. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the merger, consolidation, or reorganization of a bank in accordance with this title.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless the terms of this section or RCW 30A.04.232 are complied with, an out-of-state bank holding company shall not acquire more than five percent of the shares of the voting stock or all or substantially all of the assets of a bank or national banking association the principal operations of which are conducted within this state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As used in this section a &quot;bank holding company&quot; means a company that is a bank holding company as defined by the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (12 U.S.C. Sec. 1841 et seq.). An &quot;out-of-state bank holding company&quot; is a bank holding company that principally conducts its operations outside this state, as measured by total deposits held or controlled by its bank subsidiaries on the date on which it became a holding company. A &quot;domestic bank holding company&quot; is a bank holding company that principally conducts its operations within this state, as measured by total deposits held or controlled by its bank subsidiaries on the date on which it became a bank holding company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any such acquisition referred to under subsection (2) of this section by an out-of-state bank holding company requires the express written approval of the director. Approval shall not be granted unless and until the following conditions are met:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>An out-of-state bank holding company desiring to make an acquisition referred to under subsection (2) of this section and the bank, national banking association, or domestic bank holding company parent thereof, if any, proposed to be acquired shall file an application in writing with the director. The director shall by rule establish the fee schedule to be collected from the applicant in connection with the application. The fee shall not exceed the cost of processing the application. The application shall contain such information as the director may prescribe by rule as necessary or appropriate for the purpose of making a determination under this section. The application and supporting information and all examination reports and information obtained by the director and the director's staff in conducting its investigation shall be confidential and privileged and not subject to public disclosure under chapter 42.56 RCW. The application and information may be disclosed to federal bank regulatory agencies and to officials empowered to investigate criminal charges, subject to legal process, valid search warrant, or subpoena. In any civil action in which such application or information is sought to be discovered or used as evidence, any party may, upon notice to the director and other parties, petition for an in camera review. The court may permit discovery and introduction of only those portions that are relevant and otherwise unobtainable by the requesting party. The application and information shall be discoverable in any judicial action challenging the approval of an acquisition by the director as arbitrary and capricious or unlawful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director shall find that:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The bank or national banking association that is proposed to be acquired or the domestic bank holding company controlling such bank or national banking association is in such a liquidity or financial condition as to be in danger of closing, failing, or insolvency. In making any such determination the director shall be guided by the criteria developed by the federal regulatory agencies with respect to emergency acquisitions under the provisions of 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1828(c);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no state bank or national banking association doing business in the state of Washington or domestic bank holding company with sufficient resources willing to acquire the entire bank or national banking association on at least as favorable terms as the out-of-state bank holding company is willing to acquire it;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The applicant out-of-state bank holding company has provided all information and documents requested by the director in relation to the application; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The applicant out-of-state bank holding company has demonstrated an acceptable record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of such institution.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director shall consider:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The financial institution structure of this state; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The convenience and needs of the public of this state.</p>
</li>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section may be construed to prohibit, limit, restrict, or subject to further regulation the ownership by a bank of the stock of a bank service corporation or a banker's bank.</p>
