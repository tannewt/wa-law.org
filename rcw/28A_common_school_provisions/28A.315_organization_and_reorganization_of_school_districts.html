<p>The financial oversight committee shall review the financial condition of a financially insolvent school district.

<p>After holding a public hearing as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the financial oversight committee must make a recommendation to the superintendent of public instruction to either dissolve a financially insolvent school district or to place a district under enhanced financial monitoring to reduce the risk of dissolution due to insolvency.

<p>Any action taken by a school district subject to enhanced financial monitoring that is likely to affect the district's finances is null and void if the action was not approved by the educational service district or special administrator or if the action is inconsistent with conditions imposed on the district pursuant to this section.</p>

<p>For outstanding voted bonded indebtedness of the financially insolvent school district, the board of directors of the receiving or annexing school district may determine that all or any portion of the voted bonded indebtedness be refunded pursuant to chapter 39.53 RCW, in which case the board of directors of the annexing or receiving district shall act as the governing body of the financially insolvent school district and is expressly empowered to take all action it deems necessary to accomplish such refunding; and</p>
