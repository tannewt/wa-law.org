<p>The purposes of RCW 28A.545.030 through 28A.545.110 and 84.52.0531 are to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Simplify the annual process of determining and paying the amounts due by nonhigh school districts to high school districts for educating students residing in a nonhigh school district;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide for a payment schedule that coincides to the extent practicable with the ability of nonhigh school districts to pay and the need of high school districts for payment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish that the maximum amount due per annual average full-time equivalent student by a nonhigh school district for each school year is the lesser of:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The enrichment levy rate per annual average full-time equivalent student levied upon the taxpayers of the high school district; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The enrichment levy rate per annual average full-time equivalent student levied upon the taxpayers of the nonhigh school district;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the nonhigh school district has not levied an enrichment levy during the current school year, then the amount due per annual average full-time equivalent student by the nonhigh school district is the enrichment levy rate per annual average full-time equivalent student levied upon the taxpayers of the high school district; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Designate the revenue provided to secondary school buildings to ensure dollars are being spent to support secondary school students.</p>
