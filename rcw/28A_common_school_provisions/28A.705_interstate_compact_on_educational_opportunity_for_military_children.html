<p>ARTICLE IV</p>
<p>EDUCATIONAL RECORDS AND ENROLLMENT</p>
<p>A. Unofficial or &quot;hand-carried&quot; education records – In the event that official education records cannot be released to the parents for the purpose of transfer, the custodian of the records in the sending state shall prepare and furnish to the parent a complete set of unofficial educational records containing uniform information as determined by the interstate commission. Upon receipt of the unofficial education records by a school in the receiving state, the school shall enroll and appropriately place the student based on the information provided in the unofficial records pending validation by the official records, as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>B. Official education records and transcripts -Simultaneous with the enrollment and conditional placement of the student, the school in the receiving state shall request the student's official education record from the school in the sending state. Upon receipt of this request, the school in the sending state will process and furnish the official education records to the school in the receiving state within ten days or within such time as is reasonably determined under the rules promulgated by the interstate commission. However, if the student has an unpaid fine at a public school or unpaid tuition, fees, or fines at a private school, then the sending school shall send the information requested but may withhold the official transcript until the monetary obligation is met.</p>
<p>C. Immunizations – On or before the first day of attendance, the parent or guardian must meet the immunization documentation requirements of the Washington board of health. Compacting states shall give thirty days from the date of enrollment or within such time as is reasonably determined under the rules promulgated by the interstate commission, for students to obtain any immunizations required by the receiving state. For a series of immunizations, initial vaccinations must be obtained within thirty days or within such time as is reasonably determined under the rules promulgated by the interstate commission.</p>
<p>D. Kindergarten and first grade entrance age – Students shall be allowed to continue their enrollment at grade level in the receiving state commensurate with their grade level (including kindergarten) from a local education agency in the sending state at the time of transition, regardless of age. A student who has satisfactorily completed the prerequisite grade level in the local education agency in the sending state shall be eligible for enrollment in the next highest grade level in the receiving state, regardless of age. A student transferring after the start of the school year in the receiving state shall enter the school in the receiving state on his or her validated level from an accredited school in the sending state.</p>
<p>ARTICLE V</p>
<p>PLACEMENT AND ATTENDANCE</p>
<p>A. Course placement - When the student transfers before or during the school year, the receiving state school shall initially honor placement of the student in educational courses based on the student's enrollment in the sending state school and/or educational assessments conducted at the school in the sending state if the courses are offered and if space is available, as determined by the school district. Course placement includes but is not limited to honors, international baccalaureate, advanced placement, vocational, technical, and career pathways courses. Continuing the student's academic program from the previous school and promoting placement in academically and career challenging courses should be paramount when considering placement. This does not preclude the school in the receiving state from performing subsequent evaluations to ensure appropriate placement and continued enrollment of the student in the courses.</p>
<p>B. Educational program placement – The receiving state school shall initially honor placement of the student in educational programs based on current educational assessments conducted at the school in the sending state or participation and placement in like programs in the sending state and if space is available, as determined by the school district. Such programs include, but are not limited to: (1) Gifted and talented programs; and (2) English as a second language (ESL). This does not preclude the school in the receiving state from performing subsequent evaluations to ensure appropriate placement of the student.</p>
<p>C. Special education services – (1) In compliance with the federal requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1400 et seq., the receiving state shall initially provide comparable services to a student with disabilities based on his or her current Individualized Education Program (IEP); and (2) in compliance with the requirements of section 504 of the rehabilitation act, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 794, and with Title II of the Americans with disabilities act, 42 U.S.C. Secs. 12131-12165, the receiving state shall make reasonable accommodations and modifications to address the needs of incoming students with disabilities, subject to an existing 504 or Title II plan, to provide the student with equal access to education. This does not preclude the school in the receiving state from performing subsequent evaluations to ensure appropriate placement of the student.</p>
<p>D. Placement flexibility – Local education agency administrative officials shall have flexibility in waiving course and program prerequisites, or other preconditions for placement in courses and programs offered under the jurisdiction of the local education agency.</p>
<p>E. Absence as related to deployment activities – A student whose parent or legal guardian is an active duty member of the uniformed services, as defined by this compact, and has been called to duty for, is on leave from, or immediately returned from deployment to a combat zone or combat support posting, shall be granted additional excused absences at the discretion of the local education agency superintendent to visit with his or her parent or legal guardian relative to such leave or deployment of the parent or guardian.</p>
<p>ARTICLE VI</p>
<p>ELIGIBILITY</p>
<p>A. Eligibility for enrollment</p>

<p>ARTICLE VII</p>
<p>GRADUATION</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the on-time graduation of children of military families, states and local education agencies shall incorporate the following procedures:</p>
<p>A. Waiver requirements – Local education agency administrative officials shall waive specific courses required for graduation if similar coursework has been satisfactorily completed in another local education agency or shall provide reasonable justification for denial. Should a waiver not be granted to a student who would qualify to graduate from the sending school, the local education agency shall use best efforts to provide an alternative means of acquiring required coursework so that graduation may occur on time.</p>
<p>B. Exit exams - For students entering high school in eleventh or twelfth grade, states shall accept: (1) Exit or end-of-course exams required for graduation from the sending state; or (2) national norm-referenced achievement tests; or (3) alternative testing, in lieu of testing requirements for graduation in the receiving state. In the event the above alternatives cannot be accommodated by the receiving state for a student transferring in his or her senior year, then the provisions of section C of this article shall apply.</p>
<p>C. Transfers during senior year – Should a military student transferring at the beginning or during his or her senior year be ineligible to graduate from the receiving local education agency after all alternatives have been considered, the sending and receiving local education agencies shall ensure the receipt of a diploma from the sending local education agency, if the student meets the graduation requirements of the sending local education agency. In the event that one of the states in question is not a member of this compact, the member state shall use best efforts to facilitate the on-time graduation of the student in accordance with sections A and B of this article.</p>
<p>ARTICLE VIII</p>
<p>STATE COORDINATION</p>
<p>A. Each member state shall, through the creation of a state council or use of an existing body or board, provide for the coordination among its agencies of government, local education agencies, and military installations concerning the state's participation in, and compliance with, this compact and interstate commission activities. While each member state may determine the membership of its own state council, its membership must include at least: The state superintendent of public instruction, a superintendent of a school district with a high concentration of military children, a representative from a military installation, one representative each from the legislative and executive branches of government, and other offices and stakeholder groups the state council deems appropriate. A member state that does not have a school district deemed to contain a high concentration of military children may appoint a superintendent from another school district to represent local education agencies on the state council.</p>
<p>B. The state council of each member state shall appoint or designate a military family education liaison to assist military families and the state in facilitating the implementation of this compact.</p>

<p>To the extent not covered by the state involved, member state, or the interstate commission, the representatives or employees of the interstate commission shall be held harmless in the amount of a settlement or judgment, including attorneys' fees and costs, obtained against such persons arising out of an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that such persons had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of such persons.</p>

</ol>
<p>ARTICLE XII</p>
<p>RULE-MAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION</p>
<p>A. Rule-making authority - The interstate commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the interstate commission exercises its rule-making authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this compact, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the interstate commission shall be invalid and have no force or effect.</p>
<p>B. Rule-making procedure - Rules shall be made pursuant to a rule-making process that substantially conforms to the &quot;model state administrative procedure act,&quot; of 1981, Uniform Laws Annotated, Vol. 15, p.1 (2000) as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the interstate commission.</p>
<p>C. Not later than thirty days after a rule is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule; provided, that the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the interstate commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the interstate commission's authority.</p>
<p>D. If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a rule by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any compacting state.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XIII</p>
<p>OVERSIGHT, ENFORCEMENT, AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p>
<p>A. Oversight</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce this compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent. The provisions of this compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the interstate commission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The interstate commission shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the interstate commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the interstate commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>B. Default, technical assistance, suspension, and termination - If the interstate commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, or the bylaws or promulgated rules, the interstate commission shall:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature of the default, the means of curing the default, and any action taken by the interstate commission. The interstate commission shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting state must cure its default;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suspension or termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the interstate commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state which has been suspended or terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of suspension or termination including obligations the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of suspension or termination;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to any state that has been found to be in default or which has been suspended or terminated from the compact, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the interstate commission and the defaulting state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The defaulting state may appeal the action of the interstate commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the interstate commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorneys' fees.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>C. Dispute Resolution</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The interstate commission shall attempt, upon the request of a member state, to resolve disputes which are subject to the compact and which may arise among member states and between member and nonmember states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The interstate commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>D. Enforcement</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The interstate commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The interstate commission, may by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United State[s] District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the interstate commission, in the federal district where the interstate commission has its principal offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, and its promulgated rules and bylaws, against a member state in default. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorneys' fees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the interstate commission. The interstate commission may avail itself of any other remedies available under state law or the regulation of a profession.</p>
</li>
</ol>

The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the interstate commission, which shall promulgate a rule binding upon all member states.</p>
<p>C. The interstate commission shall not incur obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the interstate commission pledge the credit of any of the member states, except by and with the authority of the member state.</p>
<p>D. The interstate commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the interstate commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws.
