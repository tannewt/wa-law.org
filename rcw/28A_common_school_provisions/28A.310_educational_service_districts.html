<p>The superintendent of public instruction upon his or her own initiative, or upon petition of any educational service district board, or upon petition of at least half of the district superintendents within an educational service district, or upon request of the state board of education, may make changes in the number and boundaries of the educational service districts, including an equitable adjustment and transfer of any and all property, assets, and liabilities among the educational service districts whose boundaries and duties and responsibilities are increased and/or decreased by such changes, consistent with the purposes of RCW 28A.310.010: PROVIDED, That no reduction in the number of educational service districts will take effect after June 30, 1995, without a majority approval vote by the affected school directors voting in such election by mail ballot. Prior to making any such changes, the superintendent of public instruction, or his or her designee, shall hold at least one public hearing on such proposed action and shall consider any recommendations on such proposed action.</p>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction in making any change in boundaries shall give consideration to, but not be limited by, the following factors: Size, population, topography, and climate of the proposed district.</p>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction shall furnish personnel, material, supplies, and information necessary to enable educational service district boards and superintendents to consider the proposed changes.</p>

<p>Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, in each educational service district there shall be an educational service district board consisting of seven members elected by the school directors of the educational service district, one from each of seven educational service district board-member districts. Board-member districts in districts reorganized under RCW 28A.310.020, or as provided for in RCW 28A.310.120 and under this section, shall be initially determined by the state board of education. If a reorganization pursuant to RCW 28A.310.020 places the residence of a board member into another or newly created educational service district, such member shall serve on the board of the educational service district of residence and at the next election called by the superintendent of public instruction pursuant to RCW 28A.310.080 a new seven member board shall be elected. If the redrawing of board-member district boundaries pursuant to this chapter shall cause the resident board-member district of two or more board members to coincide, such board members shall continue to serve on the board and at the next election called by the superintendent of public instruction a new board shall be elected. The board-member districts shall be arranged so far as practicable on a basis of equal population, with consideration being given existing board members of existing educational service district boards. Each educational service district board member shall be elected by the school directors of each school district within the educational service district. Beginning in 1971 and every ten years thereafter, educational service district boards shall review and, if necessary, shall change the boundaries of board-member districts so as to provide so far as practicable equal representation according to population of such board-member districts and to conform to school district boundary changes: PROVIDED, That all board-member district boundaries, to the extent necessary to conform with this chapter, shall be immediately redrawn for the purposes of the next election called by the superintendent of public instruction following any reorganization pursuant to this chapter. Such district board, if failing to make the necessary changes prior to June 1st of the appropriate year, shall refer for settlement questions on board-member district boundaries to the office of the superintendent of public instruction, which, after a public hearing, shall decide such questions.</p>

<p>It is the intent of the legislature that a basic core of uniform services be provided by educational service districts and be identified in statute so that biennial budget requests for educational service districts may be based upon measurable goals and needs. Educational service districts as noted in RCW 28A.310.010, are intended primarily to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Provide cooperative and informational services to local districts and to perform functions for those districts when such functions are more effectively or economically administered from the regional level;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assist the state educational agencies, office of superintendent of public instruction and the state board of education in the legal performance of their duties; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assist in providing pupils with equal educational opportunities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The purpose of RCW 28A.310.350 and 28A.310.360 is to further identify those core services in order to prepare educational service district budgets for the 1979-81 biennium, and those bienniums beyond.</p>
