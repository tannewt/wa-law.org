<li>
<p>The legislature finds that online learning provides tremendous opportunities for students to access curriculum, courses, and a unique learning environment that might not otherwise be available. The legislature supports and encourages online learning opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, the legislature also finds that there is a need to assure quality in online learning, both for the programs and the administration of those programs. The legislature is the steward of public funds that support students enrolled in online learning and must ensure an appropriate accountability system at the state level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to take a first step in improving oversight and quality assurance of online learning programs, and intends to examine possible additional steps that may need to be taken to improve financial accountability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first step in improving quality assurance is to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Provide objective information to students, parents, and educators regarding available online learning opportunities, including program and course content, how to register for programs and courses, teacher qualifications, student-to-teacher ratios, prior course completion rates, and other evaluative information;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create an approval process for online providers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhance statewide equity of student access to high quality online learning opportunities; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Require school district boards of directors to develop policies and procedures for student access to online learning opportunities.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction, in collaboration with the state board of education, shall develop and implement approval criteria and a process for approving online providers; a process for monitoring and if necessary rescinding the approval of courses or programs offered by an online provider; and an appeals process. The criteria and processes for multidistrict online providers shall be adopted by rule by December 1, 2009.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When developing the approval criteria, the superintendent of public instruction shall require that providers offering online courses or programs have accreditation, or are candidates for accreditation, through the Northwest accreditation commission or another national, regional, or state accreditation program listed by the office of the superintendent of public instruction. In addition to other criteria, the approval criteria shall include the degree of alignment with state academic standards and require that all teachers be certificated in accordance with Washington state law. When reviewing online providers that offer high school courses, the superintendent of public instruction shall assure that the courses offered by the provider are eligible for high school credit. However, final decisions regarding whether credit meets the school district's graduation requirements shall remain the responsibility of the school districts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initial approval of online providers by the superintendent of public instruction shall be for four years. The superintendent of public instruction shall develop a process for the renewal of approvals and for rescinding approvals based on noncompliance with approval requirements. Any multidistrict online provider that was approved by the digital learning commons or accredited by the Northwest association of accredited schools before July 26, 2009, and that meets the teacher certification requirements of subsection (2) of this section, is exempt from the initial approval process under this section until August 31, 2012, but must comply with the process for renewal of approvals and must comply with approval requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction shall make the first round of decisions regarding approval of multidistrict online providers by April 1, 2010. The first round of decisions regarding approval of online providers that are not multidistrict online providers shall be made by April 1, 2013. Thereafter, the superintendent of public instruction shall make annual approval decisions no later than November 1st of each year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction shall establish an online learning advisory committee within existing resources that shall provide advice to the superintendent regarding the approval criteria, major components of the website, the model school district policy, model agreements, and other related matters. The committee shall include a representative of each of the following groups: Private and public online providers, parents of online students, accreditation organizations, educational service districts, school principals, teachers, school administrators, school board members, institutions of higher education, and other individuals as determined by the superintendent. Members of the advisory committee shall be selected by the superintendent based on nominations from statewide organizations, shall serve three-year terms, and may be reappointed. The superintendent shall select the chair of the committee.</p>

<p>The superintendent of public instruction shall create an office of online learning.

The office shall:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Develop and maintain a website that provides objective information for students, parents, and educators regarding online learning opportunities offered by online providers that have been approved in accordance with RCW 28A.250.020.

</li>
<li>
<p>Develop model agreements with approved online providers that address standard contract terms and conditions that may apply to contracts between a school district and the approved provider. The purpose of the agreements is to provide a template to assist individual school districts, at the discretion of the district, in contracting with online providers to offer the online provider's courses and programs to students in the district. The agreements may address billing, fees, responsibilities of online course providers and school districts, and other issues; and</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>An online school program may request a waiver from the office of the superintendent of public instruction to administer one or more sections of the statewide student assessment for grades three through eight for some or all students enrolled in the program on alternate days or on an alternate schedule, as long as the administration is within the testing period established by the office. The office may deny a request for a waiver if the online school program's proposal does not maintain adequate test security or would reduce the reliability of the assessment results by providing an inequitable advantage for some students.</p>
