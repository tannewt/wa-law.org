<p>RCW 28A.180.010 through 28A.180.080 shall be known and cited as &quot;the transitional bilingual instruction act.&quot; The legislature finds that there are large numbers of children who come from homes where the primary language is other than English. The legislature finds that a transitional bilingual education program can meet the needs of these children. Pursuant to the policy of this state to insure equal educational opportunity to every child in this state, it is the purpose of RCW 28A.180.010 through 28A.180.080 to provide for the implementation of transitional bilingual education programs in the public schools.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Require school districts to assess potentially eligible pupils within ten days of registration using an English proficiency assessment or assessments as specified by the superintendent of public instruction.

<p>Require school districts to annually assess all eligible pupils at the end of the school year using an English proficiency assessment or assessments as specified by the superintendent of public instruction. Results of these assessments shall be made available to both the superintendent of public instruction and the school district;</p>

<li>
<p>Develop a system to evaluate increases in the English and academic proficiency of students who are, or were, eligible pupils. This evaluation shall include students when they are in the program and after they exit the program until they finish their K-12 career or transfer from the school district. The purpose of the evaluation system is to inform schools, school districts, parents, and the state of the effectiveness of the transitional bilingual programs in school and school districts in teaching these students English and other content areas, such as mathematics and writing; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to funds appropriated specifically for this purpose, provide school districts with technical assistance and support in selecting research-based program models, instructional materials, and professional development for program staff, including disseminating information about best practices and innovative programs.

</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, pilot projects must be implemented in one or two school districts east of the crest of the Cascade mountains and one or two school districts west of the crest of the Cascade mountains, where immigrant students are shown to be rapidly increasing. Districts selected by the Washington professional educator standards board must partner with at least one two-year and one four-year college in planning and implementing the program. The Washington professional educator standards board shall provide oversight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participating school districts must implement programs, including: (a) An outreach plan that exposes the program to middle school students and recruits them to enroll in the program when they begin their ninth grade of high school; (b) activities in ninth and tenth grades that help build student agency, such as self-confidence and awareness, while helping students to develop academic mind-sets needed for high school and college success; the value and benefits of teaching and counseling as careers; and introduction to leadership, civic engagement, and community service; (c) credit-bearing curricula in grades eleven and twelve that include mentoring, shadowing, best practices in teaching in a multicultural world, efficacy and practice of dual language instruction, social and emotional learning, enhanced leadership, civic engagement, and community service activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There must be a pipeline to college using two-year and four-year college faculty and consisting of continuation services for program participants, such as advising, tutoring, mentoring, financial assistance, and leadership.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High school and college teachers and counselors must be recruited and compensated to serve as mentors and trainers for participating students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After obtaining a high school diploma, students qualify to receive conditional loans to cover the full cost of college tuition, fees, and books. To qualify for funds, students must meet program requirements as developed by their local implementation team, which consists of staff from their school district and the partnering two-year and four-year college faculty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to avoid loan repayment, students must (a) earn their baccalaureate degree and certification needed to serve as a teacher or professional guidance counselor; and (b) teach or serve as a counselor in their educational service district region for at least five years. Students who do not meet the repayment terms in this subsection are subject to repaying all or part of the financial aid they receive for college unless students are recipients of funding provided through programs such as the Washington college grant program or the college bound scholarship program.</p>

<li>
<p>Grantees must work with the Washington professional educator standards board to draft the report required in section 6, chapter 236, Laws of 2017.</p>
