## 28A.900.100 - Purpose—1990 c 33.
1. The purpose of chapter 33, Laws of 1990 is to reorganize Title 28A RCW. There are three goals to this reorganization: (a) To place related sections in chapters organized by subject matter; (b) to make all terms gender neutral; and (c) to clarify existing language. Chapter 33, Laws of 1990 is technical in nature and is not intended to make substantive changes in the meaning, interpretation, court construction, or constitutionality of any provision of Title 28A RCW or other statutory provisions included in chapter 33, Laws of 1990 and rules adopted under those provisions.

2. Chapter 33, Laws of 1990 shall not have the effect of terminating or in any way modifying any proceedings or liability, civil or criminal, which exists on June 7, 1990.

\[ [1990 c 33 § 1](http://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1990c33.pdf?cite=1990%20c%2033%20§%201); \]

## 28A.900.101 - Statutory references—1990 c 33.

2. [Empty]
    a. References to "RCW 28A.47.732 through 28A.47.748" in Title 28A RCW have intentionally not been changed since those code sections were repealed by chapter 189, Laws of 1983. These references are not being eliminated because it is not the purpose of this act to correct obsolete references.

    b. References to "RCW 28A.58.095" in Title 28A RCW have intentionally not been changed since that code section was repealed by chapter 2, Laws of 1987 1st ex. sess. These references are not being eliminated because it is not the purpose of this act to correct obsolete references.

\[ [1990 c 33 § 2](http://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1990c33.pdf?cite=1990%20c%2033%20§%202); \]

## 28A.900.102 - Severability—1990 c 33.

\[ [1990 c 33 § 603](http://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1990c33.pdf?cite=1990%20c%2033%20§%20603); \]

## 28A.900.105 - Effect of repeal—1995 c 335.
The repeal of any programs that are not funded as of July 23, 1995, is not intended to comment on the value of the services provided by the programs. The repeal of statutes in chapter 335, Laws of 1995 does not affect the general authority of school districts to provide services to accomplish the purposes of these programs. The deletion or repeal of language that permitted school districts to carry out specific activities that would be within their general authority is not intended to affect the general authority of school districts to continue to carry out those activities.
