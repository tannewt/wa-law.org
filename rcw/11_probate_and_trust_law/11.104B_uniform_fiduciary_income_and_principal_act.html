<p>The court may not order a fiduciary to change a fiduciary decision unless the court determines that the fiduciary decision was an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court determines that a fiduciary decision was an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion, the court may order a remedy authorized by law. To place the beneficiaries in the positions the beneficiaries would have occupied if there had not been an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion, the court may order:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The fiduciary to exercise or refrain from exercising the power to adjust under RCW 11.104B.070;</p>

<p>The fiduciary to distribute an amount to a beneficiary;</p>

<li>
<p>The fiduciary to withhold an amount from one or more future distributions to a beneficiary.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>On petition by a fiduciary for instruction, the court may determine whether a proposed fiduciary decision will result in an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion. If the petition describes the proposed decision, contains sufficient information to inform the beneficiary of the reasons for making the proposed decision and the facts on which the fiduciary relies, and explains how the beneficiary will be affected by the proposed decision, a beneficiary that opposes the proposed decision has the burden to establish that it will result in an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion.</p>

<li>
<p>A fiduciary may not reduce principal or income receipts from property described in subsection (2) of this section because of a payment described in RCW 11.104B.400 or 11.104B.410, to the extent the decedent's will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law requires the fiduciary to make the payment from assets other than the property or to the extent the fiduciary recovers or expects to recover the payment from a third party. The net income and principal receipts from the property must be determined by including the amount the fiduciary receives or pays regarding the property, whether the amount accrued or became due before, on, or after the date of the decedent's death or an income interest's terminating event, and making a reasonable provision for an amount the estate or income interest may become obligated to pay after the property is distributed.</p>

<p>Except to the extent Article 3 of this chapter applies for a beneficiary that is a trust, each beneficiary described in RCW 11.104B.500(6) is entitled to receive a share of the net income equal to the beneficiary's fractional interest in undistributed principal assets, using values as of the distribution date. If a fiduciary makes more than one distribution of assets to beneficiaries to which this section applies, each beneficiary, including a beneficiary that does not receive part of the distribution, is entitled, as of each distribution date, to a share of the net income the fiduciary received after the decedent's death, an income interest's other terminating event, or the preceding distribution by the fiduciary.</p>

<p>In determining a beneficiary's share of net income under subsection (1) of this section, the following rules apply:</p>

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The distribution date under (a) of this subsection may be the date as of which the fiduciary calculates the value of the assets if that date is reasonably near the date on which the assets are distributed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the extent a fiduciary does not distribute under this section all the collected but undistributed net income to each beneficiary as of a distribution date, the fiduciary shall maintain records showing the interest of each beneficiary in the net income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If this section applies to income from an asset, a fiduciary may apply the rules in this section to net gain or loss realized from the disposition of the asset after the decedent's death, an income interest's terminating event, or the preceding distribution by the fiduciary.</p>
