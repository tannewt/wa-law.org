<p>It is the intent of the legislature to protect the liberty and autonomy of all people of this state, and to enable them to exercise their rights under the law to the maximum extent, consistent with the capacity of each person. The legislature recognizes that people with incapacities have unique abilities and needs, and that some people with incapacities cannot exercise their rights or provide for their basic needs without the help of a guardian. However, their liberty and autonomy should be restricted through the guardianship process only to the minimum extent necessary to adequately provide for their own health or safety, or to adequately manage their financial affairs.</p>

<li>
<p>The superior court of each county shall have power to appoint guardians for the persons and/or estates of incapacitated persons, and guardians for the estates of nonresidents of the state who have property in the county needing care and attention.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>For purposes of this chapter, a person may be deemed incapacitated as to person when the superior court determines the individual has a significant risk of personal harm based upon a demonstrated inability to adequately provide for nutrition, health, housing, or physical safety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this chapter, a person may be deemed incapacitated as to the person's estate when the superior court determines the individual is at significant risk of financial harm based upon a demonstrated inability to adequately manage property or financial affairs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A determination of incapacity is a legal not a medical decision, based upon a demonstration of management insufficiencies over time in the area of person or estate. Age, eccentricity, poverty, or medical diagnosis alone shall not be sufficient to justify a finding of incapacity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person may also be determined incapacitated if he or she is under the age of majority as defined in RCW 26.28.010.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of giving informed consent for health care pursuant to RCW 7.70.050 and 7.70.065, an &quot;incompetent&quot; person is any person who is (i) incompetent by reason of mental illness, developmental disability, senility, habitual drunkenness, excessive use of drugs, or other mental incapacity, of either managing his or her property or caring for himself or herself, or both, or (ii) incapacitated as defined in (a), (b), or (d) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of the terms &quot;incompetent,&quot; &quot;disabled,&quot; or &quot;not legally competent,&quot; as those terms are used in the Revised Code of Washington to apply to persons incapacitated under this chapter, those terms shall be interpreted to mean &quot;incapacitated&quot; persons for purposes of this chapter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The superior court for each county shall have power to appoint limited guardians for the persons and estates, or either thereof, of incapacitated persons, who by reason of their incapacity have need for protection and assistance, but who are capable of managing some of their personal and financial affairs. After considering all evidence presented as a result of such investigation, the court shall impose, by order, only such specific limitations and restrictions on an incapacitated person to be placed under a limited guardianship as the court finds necessary for such person's protection and assistance. A person shall not be presumed to be incapacitated nor shall a person lose any legal rights or suffer any legal disabilities as the result of being placed under a limited guardianship, except as to those rights and disabilities specifically set forth in the court order establishing such a limited guardianship. In addition, the court order shall state the period of time for which it shall be applicable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Venue for petitions for guardianship or limited guardianship shall lie in the county wherein the alleged incapacitated person is domiciled, or if such person resides in a facility supported in whole or in part by local, state, or federal funding sources, in either the county where the facility is located, the county of domicile prior to residence in the supported facility, or the county where a parent or spouse or domestic partner of the alleged incapacitated person is domiciled.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the alleged incapacitated person's residency has changed within one year of the filing of the petition, any interested person may move for a change of venue for any proceedings seeking the appointment of a guardian or a limited guardian under this chapter to the county of the alleged incapacitated person's last place of residence of one year or more. The motion shall be granted when it appears to the court that such venue would be in the best interests of the alleged incapacitated person and would promote more complete consideration of all relevant matters.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>Under RCW 11.125.080, a principal may nominate, by a durable power of attorney, the guardian or limited guardian of his or her estate or person for consideration by the court if guardianship proceedings for the principal's person or estate are thereafter commenced. The court shall make its appointment in accordance with the principal's most recent nomination in a durable power of attorney except for good cause or disqualification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imposition of a guardianship for an incapacitated person shall not result in the loss of the right to vote unless the court determines that the person is incompetent for purposes of rationally exercising the franchise in that the individual lacks the capacity to understand the nature and effect of voting such that she or he cannot make an individual choice. The court order establishing guardianship shall specify whether or not the individual retains voting rights. When a court determines that the person is incompetent for the purpose of rationally exercising the right to vote, the court shall notify the appropriate county auditor.</p>

<li>
<p>A parent, if the alleged incapacitated person is a minor, all known children not residing with a notified person, and the spouse or domestic partner of the alleged incapacitated person if any;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any other person who has been appointed as guardian or limited guardian, or the person with whom the alleged incapacitated person resides.

<p>Alleged incapacitated individuals shall have the right to be represented by willing counsel of their choosing at any stage in guardianship proceedings. The court shall provide counsel to represent any alleged incapacitated person at public expense when either: (i) The individual is unable to afford counsel, or (ii) the expense of counsel would result in substantial hardship to the individual, or (iii) the individual does not have practical access to funds with which to pay counsel. If the individual can afford counsel but lacks practical access to funds, the court shall provide counsel and may impose a reimbursement requirement as part of a final order. When, in the opinion of the court, the rights and interests of an alleged or adjudicated incapacitated person cannot otherwise be adequately protected and represented, the court on its own motion shall appoint an attorney at any time to represent such person. Counsel shall be provided as soon as practicable after a petition is filed and long enough before any final hearing to allow adequate time for consultation and preparation. Absent a convincing showing in the record to the contrary, a period of less than three weeks shall be presumed by a reviewing court to be inadequate time for consultation and preparation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Counsel for an alleged incapacitated individual shall act as an advocate for the client and shall not substitute counsel's own judgment for that of the client on the subject of what may be in the client's best interests. Counsel's role shall be distinct from that of the guardian ad litem, who is expected to promote the best interest of the alleged incapacitated individual, rather than the alleged incapacitated individual's expressed preferences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an alleged incapacitated person is represented by counsel and does not communicate with counsel, counsel may ask the court for leave to withdraw for that reason. If satisfied, after affording the alleged incapacitated person an opportunity for a hearing, that the request is justified, the court may grant the request and allow the case to proceed with the alleged incapacitated person unrepresented.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the pendency of any guardianship, any attorney purporting to represent a person alleged or adjudicated to be incapacitated shall petition to be appointed to represent the incapacitated or alleged incapacitated person. Fees for representation described in this section shall be subject to approval by the court pursuant to the provisions of RCW 11.92.180.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The alleged incapacitated person is further entitled to testify and present evidence and, upon request, entitled to a jury trial on the issues of his or her alleged incapacity. The standard of proof to be applied in a contested case, whether before a jury or the court, shall be that of clear, cogent, and convincing evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In all proceedings for appointment of a guardian or limited guardian, the court must be presented with a written report from a physician licensed to practice under chapter 18.71 or 18.57 RCW, psychologist licensed under chapter 18.83 RCW, or advanced registered nurse practitioner licensed under chapter 18.79 RCW, selected by the guardian ad litem. If the alleged incapacitated person opposes the health care professional selected by the guardian ad litem to prepare the medical report, then the guardian ad litem shall use the health care professional selected by the alleged incapacitated person. The guardian ad litem may also obtain a supplemental examination. The physician, psychologist, or advanced registered nurse practitioner shall have personally examined and interviewed the alleged incapacitated person within thirty days of preparation of the report to the court and shall have expertise in the type of disorder or incapacity the alleged incapacitated person is believed to have. The report shall contain the following information and shall be set forth in substantially the following format:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The name and address of the examining physician, psychologist, or advanced registered nurse practitioner;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The education and experience of the physician, psychologist, or advanced registered nurse practitioner pertinent to the case;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dates of examinations of the alleged incapacitated person;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A summary of the relevant medical, functional, neurological, or mental health history of the alleged incapacitated person as known to the examining physician, psychologist, or advanced registered nurse practitioner;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The findings of the examining physician, psychologist, or advanced registered nurse practitioner as to the condition of the alleged incapacitated person;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Current medications;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The effect of current medications on the alleged incapacitated person's ability to understand or participate in guardianship proceedings;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opinions on the specific assistance the alleged incapacitated person needs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identification of persons with whom the physician, psychologist, or advanced registered nurse practitioner has met or spoken regarding the alleged incapacitated person.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The court shall not enter an order appointing a guardian or limited guardian until a medical or mental status report meeting the above requirements is filed.</p>
<p>The requirement of filing a medical report is waived if the basis of the guardianship is minority.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>During the pendency of an action to establish a guardianship, a petitioner or any person may move for temporary relief under chapter 7.40 RCW, to protect the alleged incapacitated person from abuse, neglect, abandonment, or exploitation, as those terms are defined in RCW 74.34.020, or to address any other emergency needs of the alleged incapacitated person. Any alternative arrangement executed before filing the petition for guardianship shall remain effective unless the court grants the relief requested under chapter 7.40 RCW, or unless, following notice and a hearing at which all parties directly affected by the arrangement are present, the court finds that the alternative arrangement should not remain effective.</li>

<p>When either parent is deceased, the surviving parent of any minor child or a sole parent of a minor child, may by last will or durable power of attorney nominate a guardian or guardians of the person, or of the estate or both, of a minor child, whether born at the time of executing the instrument or afterwards, to continue during the minority of such child or for any less time. This nomination shall be effective in the event of the death or incapacity of such parent.

The court shall confirm the parent's nomination unless the court finds, based upon evidence presented at a hearing on the matter, that the individual nominated in the surviving parent's will or durable power of attorney is not qualified to serve. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of a will nominating a testamentary guardian under the authority of this section and the nomination of a guardian under RCW 11.125.410, the most recent designation shall control.

Within three days of the later of the actual service or filing of the guardian ad litem's statement, any party may set a hearing and file and serve a motion for an order to show cause why the guardian ad litem should not be removed for one of the following three reasons: (i) Lack of expertise necessary for the proceeding; (ii) an hourly rate higher than what is reasonable for the particular proceeding; or (iii) a conflict of interest. Notice of the hearing shall be provided to the guardian ad litem and all parties. If, after a hearing, the court enters an order replacing the guardian ad litem, findings shall be included, expressly stating the reasons for the removal. If the guardian ad litem is not removed, the court has the authority to assess to the moving party, attorneys' fees and costs related to the motion. The court shall assess attorneys' fees and costs for frivolous motions.</p>

<p>At any time after establishment of a guardianship or appointment of a guardian, the court may, upon the death of the guardian or limited guardian, or, for other good reason, modify or terminate the guardianship or replace the guardian or limited guardian or modify the authority of a guardian or limited guardian. Such action may be taken based on the court's own motion, based on a motion by an attorney for a person or entity, based on a motion of a person or entity representing themselves, or based on a written complaint, as described in this section. The court may grant relief under this section as it deems just and in the best interest of the incapacitated person. For any hearing to modify or terminate a guardianship, the incapacitated person shall be given reasonable notice of the hearing and of the incapacitated person's right to be represented at the hearing by counsel of his or her own choosing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court must modify or terminate a guardianship when a less restrictive alternative, such as a power of attorney or a trust, will adequately provide for the needs of the incapacitated person. In any motion to modify or terminate a guardianship with a less restrictive alternative, the court should consider any recent medical reports; whether a condition is reversible; testimony of the incapacitated person; testimony of persons most closely related by blood, marriage, or state registered domestic partnership to the incapacitated person; testimony of persons entitled to notice of special proceedings under RCW 11.92.150; and other needs of the incapacitated person that are not adequately served in a guardianship or limited guardianship that may be better served with a less restrictive alternative. All motions under the provisions of this subsection (1)(b) must be heard within sixty days unless an extension of time is requested by a party or a guardian ad litem within such sixty-day period and granted for good cause shown. An extension granted for good cause should not exceed an additional sixty days from the date of the request of the extension, and the court must set a new hearing date.</p>

<p>An unrepresented person or entity may submit a complaint to the court. Complaints must be addressed to one of the following designees of the court: The clerk of the court having jurisdiction in the guardianship, the court administrator, or the guardianship monitoring program, and must identify the complainant and the incapacitated person who is the subject of the guardianship. The complaint must also provide the complainant's address, the case number (if available), and the address of the incapacitated person (if available). The complaint must state facts to support the claim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By the next judicial day after receipt of a complaint from an unrepresented person, the court's designee must ensure the original complaint is filed and deliver the complaint to the court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within fourteen days of being presented with a complaint, the court must enter an order to do one or more of the following actions:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>To show cause, with fourteen days' notice, directing the guardian to appear at a hearing set by the court in order to respond to the complaint;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To appoint a guardian ad litem to investigate the issues raised by the complaint or to take any emergency action the court deems necessary to protect the incapacitated person until a hearing can be held;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To dismiss the complaint without scheduling a hearing, if it appears to the court that the complaint: Is without merit on its face; is filed in other than good faith; is filed for an improper purpose; regards issues that have already been adjudicated; or is frivolous. In making a determination, the court may review the matter and consider previous behavior of the complainant that is documented in the guardianship record;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To direct the guardian to provide, in not less than fourteen days, a written report to the court on the issues raised in the complaint;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To defer consideration of the complaint until the next regularly scheduled hearing in the guardianship, if the date of that hearing is within the next three months, provided that there is no indication that the incapacitated person will suffer physical, emotional, financial, or other harm as a result of the court's deferral of consideration;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To order other action, in the court's discretion, in addition to doing one or more of the actions set out in this subsection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If after consideration of the complaint, the court believes that the complaint is made without justification or for reason to harass or delay or with malice or other bad faith, the court has the power to levy necessary sanctions, including but not limited to the imposition of reasonable attorney fees, costs, fees, striking pleadings, or other appropriate relief.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court may order persons who have been removed as guardians to deliver any property or records belonging to the incapacitated person in accordance with the court's order. Similarly, when guardians have died or been removed and property or records of an incapacitated person are being held by any other person, the court may order that person to deliver it in accordance with the court's order. Disobedience of an order to deliver is punishable as contempt of court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The administrative office of the courts must develop and prepare, in consultation with interested persons, a model form for the complaint described in subsection (2)(a) of this section and a model form for the order that must be issued by the court under subsection (2)(c) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board may send a grievance it has received regarding an active guardian case to the court's designee with a request that the court review the grievance and take any action the court deems necessary. This type of request from the board must be treated as a complaint under this section and the person who sent the complaint must be treated as the complainant. The court must direct the clerk to transmit a copy of its order to the board. The board must consider the court order when taking any further action and note the court order in any final determination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In any court action under this section that involves a professional guardian, the court must direct the clerk of the court to send a copy of the order entered under this section to the board.</p>

<li>
<p>The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</p>

<p>TERMINATION OF GUARDIANSHIP FOR A MINOR BY DECLARATION OF COMPLETION. A guardianship for the benefit of a minor may be terminated upon the minor's attainment of legal age, as defined in RCW 26.28.010 as now or hereafter amended, by the guardian filing a declaration that states:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The date the minor attained legal age;</p>

<li>
<p>That the guardian has paid all of the minor's funds in the guardian's possession to the minor, who has signed a receipt for the funds, and that the receipt has been filed with the court;</p>

<p>Guardian</p>
<p>If the minor, after reaching legal age, waives in writing the notice required by this section, the guardian will be automatically discharged without further order of the court and the declaration of completion of guardianship will be effective as an order terminating the guardianship without an accounting upon filing the declaration. If the guardian has been required to furnish a bond, and a declaration of completion of guardianship is filed according to this section, any bond furnished by the guardian shall be automatically discharged upon the discharge of the guardian.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>TERMINATION ON COURT ORDER. A guardianship or limited guardianship may be terminated by court order after such notice as the court may require if the guardianship or limited guardianship is no longer necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>The guardian or limited guardian shall, within ninety days of the date of termination of the guardianship, unless the court orders a different deadline for good cause, prepare and file with the court a final verified account of administration. The final verified account of administration shall contain the same information as required for (a) an intermediate verified account of administration of the estate under RCW 11.92.040(2) and (b) an intermediate personal care status report under *RCW 11.92.043(2).</p>

When a guardianship or limited guardianship terminates other than by the death of the incapacitated person, the powers of the guardian or limited guardian cease, except that a guardian or limited guardian of the estate may make disbursements for claims that are or may be allowed by the court, for liabilities already properly incurred for the estate or for the incapacitated person, and for expenses of administration. When a guardianship or limited guardianship terminates by death of the incapacitated person, the guardian or limited guardian of the estate may proceed under RCW 11.88.150 as now or hereafter amended, but the rights of all creditors against the incapacitated person's estate shall be determined by the law of decedents' estates.</li>

<p>Upon the death of an incapacitated person, a guardian or limited guardian of the estate shall have authority to disburse or commit those funds under the control of the guardian or limited guardian as are prudent and within the means of the estate for the disposition of the deceased incapacitated person's remains. Consent for such arrangement shall be secured according to RCW 68.50.160. If no person authorized by *RCW 68.50.150 accepts responsibility for giving consent, the guardian or limited guardian of the estate may consent, subject to the provisions of this section and to the known directives of the deceased incapacitated person. Reasonable financial commitments made by a guardian or limited guardian pursuant to this section shall be binding against the estate of the deceased incapacitated person.</p>

<p>Upon the death of an incapacitated person intestate the guardian or limited guardian of his or her estate has power under the letters issued to him or her and subject to the direction of the court to administer the estate as the estate of the deceased incapacitated person without further letters unless within forty days after death of the incapacitated person a petition is filed for letters of administration or for letters testamentary and the petition is granted. If the guardian or limited guardian elects to administer the estate under his or her letters of guardianship or limited guardianship, he or she shall petition the court for an order transferring the guardianship or limited guardianship proceeding to a probate proceeding, and upon court approval, the clerk of the court shall reindex the cause as a decedent's estate, using the same file number which was assigned to the guardianship or limited guardianship proceeding. The guardian or limited guardian shall then be authorized to continue administration of the estate without the necessity for any further petition or hearing. Notice to creditors and other persons interested in the estate shall be published and may be combined with the notice of the guardian's or limited guardian's final account. This notice shall be given and published in the manner provided in chapter 11.40 RCW. Upon the hearing, the account may be allowed and the balance distributed to the persons entitled thereto, after the payment of such claims as may be allowed. Liability on the guardian's or limited guardian's bond shall continue until exonerated on settlement of his or her account, and may apply to the complete administration of the estate of the deceased incapacitated person with the consent of the surety. If letters of administration are granted upon petition filed within forty days after the death of the incapacitated person, the personal representative shall supersede the guardian or limited guardian in the administration of the estate and the estate shall be administered as a decedent's estate as provided in this title, including the publication of notice to creditors and other interested persons and the barring of creditors claims.</p>
