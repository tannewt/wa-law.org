<li>
<p>Subject to community property rights, upon the death of an owner the owner's interest in any nonprobate asset specifically referred to in the owner's will belongs to the testamentary beneficiary named to receive the nonprobate asset, notwithstanding the rights of any beneficiary designated before the date of the will.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A general residuary gift in an owner's will, or a will making general disposition of all of the owner's property, does not entitle the devisees or legatees to receive nonprobate assets of the owner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A disposition in a will of the owner's interest in &quot;all nonprobate assets&quot; or of all of a category of nonprobate asset under RCW 11.11.010(7), such as &quot;all of my payable on death bank accounts&quot; or similar language, is deemed to be a disposition of all the nonprobate assets the beneficiaries of which are designated before the date of the will.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the owner designates a beneficiary for a nonprobate asset after the date of the will, the specific provisions in the will that attempt to control the disposition of that asset do not govern the disposition of that nonprobate asset, even if the subsequent beneficiary designation is later revoked. If the owner revokes the later beneficiary designation, and there is no other provision controlling the disposition of the asset, the asset shall be treated as any other general asset of the owner's estate, subject to disposition under the other applicable provisions of the will. A beneficiary designation with respect to an asset that renews without the signature of the owner is deemed to have been made on the date on which the account was first opened.</p>

<p>In transferring nonprobate assets, a personal representative, a financial institution, or other third party may rely conclusively and entirely upon the form of the nonprobate asset and the terms of the nonprobate asset arrangement in effect on the date of death of the owner, and a personal representative or third party may rely on information provided by a financial institution or other party who has possession or control of a nonprobate asset concerning the form of the nonprobate asset and the terms of the nonprobate asset arrangement in effect on the date of death of the owner, unless the personal representative, financial institution, or other third party has actual knowledge of the existence of a claim by a testamentary beneficiary. A financial institution or other third party is not required to inquire as to either the source or ownership of any nonprobate asset in its possession or under its control, or as to the proposed application of an asset so transferred. A transfer of a nonprobate asset in accordance with this section constitutes a complete release and discharge of the financial institution or other third party from all claims relating to the nonprobate asset, regardless of whether or not the transfer is consistent with the actual ownership of the nonprobate asset.</p>

<p>A financial institution's or third party's obligation to transfer a nonprobate asset to a testamentary beneficiary arises only after it has actual knowledge of the claim of the testamentary beneficiary, and after receiving written direction from the personal representative of the owner's estate, or if the personal representative consents in writing, from the testamentary beneficiary, to make the transfer. The financial institution may also require that its customary procedures be followed in effectuating a transfer of the nonprobate asset.</p>

<li>
<p>Subject to subsection (1) of this section, financial institutions and other third parties may transfer a nonprobate asset that has not already been distributed to the testamentary beneficiary entitled to the nonprobate asset under the owner's will, subject to liabilities and claims, estate taxes, and expenses of administration under RCW 11.18.200.</p>

<p>This chapter does not require any financial institution or other third party to transfer a nonprobate asset to a beneficiary, testamentary beneficiary, or other person claiming an interest in the nonprobate asset if the financial institution or third party has actual knowledge of the existence of a dispute between beneficiaries, testamentary beneficiaries, or other persons concerning rights or ownership to the nonprobate asset under this chapter, or if the financial institution or third party is otherwise uncertain as to who is entitled to receive the nonprobate asset under this chapter. In any such case, the financial institution or third party may, without liability, notify in writing all beneficiaries, testamentary beneficiaries, or other persons claiming an interest in the nonprobate asset of either its uncertainty as to who is entitled to transfer of the nonprobate asset or the existence of any dispute, and it may also, without liability, refuse to transfer a nonprobate asset to a beneficiary or a testamentary beneficiary until such time as either:</p>
