<li>
<p>The net amount allocated to income under the other sections in this chapter and the increase or decrease in the value of the principal assets, which the trustee may estimate as to assets for which market values are not readily available;</p>

<li>
<p>Whether and to what extent the terms of the trust give the trustee the power to invade principal or accumulate income or prohibit the trustee from invading principal or accumulating income, and the extent to which the trustee has exercised a power from time to time to invade principal or accumulate income;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The actual and anticipated effect of economic conditions on principal and income and effects of inflation and deflation; and</p>

<p>The anticipated tax consequences of an adjustment.</p>

<li>A trustee may not make an adjustment:</li>

<p>That diminishes the income interest in a trust that requires all of the income to be paid at least annually to a spouse and for which an estate tax or gift tax marital deduction would be allowed, in whole or in part, if the trustee did not have the power to make the adjustment;</p>

<p>If possessing or exercising the power to make an adjustment causes all or part of the trust assets to be included for estate tax purposes in the estate of an individual who has the power to remove a trustee or appoint a trustee, or both, and the assets would not be included in the estate of the individual if the trustee did not possess the power to make an adjustment;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>A personal representative serving with nonintervention powers under chapter 11.68 RCW may adjust between principal and income to the extent the personal representative considers necessary, if the personal representative invests and manages assets of the estate as a prudent investor and the personal representative determines, after applying the rules of RCW 11.104A.010(a), that the personal representative is unable to comply with RCW 11.104A.010(b). In deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power conferred by this subsection, the personal representative shall consider all factors relevant to the estate and its beneficiaries, including factors comparable to those a trustee would consider under subsection (b) of this section if considering such an adjustment. A personal representative may not make an adjustment under circumstances comparable to those that are described in subsection (c) of this section and that prohibit a trustee from making such an adjustment, although a copersonal representative, or an additional personal representative who is appointed by a court order, a binding agreement, or otherwise under chapter 11.96A RCW, to whom such limitations do not apply may make the adjustment unless the exercise of the power by the remaining personal representative or personal representatives is not permitted by the terms of a will.</p>

<p>A fiduciary may release the entire power conferred by subsection (a) of this section or may release only the power to adjust from income to principal or the power to adjust from principal to income if the fiduciary is uncertain about whether possessing or exercising the power will cause a result described in subsection (c)(1) through (6) or (8) of this section or if the fiduciary determines that possessing or exercising the power will or may deprive the trust of a tax benefit or impose a tax burden not described in subsection (c) of this section.

<p>Terms of a trust that limit the power of a fiduciary to make an adjustment between principal and income do not affect the application of this section unless it is clear from the terms of the trust that the terms are intended to deny the fiduciary the power of adjustment conferred by subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<p>A fiduciary of an estate or of a terminating income interest shall determine the amount of net income and net principal receipts received from property specifically given to a beneficiary under the rules in Articles 3 through 5 of this chapter which apply to trustees and the rules in subsection (5) of this section. The fiduciary shall distribute the net income and net principal receipts to the beneficiary who is to receive the specific property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A fiduciary shall determine the remaining net income of a decedent's estate or a terminating income interest under the rules in Articles 3 through 5 of this chapter which apply to trustees, except to the extent that the following apply:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The fiduciary shall include in net income all income from property used to discharge liabilities;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The fiduciary shall pay from principal all other disbursements made or incurred in connection with the settlement of a decedent's estate or the winding up of a terminating income interest, including debts, funeral expenses, disposition of remains, and death taxes and related penalties that are apportioned to the estate or terminating income interest by the will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>A fiduciary shall distribute to a beneficiary who receives a pecuniary amount outright the interest or any other amount provided by the will, the terms of a trust, or applicable law from net income determined under subsection (2) of this section or from principal to the extent that net income is insufficient. Otherwise, no outright gift of a pecuniary amount whether under a will, or under a trust after an income interest ends shall receive interest or any other income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A fiduciary shall distribute the net income remaining after distributions required by subsection (3) of this section in the manner described in RCW 11.104A.060 to all other beneficiaries, including a beneficiary who receives a pecuniary amount in trust, even if the beneficiary holds an unqualified power to withdraw assets from the trust or other presently exercisable general power of appointment over the trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A fiduciary may not reduce principal or income receipts from property described in subsection (1) of this section because of a payment described in RCW 11.104A.250 or 11.104A.260 to the extent that the will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law requires the fiduciary to make the payment from assets other than the property or to the extent that the fiduciary recovers or expects to recover the payment from a third party. The net income and principal receipts from the property are determined by including all of the amounts the fiduciary receives or pays with respect to the property, whether those amounts accrued or became due before, on, or after the date of a decedent's death or an income interest's terminating event, and by making a reasonable provision for amounts that the fiduciary believes the estate or terminating income interest may become obligated to pay after the property is distributed.</p>

For purposes of subsections (d), (e), (f), and (g) of this section, the term also includes any payment from any separate fund, regardless of the reason for the payment.</p>

<li>
<p>&quot;Separate fund&quot; includes a private or commercial annuity, an individual retirement account, and a pension, profit-sharing, stock-bonus, or stock-ownership plan.</p>

<p>To the extent that a payment is characterized as interest, a dividend, or a payment made in lieu of interest or a dividend, a trustee shall allocate the payment to income.

<p>If a trustee cannot determine the internal income of a separate fund but can determine the value of the separate fund, the internal income of the separate fund is deemed to equal four percent of the fund's value, according to the most recent statement of value preceding the beginning of the accounting period. If the trustee can determine neither the internal income of the separate fund nor the fund's value, the internal income of the fund is deemed to equal the product of the interest rate and the present value of the expected future payments, as determined under 26 U.S.C.
