<ol>
<li>
<p>Subject to RCW 11.54.030, the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner of a decedent may petition the court for an award from the property of the decedent. If the decedent is survived by children of the decedent who are not also the children of the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner, on petition of such a child the court may divide the award between the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner and all or any of such children as it deems appropriate. If there is not a surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner, the minor children of the decedent may petition for an award.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The award may be made from either the community property or separate property of the decedent. Unless otherwise ordered by the court, the probate and nonprobate assets of the decedent abate in accordance with chapter 11.10 RCW in satisfaction of the award.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The award may be made whether or not probate proceedings have been commenced in the state of Washington. The court may not make this award unless the petition for the award is filed before the earliest of:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Eighteen months from the date of the decedent's death if within twelve months of the decedent's death either:</p>
<ol type="i">

<p>If it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the court with clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that a claimant's present and reasonably anticipated future needs during the pendency of any probate proceedings in the state of Washington with respect to basic maintenance and support will not otherwise be provided for from other resources, and that the award would not be inconsistent with the decedent's intentions, the amount of the award may be increased in an amount the court determines to be appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining the needs of the claimant, the court shall consider, without limitation, the resources available to the claimant and the claimant's dependents, and the resources reasonably expected to be available to the claimant and the claimant's dependents during the pendency of the probate, including income related to present or future employment and benefits flowing from the decedent's probate and nonprobate estate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining the intentions of the decedent, the court shall consider, without limitation:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Provisions made for the claimant by the decedent under the terms of the decedent's will or otherwise;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provisions made for third parties or other entities under the decedent's will or otherwise that would be affected by an increased award;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the claimant is the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner, the duration and status of the marriage or the state registered domestic partnership of the decedent to the claimant at the time of the decedent's death;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The effect of any award on the availability of any other resources or benefits to the claimant;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The size and nature of the decedent's estate; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oral or written statements made by the decedent that are otherwise admissible as evidence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The fact that the decedent has named beneficiaries other than the claimant as recipients of the decedent's estate is not of itself adequate to evidence such an intent as would prevent the award of an amount in excess of that provided for in *RCW 6.13.030(2) with respect to lands.</p>

<p>Subject to (a) of this subsection, a request for an increased award may be made at any time during the pendency of the probate proceedings.

<li>
<p>The court may decrease the amount of the award below the amount provided in RCW 11.54.020 in the exercise of its discretion if the recipient is entitled to receive probate or nonprobate property, including insurance, by reason of the death of the decedent. In such a case the award must be decreased by no more than the value of such other property as is received by reason of the death of the decedent. The court shall consider the factors presented in RCW 11.54.040(2) in determining the propriety of the award and the proper amount of the award, if any.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An award to a surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner is also discretionary and the amount otherwise allowable may be reduced if: (a) The decedent is survived by children who are not the children of the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner and the award would decrease amounts otherwise distributable to such children; or (b) the award would have the effect of reducing amounts otherwise distributable to any of the decedent's minor children. In either case the court shall consider the factors presented in RCW 11.54.040 (2) and (3) and whether the needs of the minor children with respect to basic maintenance and support are and will be adequately provided for, both during and after the pendency of any probate proceedings if such proceedings are pending, considering support from any source, including support from the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner.</p>
