<p>The leasing of motor vehicles, furniture and fixtures, appliances, commercial equipment, and other personal property has become an important and widespread form of business transaction that is beneficial to the citizens and to the economy of the state. Users of personal property of all types and lessors throughout the state have relied upon the distinct nature of leasing as a modern means of transacting business that creates different relationships and legal consequences from those of lender and borrower in loan transactions and those of seller and buyer in installment sale transactions. The utility of lease transactions and the well-being of the state's economy and of the leasing industry require that leasing be a legally recognized and distinct form of transaction, creating legal relationships and having legal consequences different from loans or installment sales.</p>

<p>As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The term &quot;adjusted capitalized cost&quot; means the agreed-upon amount that serves as the basis for determining the periodic lease payment, computed by subtracting from the gross capitalized cost any capitalized cost reduction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The term &quot;gross capitalized cost&quot; means the amount ascribed by the lessor to the vehicle including optional equipment, plus taxes, title, license fees, lease acquisition and administrative fees, insurance premiums, warranty charges, and any other product, service, or amount amortized in the lease. However, any definition of gross capitalized cost adopted by the federal reserve board to be used in the context of mandatory disclosure of the gross capitalized cost to lessees in consumer motor vehicle lease transactions supersedes the definition of gross capitalized cost in this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The term &quot;capitalized cost reduction&quot; means any payment made by cash, check, or similar means, any manufacturer rebate, and net trade in allowance granted by the lessor at the inception of the lease for the purpose of reducing the gross capitalized cost but does not include any periodic lease payments due at the inception of the lease or all of the periodic lease payments if they are paid at the inception of the lease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The term &quot;consumer lease&quot; means a contract of lease or bailment for the use of personal property by a natural person for a period of time exceeding four months, and for a total contractual obligation not exceeding twenty-five thousand dollars, primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, whether or not the lessee has the option to purchase or otherwise become the owner of the property at the expiration of the lease, except that such term shall not include any lease which meets the definition of a retail installment contract under RCW 63.14.010 or the definition of a lease-purchase agreement under chapter 63.19 RCW. The twenty-five thousand dollar total contractual obligation in this subsection shall not apply to consumer leases of motor vehicles. The inclusion in a lease of a provision whereby the lessee's or lessor's liability, at the end of the lease period or upon an earlier termination, is based on the value of the leased property at that time, shall not be deemed to make the transaction other than a consumer lease. The term &quot;consumer lease&quot; does not include a lease for agricultural, business, or commercial purposes, or to a government or governmental agency or instrumentality, or to an organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The term &quot;lessee&quot; means a natural person who leases or is offered a consumer lease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The term &quot;lessor&quot; means a person who is regularly engaged in leasing, offering to lease, or arranging to lease under a consumer lease.</p>
</li>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Where the lessee's liability on expiration of a consumer lease is based on the estimated residual value of the property, such estimated residual value shall be a reasonable approximation of the anticipated actual fair market value of the property on lease expiration. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the estimated residual value is unreasonable to the extent that the estimated residual value exceeds the actual residual value by more than three times the average payment allocable to a monthly period under the lease. In addition, where the lessee has such liability on expiration of a consumer lease there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the lessor's estimated residual value is not in good faith to the extent that the estimated residual value exceeds the actual residual value by more than three times the average payment allocable to a monthly period under the lease and such lessor shall not collect from the lessee the amount of such excess liability on expiration of a consumer lease unless the lessor brings a successful action with respect to such excess liability. In all actions, the lessor shall pay the lessee's reasonable attorneys' fees. The presumptions stated in this section shall not apply to the extent the excess of estimated over actual residual value is due to physical damage to the property beyond reasonable wear and use, or to excessive use, and the lease may set standards for such wear and use if such standards are not unreasonable. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the right of a willing lessee to make any mutually agreeable final adjustment with respect to such excess residual liability, provided such an agreement is reached after termination of the lease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Penalties or other charges for delinquency, default, or early termination may be specified in the lease but only at an amount which is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the delinquency, default, or early termination, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a lease has a residual value provision at the termination of the lease, the lessee may obtain, at his or her expense, a professional appraisal of the leased property by an independent third party agreed to be both parties. Such appraisal shall be final and binding on the parties.</p>

</li>
