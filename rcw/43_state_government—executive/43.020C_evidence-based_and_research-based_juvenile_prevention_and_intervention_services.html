<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends that prevention and intervention services delivered to children and juveniles in the areas of mental health, child welfare, and juvenile justice be primarily evidence-based and research-based, and it is anticipated that such services will be provided in a manner that is culturally competent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also acknowledges that baseline information is not presently available regarding the extent to which evidence-based and research-based practices are presently available and in use in the areas of children's mental health, child welfare, and juvenile justice; the cost of those practices; and the most effective strategies and appropriate time frames for expecting their broader use. Thus, it would be wise to establish baseline data regarding the use and availability of evidence-based and research-based practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that increased use of evidence-based and research-based practices be accomplished to the extent possible within existing resources by coordinating the purchase of evidence-based services, the development of a trained workforce, and the development of unified and coordinated case plans to provide treatment in a coordinated and consistent manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that in order to effectively provide evidence-based and research-based practices, contractors should have a workforce trained in these programs, and outcomes from the use of these practices should be monitored.</p>

<p>By September 30, 2012, the Washington state institute for public policy, the University of Washington evidence-based practice institute, in consultation with the department shall publish descriptive definitions of evidence-based, research-based, and promising practices in the areas of child welfare, juvenile rehabilitation, and children's mental health services.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>In addition to descriptive definitions, the Washington state institute for public policy and the University of Washington evidence-based practice institute must prepare an inventory of evidence-based, research-based, and promising practices for prevention and intervention services that will be used for the purpose of completing the baseline assessment described in subsection (2) of this section. The inventory shall be periodically updated as more practices are identified.</p>

<li>
<p>In identifying evidence-based and research-based services, the Washington state institute for public policy and the University of Washington evidence-based practice institute must:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Consider any available systemic evidence-based assessment of a program's efficacy and cost-effectiveness; and</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using state, federal, or private funds, the department shall prioritize the assessment of promising practices identified in (a) of this subsection with the goal of increasing the number of such practices that meet the standards for evidence-based and research-based practices.</p>

<li>
<p>By June 30, 2013, the department and the health care authority shall complete a baseline assessment of utilization of evidence-based and research-based practices in the areas of child welfare, juvenile rehabilitation, and children's mental health services.

<p>For children's mental health services, the number and percentage of encounters using these services that are provided to children served by behavioral health organizations and children receiving mental health services through medicaid fee-for-service or healthy options;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The relative availability of the service in the various regions of the state; and</p>

<p>By December 30, 2013, the department and the health care authority shall report to the governor and to the appropriate fiscal and policy committees of the legislature on recommended strategies, timelines, and costs for increasing the use of evidence-based and research-based practices. The report must distinguish between a reallocation of existing funding to support the recommended strategies and new funding needed to increase the use of the practices.</p>
