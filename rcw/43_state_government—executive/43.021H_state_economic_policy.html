<p>The purpose of this chapter is to assert that it is the intent of the legislature that economic values are given appropriate consideration along with environmental, social, health, and safety considerations in the promulgation of rules by state and local government.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that agency and local government decisions can have negative economic consequences for businesses, particularly small businesses, as well as for employees of those businesses. All state agencies and local government entities with rule-making authority under state law or local ordinance must adopt methods and procedures which will insure that economic impacts and values will be given appropriate consideration in the rule-making process along with environmental, social, health, and safety considerations.</p>
