<p>It is the intent of the legislature wherever possible to place the internal affairs of the department under the control of the director in order that the director may institute therein the flexible, alert, and intelligent management of its business that changing contemporary circumstances require. Therefore, whenever the director's authority is not specifically limited by law, the director has complete charge and supervisory powers over the department. The director may create such administrative structures as the director considers appropriate, except as otherwise specified by law. The director may employ such assistants and personnel as necessary for the general administration of the department. This employment shall be in accordance with the state civil service law, chapter 41.06 RCW, except as otherwise provided.</p>

<p>The director shall appoint a state physical anthropologist. At a minimum, the state physical anthropologist must have a doctorate in either archaeology or anthropology and have experience in forensic osteology or other relevant aspects of physical anthropology and must have at least one year of experience in laboratory reconstruction and analysis. A medical degree with archaeological experience in addition to the experience required may substitute for a doctorate in archaeology or anthropology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state physical anthropologist has the primary responsibility of investigating, preserving, and, when necessary, removing and reinterring discoveries of nonforensic skeletal human remains. The state physical anthropologist is available to any local governments or any federally recognized tribal government within the boundaries of Washington to assist in determining whether discovered skeletal human remains are forensic or nonforensic.</p>

<li>
<p>The director shall hire staff as necessary to support the state physical anthropologist to meet the objectives of this section.</p>

<p>The skeletal human remains assistance account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. All appropriations provided by the legislature for this purpose as well as any reimbursement for services provided pursuant to chapter 275, Laws of 2008 must be deposited in the account. Expenditures from the account may be used only for archaeological determinations and excavations of inadvertently discovered skeletal human remains, and removal and reinterment of such remains when necessary. Only the director or the director's designee may authorize expenditures from the account. The account is subject to the allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures.</p>
