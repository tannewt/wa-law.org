<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that current concern over the rapid and increasing loss of rural, agricultural, and forested land has led to the exploration of creative approaches to preserving these important lands, and that the creation of a regional transfer of development rights marketplace will assist in conserving these lands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A transfer of development rights is a market-based exchange mechanism that encourages the voluntary transfer of development rights from sending areas with lower population densities to receiving areas with higher population densities. When development rights are transferred through a transfer of development rights exchange, permanent deed restrictions are placed on the sending area properties to ensure that the land will be used only for approved activities, activities that may include farming, forest management, conservation, or passive recreation. Additionally, in a transfer of development rights exchange, the costs of purchasing the recorded development restrictions are borne by the developers who receive the transferred right in the form of a building credit or bonus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that a successful transfer of development rights program must consider housing affordable to all economic segments of the population, and economic development programs and policies in designated receiving areas. Counties, cities, and towns that decide to participate in the regional transfer of development rights program for central Puget Sound are encouraged to adopt comprehensive plan policies and development regulations to implement the program that do not compete or conflict with comprehensive plan policies and development regulations that require or encourage affordable housing. Participating cities and towns are also encouraged to use the development of receiving areas to maximize opportunities for economic development that supports the creation or retention of jobs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participation in a regional transfer of development rights program by counties, cities, and towns should be as simple as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accordingly, the legislature has determined that it is good public policy to build upon existing transfer of development rights programs, pilot projects, and private initiatives that foster effective use of transferred development rights through the creation of a market-based program that focuses on the central Puget Sound region. A regional transfer of development rights program in the central Puget Sound should be voluntary, incentive-driven, and separate, but compatible with existing local transfer of development rights programs.</p>

<p>Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the department shall fund a process to develop a regional transfer of development rights program that comports with chapter 36.70A RCW that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Encourages King, Kitsap, Pierce, and Snohomish counties, and the cities within these counties, to participate in the development and implementation of regional frameworks and mechanisms that make transfer of development rights programs viable and successful. The department shall encourage and embrace the efforts in any of these counties or cities to develop local transfer of development rights programs. In fulfilling the requirements of this chapter, the department shall work with the Puget Sound regional council and its growth management policy board to develop a process that satisfies the requirements of this chapter. In the development of a process to create a regional transfer of development rights program, the Puget Sound regional council and its growth management policy board shall develop policies to discourage, or prohibit if necessary, the transfer of development rights from a sending area that would negatively impact the future economic viability of the sending area. The department shall also work with an advisory committee to develop a regional transfer of development rights marketplace that includes, but is not limited to, supporting strategies for financing infrastructure and conservation. The department shall establish an advisory committee of nine stakeholders with representatives of the following interests:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Two qualified nongovernmental organizations with expertise in the transfer of development rights. At least one organization must have a statewide expertise in growth management planning and in the transfer of development rights and at least one organization must have a local perspective on market-based conservation strategies and transfer of development rights;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two representatives from real estate and development;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One representative with a county government perspective;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two representatives from cities of different sizes and geographic areas within the four-county region; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two representatives of the agricultural industry; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allows the department to utilize recommendations of the interested local governments, nongovernmental entities, and the Puget Sound regional council to develop recommendations and strategies for a regional transfer of development rights marketplace with supporting strategies for financing infrastructure and conservation that represents the consensus of the governmental and nongovernmental parties engaged in the process. However, if agreement between the parties cannot be reached, the department shall make recommendations to the legislature that seek to balance the needs and interests of the interested governmental and nongovernmental parties. The department may contract for expertise to accomplish any of the following tasks. Recommendations developed under this subsection must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Identify opportunities for cities, counties, and the state to achieve significant benefits through using transfer of development rights programs and the value in modifying criteria by which capital budget funds are allocated, including but not limited to, existing state grant programs to provide incentives for local governments to implement transfer of development rights programs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Address challenges to the creation of an efficient and transparent transfer of development rights market, including the creation of a transfer of development rights bank, brokerage, or direct buyer-seller exchange;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Address issues of certainty to buyers and sellers of development rights that address long-term environmental benefits and perceived inequities in land values and permitting processes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Address the means for assuring that appropriate values are recognized and updated, as well as specifically addressing the need to maintain the quality of life in receiving neighborhoods and the protection of environmental values over time;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify opportunities and challenges that, if resolved, would result in cities throughout the Puget Sound region participating in a transfer of development rights market;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare the uses of a regional transfer of development rights program to other existing land conservation strategies to protect rural and resource lands and implement the growth management act; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify appropriate sending areas so as to protect future growth and economic development needs of the sending areas.</p>

<p>Subject to the availability of funds appropriated for this specific purpose or another source of funding made available for this specific purpose, the department shall establish a regional transfer of development rights program in central Puget Sound, including King, Kitsap, Snohomish, and Pierce counties and the cities and towns within these counties. The program must be guided by the Puget Sound regional council's multicounty planning policies adopted under RCW 36.70A.210(7).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose of the program is to foster voluntary county, city, and town participation in the program so that interjurisdictional transfers occur between the counties, cities, and towns, including transfers from counties to cities and towns in other counties. Private transactions between buyers and sellers of transferable development rights are allowed and encouraged under this program. In fulfilling the requirements of this chapter, the department shall work with the Puget Sound regional council to implement a regional program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall encourage participation by the cities, towns, and counties in the regional program. The regional program shall not be implemented in a manner that negatively impacts existing local programs. The department shall encourage and work to enhance the efforts in any of these counties, cities, or towns to develop local transfer of development rights programs or enhance existing programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to the availability of funds appropriated for this specific purpose or another source of funding made available for this specific purpose, the department shall do the following to implement a regional transfer of development rights program in central Puget Sound:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Counties shall use the following criteria to guide the designation of sending areas for participation in the regional transfer of development rights program:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Land designated as agricultural or forestland of long-term commercial significance;</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>The designation of receiving areas is limited to incorporated cities or towns. Prior to designating a receiving area, a city or town should have adequate infrastructure planned and funding identified for development in the receiving area at densities or intensities consistent with what can be achieved under the local transfer of development rights program. Nothing in this subsection limits a city's, town's, or county's authority to designate additional lands for a receiving area under a local intrajurisdictional transfer of development rights program that is not part of the regional program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cities and towns participating in the regional transfer of development rights program shall have discretion to determine which sending areas they receive development rights from to be used in their designated receiving areas.</p>
