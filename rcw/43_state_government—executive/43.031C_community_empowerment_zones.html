<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>There are geographic areas within communities that are characterized by a lack of employment opportunities, an average income level that is below the median income level for the surrounding community, a lack of affordable housing, deteriorating infrastructure, and a lack of facilities for community services, job training, and education;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strategies to encourage reinvestment in these areas by assisting local businesses to become stronger and area residents to gain economic power involve a variety of activities and partnerships;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reinvestment in these areas cannot be accomplished with only governmental resources and require a comprehensive approach that integrates various incentives, programs, and initiatives to meet the economic, physical, and social needs of the area;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Successful reinvestment depends on a local government's ability to coordinate public resources in a cohesive, comprehensive strategy that is designed to leverage long-term private investment in an area;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reinvestment can strengthen the overall tax base through increased tax revenue from expanded and new business activities and physical property improvement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local governments, in cooperation with area residents, can provide leadership as well as planning and coordination of resources and necessary supportive services to address reinvestment in the area; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is in the public interest to adopt a targeted approach to revitalization and enlist the resources of all levels of government, the private sector, community-based organizations, and community residents to revitalize an area.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature declares that the purposes of the community empowerment zone act are to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Encourage reinvestment through strong partnerships and cooperation between all levels of government, community-based organizations, area residents, and the private sector;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Involve the private sector and stimulate private reinvestment through the judicious use of public resources;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Target governmental resources to those areas of greatest need; and</p>

<li>
<p>Include all levels of government, community individuals, organizations, and the private sector in the policy-making process.</p>
