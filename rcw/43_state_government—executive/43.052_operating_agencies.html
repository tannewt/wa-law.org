<p>For the purposes provided for in this chapter, an operating agency shall have power to issue revenue bonds or warrants payable from the revenues of the utility properties operated by it. Whenever the board of a joint operating agency shall deem it advisable to issue bonds or warrants to engage in conservation activities or to construct or acquire any public utility or any works, plants or facilities or any additions or betterments thereto or extensions thereof it shall provide therefor by resolution, which shall specify and adopt the system or plan proposed and declare the estimated cost thereof as near as may be. Such cost may include funds for working capital, for payment of expenses incurred in the conservation activities or the acquisition or construction of the utility and for the repayment of advances made to the operating agency by any public utility district or city. Except as otherwise provided in RCW 43.52.343, all the provisions of law as now or hereafter in effect relating to revenue bonds or warrants of public utility districts shall apply to revenue bonds or warrants issued by the joint operating agency including, without limitation, provisions relating to: The creation of special funds and the pledging of revenues thereto; the time and place of payment of such bonds or warrants and the interest rate or rates thereon; the covenants that may be contained therein and the effect thereof; the execution, issuance, sale, funding, or refunding, redemption and registration of such bonds or warrants; and the status thereof as negotiable instruments, as legal securities for deposits of public moneys and as legal investments for trustees and other fiduciaries and for savings and loan associations, banks and insurance companies doing business in this state. However, for revenue bonds or warrants issued by an operating agency, the provisions under RCW 54.24.030 relating to additional or alternate methods for payment may be made a part of the contract with the owners of any revenue bonds or warrants of an operating agency. The board may authorize the managing director or the treasurer of the operating agency to sell revenue bonds or warrants maturing one year or less from the date of issuance, and to fix the interest rate or rates on such revenue bonds or warrants with such restrictions as the board shall prescribe.

<p>Any two or more cities or public utility districts or combinations thereof may form an operating agency (herein sometimes called a joint operating agency) for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, operating and owning plants, systems and other facilities and extensions thereof, for the generation and/or transmission of electric energy and power. Each such agency shall be a municipal corporation of the state of Washington with the right to sue and be sued in its own name.</p>
<p>Application for the formation of an operating agency shall be made to the director of the department of ecology (herein sometimes referred to as the director) after the adoption of a resolution by the legislative body of each city or public utility district to be initial members thereof authorizing said city or district to participate. Such application shall set forth (1) the name and address of each participant, together with a certified copy of the resolution authorizing its participation; (2) a general description of the project and the principal project works, including dams, reservoirs, power houses and transmission lines; (3) the general location of the project and, if a hydroelectric project, the name of the stream on which such proposed project is to be located; (4) if the project is for the generation of electricity, the proposed use or market for the power to be developed; (5) a general statement of the electric loads and resources of each of the participants; (6) a statement of the proposed method of financing the preliminary engineering and other studies and the participation therein by each of the participants.</p>
<p>Within ten days after such application is filed with the director of the department of ecology notice thereof shall be published by the director once a week for four consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or counties in which such project is to be located, setting forth the names of the participants and the general nature, extent and location of the project. Any public utility wishing to do so may object to such application by filing an objection, setting forth the reasons therefor, with the director of the department of ecology not later than ten days after the date of last publication of such notice.</p>
<p>Within ninety days after the date of last publication the director shall either make findings thereon or have instituted a hearing thereon. In the event the director has neither made findings nor instituted a hearing within ninety days of the date of last publication, or if such hearing is instituted within such time but no findings are made within one hundred and twenty days of the date of such last publication, the application shall be deemed to have been approved and the operating agency established. If it shall appear (a) that the statements set forth in said application are substantially correct; (b) that the contemplated project is such as is adaptable to the needs, both actual and prospective, of the participants and such other public utilities as indicate a good faith intention by contract or by letter of intent to participate in the use of such project; (c) that no objection to the formation of such operating agency has been filed by any other public utility which prior to and at the time of the filing of the application for such operating agency had on file a permit or license from an agency of the state or an agency of the United States, whichever has primary jurisdiction, for the construction of such project; (d) that adequate provision will be made for financing the preliminary engineering, legal and other costs necessary thereto; the director shall make findings to that effect and enter an order creating such operating agency, establishing the name thereof and the specific project for the construction and operation for which such operating agency is formed. Such order shall not be construed to constitute a bar to any other public utility proceeding according to law to procure any required governmental permits, licenses or authority, but such order shall establish the competency of the operating agency to proceed according to law to procure such permits, licenses or authority.</p>
<p>No operating agency shall undertake projects or conservation activities in addition to those for which it was formed without the approval of the legislative bodies of a majority of the members thereof. Prior to undertaking any new project for acquisition of an energy resource, a joint operating agency shall prepare a plan which details a least-cost approach for investment in energy resources. The plan shall include an analysis of the costs of developing conservation compared with costs of developing other energy resources and a strategy for implementation of the plan. The plan shall be presented to the energy and utilities committees of the senate and house of representatives for their review and comment. In the event that an operating agency desires to undertake such a hydroelectric project at a site or sites upon which any publicly or privately owned public utility has a license or permit or has a prior application for a license or permit pending with any commission or agency, state or federal, having jurisdiction thereof, application to construct such additional project shall be made to the director of the department of ecology in the same manner, subject to the same requirements and with the same notice as required for an initial agency and project and shall not be constructed until an order authorizing the same shall have been made by the director in the manner provided for such original application.</p>
<p>Any party who has joined in filing the application for, or objections against, the creation of such operating agency and/or the construction of an additional project, and who feels aggrieved by any order or finding of the director shall have the right to appeal to the superior court in the manner set forth in RCW 43.52.430.</p>
<p>After the formation of an operating agency, any other city or district may become a member thereof upon application to such agency after the adoption of a resolution of its legislative body authorizing said city or district to participate, and with the consent of the operating agency by the affirmative vote of the majority of its members. Any member may withdraw from an operating agency, and thereupon such member shall forfeit any and all rights or interest which it may have in such operating agency or in any of the assets thereof: PROVIDED, That all contractual obligations incurred while a member shall remain in full force and effect. An operating agency may be dissolved by the unanimous agreement of the members, and the members, after making provisions for the payment of all debts and obligations, shall thereupon hold the assets thereof as tenants in common.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Five members of the executive board shall be elected to four-year terms by the board of directors from among the members of the board of directors. The board of directors may provide by rule for the composition of the five members of the executive board elected from among the members of the board of directors so as to reflect the member public utility districts' and cities' participation in the joint operating agency's projects. Members elected to the executive board from the board of directors are ineligible for continued membership on the executive board if they cease to be members of the board of directors.

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The governor may remove outside directors from the executive board for incompetency, misconduct, or malfeasance in office in the same manner as state appointive officers under chapter 43.06 RCW. For purposes of this subsection, misconduct shall include, but not be limited to, nonfeasance and misfeasance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to mean that an operating agency is in any manner an agency of the state. Nothing in this chapter alters or destroys the status of an operating agency as a separate municipal corporation or makes the state liable in any way or to any extent for any preexisting or future debt of the operating agency or any present or future claim against the agency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The eleven members of the executive board shall be selected with the objective of establishing an executive board which has the resources to effectively carry out its responsibilities.

</li>
<li>
<p>The executive board shall select and employ a managing director of the operating agency and may delegate to the managing director such authority for the management and control of the operating agency as the executive board deems appropriate.

<li>
<p>Members of the executive board shall be immune from civil liability for mistakes and errors of judgment in the good faith performance of acts within the scope of their official duties involving the exercise of judgment and discretion.

<p>The board of each joint operating agency shall by resolution appoint a treasurer. The treasurer shall be the chief financial officer of the operating agency, who shall report at least annually to the board a detailed statement of the financial condition of the operating agency and of its financial operations for the preceding fiscal year. The treasurer shall advise the board on all matters affecting the financial condition of the operating agency.
