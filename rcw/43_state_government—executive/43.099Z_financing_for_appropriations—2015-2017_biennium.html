Bonds authorized in this section may be sold at such price as the state finance committee shall determine.

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Two billion one hundred eighty-five million five hundred sixty-two thousand dollars to remain in the state building construction account created by RCW 43.83.020;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One hundred twenty-three million eight hundred thousand dollars to the state taxable building construction account. All receipts from taxable bonds issued are to be deposited into the account. If the state finance committee deems it necessary or advantageous to issue more than the amount specified in this subsection (1)(b) as taxable bonds in order to comply with federal internal revenue service rules and regulations pertaining to the use of nontaxable bond proceeds or in order to reduce the total financing costs for bonds issued, the proceeds of such additional taxable bonds shall be transferred to the state taxable building construction account in lieu of any transfer otherwise provided by this section. If the state finance committee determines that a portion of the amount specified in this subsection (1)(b) as taxable bonds may be issued as nontaxable bonds in compliance with federal internal revenue service rules and regulations pertaining to the use of nontaxable bond proceeds, then such bond proceeds shall be transferred to the state building construction account in lieu of the transfer to the state taxable building construction account otherwise provided by this subsection (1)(b). The state treasurer shall submit written notice to the director of financial management if it is determined that any such additional transfer to the state taxable building construction account is necessary or that a transfer from the state taxable building construction account to the state building construction account may be made. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The treasurer shall transfer bond proceeds deposited in the state building construction account into the outdoor recreation account created by RCW 79A.25.060, the habitat conservation account created by RCW 79A.15.020, the riparian protection account created by RCW 79A.15.120, and the farmlands preservation account created by *RCW 79A.15.130 at various times and in various amounts necessary to support authorized expenditures from those accounts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>These proceeds shall be used exclusively for the purposes specified in this section and for the payment of expenses incurred in the issuance and sale of the bonds issued for the purposes of this section, and shall be administered by the office of financial management subject to legislative appropriation.</p>
