A youth court agreement shall be reduced to writing and signed by the court and the youth accepting the terms of the agreement. Such agreements shall be entered into as expeditiously as possible.</p>

<p>Youth courts may require that the youth pay any costs associated with conditions imposed upon the youth by the youth court.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A youth court disposition shall be completed within one hundred eighty days from the date of referral.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court, as specified in RCW 3.72.010, shall monitor the successful or unsuccessful completion of the disposition.</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A youth court agreement may extend beyond the eighteenth birthday of the youth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any juvenile who is, or may be, referred to a youth court shall be afforded due process in all contacts with the youth court regardless of whether the juvenile is accepted by the youth court or whether the youth court program is successfully completed. Such due process shall include, but not be limited to, the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A written agreement shall be executed stating all conditions in clearly understandable language and the action that will be taken by the court upon successful or unsuccessful completion of the agreement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Violation of the terms of the agreement shall be the only grounds for termination.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>
</li>

<p>A court may refuse to enter into a youth court agreement with a juvenile. When a court refuses to enter a youth court agreement with a juvenile, it shall set the matter for hearing in accordance with all applicable court rules and statutory provisions governing the hearing and disposition of traffic infractions, transit infractions, and civil infractions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a monetary penalty required by a youth court agreement cannot reasonably be paid due to a lack of financial resources of the youth, the court may convert any or all of the monetary penalty into community service. The modification of the youth court agreement shall be in writing and signed by the juvenile and the court. The number of hours of community service in lieu of a monetary penalty shall be converted at the rate of the prevailing state minimum wage per hour.</p>

<p>Youth courts provide a disposition method for cases involving juveniles alleged to have committed traffic or transit infractions. Youth courts may also provide diversion in cases involving juvenile offenders who are eligible for diversion pursuant to RCW 13.40.070 (6) and (8) and who agree, along with a parent, guardian, or legal custodian, to comply with the provisions of RCW 13.40.600.

Youth court participants, under the supervision of the court or an adult coordinator, may serve in various capacities within the youth court, acting in the role of jurors, lawyers, bailiffs, clerks, and judges. Youth courts and student courts have no jurisdiction except as provided for in this chapter, chapter 13.40 RCW, and RCW 28A.300.420.
