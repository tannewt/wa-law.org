<li>
<p>For a proposal to dissolve to be approved:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The board of directors must recommend dissolution to the shareholders unless (i) the board of directors determines that because of conflict of interest or other special circumstances it should make no recommendation or (ii) RCW 23B.08.245 applies, and in either case the board of directors communicates the basis for so proceeding to the shareholders; and</p>

<li>
<p>The corporation shall notify each shareholder, whether or not entitled to vote, of the proposed dissolution either (a) by giving notice of a shareholders' meeting in accordance with RCW 23B.07.050 and stating that the purpose or one of the purposes of the meeting is to consider dissolving the corporation, or (b) in accordance with the requirements of RCW 23B.07.040 for approving the proposed dissolution without a meeting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to any other voting conditions imposed by the board of directors under subsection (3) of this section, the proposed dissolution must be approved by two-thirds of the voting group comprising all the votes entitled to be cast on the proposed dissolution, and of each other voting group entitled under the articles of incorporation to vote separately on the proposed dissolution. The articles of incorporation may require a greater or lesser vote than provided in this subsection, or a greater or lesser vote by any separate voting groups provided for in the articles of incorporation, so long as the required vote is not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the proposed dissolution and of each other voting group entitled to vote separately on the proposed dissolution.</p>

<p>A dissolved corporation shall, within thirty days after the effective date of its articles of dissolution, publish notice of its dissolution and request that persons with claims against the dissolved corporation present them in accordance with the notice. The notice must be published once a week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the dissolved corporation's principal office (or, if none in this state, its registered office) is or was last located. The notice must also describe the information that must be included in a claim, provide a mailing address where a claim may be sent, and state that claims against the dissolved corporation may be barred in accordance with the provisions of this chapter if not timely asserted.

<p>A dissolved corporation continues its corporate existence but may not carry on any business except that appropriate to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs, including:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Collecting its assets;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disposing of its properties that will be applied toward satisfaction or making reasonable provision for satisfaction of its liabilities or will otherwise not be distributed in kind to its shareholders, but in any case subject to applicable liens and security interests as well as any applicable contractual restrictions on the disposition of its properties;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Satisfying or making reasonable provision for satisfying its liabilities, in accordance with their priorities as established by law, and on a pro rata basis within each class of liabilities;</p>

<li>
<p>Doing every other act necessary to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs.</p>

<li>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, dissolution of a corporation does not:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Transfer title to the corporation's property;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prevent transfer of its shares or securities, although the authorization to dissolve may provide for closing the corporation's share transfer records;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject its directors or officers to standards of conduct different from those prescribed in chapter 23B.08 RCW;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change quorum or voting requirements for its board of directors or shareholders; change provisions for selection, resignation, or removal of its directors or officers or both; or change provisions for amending its bylaws;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prevent commencement of a proceeding by or against the corporation in its corporate name;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abate or suspend a proceeding pending by or against the corporation on the effective date of dissolution; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terminate the authority of the registered agent of the corporation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A dissolved corporation's board of directors may make a determination that reasonable provision for the satisfaction of any liability, whether arising in tort or by contract, statute, or otherwise, and whether matured or unmatured, contingent, or conditional, has been made by means of a purchase of insurance coverage, provision of security therefor, contractual assumption thereof by a solvent person, or any other means, that the board of directors determines is reasonably calculated to provide for satisfaction of the reasonably estimated amount of such liability. Upon making such a determination, the board of directors shall, for purposes of determining whether a subsequent distribution to shareholders is prohibited under RCW 23B.06.400(2), be entitled to treat such liability as fully satisfied by the assets used or committed in order to make such provision. In making determinations under RCW 23B.06.400(2), the board of directors of a dissolved corporation may also disregard, and make no provision for the satisfaction of, any liabilities that are barred in accordance with RCW 23B.14.060(2), or that may exceed any provision for their satisfaction ordered by a superior court pursuant to RCW 23B.14.065, or that the board of directors does not consider, based on the facts known to it, reasonably likely to arise prior to expiration of the survival period specified in RCW 23B.14.340.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board of directors of a dissolved corporation may at any time petition to have the dissolution continued under court supervision in accordance with RCW 23B.14.300, or, upon a finding that the corporation is not able to pay its liabilities as they become due in the usual course of business or that its assets are less than the sum of its total liabilities, may dedicate the corporation's assets to the repayment of its creditors by making an assignment for the benefit of creditors in accordance with chapter 7.08 RCW or obtaining the appointment of a general receiver in accordance with chapter 7.60 RCW. The assumption of control over the corporation's assets by a court, an assignee for the benefit of creditors, or a general receiver relieves the directors of any further duties with respect to the liquidation of the corporation's assets or the application of any assets or proceeds toward satisfaction of its liabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Corporate actions to be approved by a corporation that has been dissolved under RCW 23B.14.030 or * 23B.14.210, which are within the scope of activities permitted in this chapter, may be approved by the corporation's board of directors and, if required, by its shareholders, membership in both groups determined as of the effective date of the dissolution. If vacancies in the board of directors occur after the effective date of dissolution, the shareholders, or the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum of the board, may fill the vacancies. A special meeting of the shareholders for purposes of approving any corporate action required or permitted to be approved by shareholders, or for purposes of electing directors, may be called by any person who was an officer, director, or shareholder of the corporation at the effective date of the dissolution.</p>

If the undistributed assets of the corporation are not or may not be sufficient to satisfy the amount of the unpaid claim, and there have been distributions to shareholders as to which the limitations period specified in RCW 23B.08.310(5) has not expired at the time the proceeding is commenced, the holder of the unpaid claim may include as a part of the relief claimed against the dissolved corporation a petition to compel the dissolved corporation to collect any amounts owing to it by directors or shareholders under RCW 23B.08.310 and to apply the collections toward payment of the claim. The filing of such a petition to compel the corporation to collect unlawfully distributed amounts from directors or shareholders tolls the limitations periods specified in RCW 23B.08.310(5) and 23B.14.340 with respect to the unpaid claim, as to directors and shareholders who may be liable under RCW 23B.08.310. If the dissolved corporation fails, within a reasonable period of time after the filing of such a petition to compel it to collect amounts owing under RCW 23B.08.310, to join those directors and shareholders who may be liable for the amounts, the holder of the unpaid claim may join those directors and shareholders as additional defendants in the proceeding. The holder of the unpaid claim may also join all directors and shareholders who may be liable under RCW 23B.08.310 as additional defendants in the proceeding, at any time upon establishing to the satisfaction of the court that any of such shareholders, with intent to delay or defraud or place property beyond the reach of the corporation's creditors, has removed or is about to remove from this state, or has assigned, secreted, or disposed of, or is about to assign, secrete, or dispose of, any of the property distributed by the corporation as to which the shareholder may be liable under RCW 23B.08.310(3). Except as permitted by this section, the holder of the unpaid claim may not, by means of any proceeding or otherwise, seek to enforce the claim directly against any of the dissolved corporation's officers or directors in those capacities, or against any of its shareholders on account of their receipt of distributions after the effective date of dissolution.</p>
