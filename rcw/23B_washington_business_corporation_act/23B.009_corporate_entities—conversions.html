<p>In the case of an entity conversion of a domestic corporation to an other entity:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The plan of entity conversion must be adopted by the board of directors of the converting entity and the shareholders entitled to vote must approve the plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After adopting a plan of entity conversion, the board of directors of the converting entity must submit the plan of entity conversion for approval by its shareholders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board of directors must recommend the plan of entity conversion to the shareholders, unless (a) the board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation; or (b) RCW 23B.08.245 applies, and in either case the board of directors communicates the basis for so proceeding to the shareholders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board of directors may condition its submission of the plan of entity conversion on any basis, including the affirmative vote of holders of a specified percentage of shares held by any group of shareholders not otherwise entitled to vote as a separate voting group on the plan of entity conversion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of an entity conversion of a domestic corporation to a foreign corporation, in addition to any other voting conditions imposed by the board of directors acting pursuant to subsection (4) of this section, approval of the plan of entity conversion requires the affirmative vote of shareholders that would be required to approve a plan of merger under RCW 23B.11.030, and of each other voting group entitled under RCW 23B.11.035 or the articles of incorporation to vote separately on a plan of merger. Separate voting by additional voting groups is required on a plan of entity conversion if such voting group or groups would be entitled to vote on a plan of merger under the circumstances described in RCW 23B.11.035. The articles of incorporation may require a greater or lesser vote to approve a plan of entity conversion than that provided in this subsection, or a greater or lesser vote by separate voting groups, so long as the required vote is not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the plan of entity conversion and of each other voting group entitled to vote separately on the plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of an entity conversion of a domestic corporation to an other entity that is not a foreign corporation, approval of the plan of entity conversion requires the approval of all shareholders of the domestic corporation, whether or not entitled to vote under this title or the articles of incorporation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If as a result of the conversion one or more shareholders of the domestic corporation would become subject to owner liability for the debts, obligations, or liabilities of any other person or entity, in addition to the approval requirements under subsections (5) and (6) of this section, approval of the plan of entity conversion must also require each such shareholder to execute a separate written consent to become subject to such owner liability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the approval of the shareholders is to be given at a meeting, the domestic corporation must notify each shareholder, whether or not entitled to vote, of the proposed meeting of shareholders at which the plan of entity conversion is to be submitted for approval in accordance with RCW 23B.07.050. The notice must state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the plan of entity conversion and must contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the plan of entity conversion. The notice must include or be accompanied by a copy of the organic documents of the surviving entity as they will be in effect immediately after the conversion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any provision of the articles of incorporation, bylaws, or an agreement to which any of the directors or shareholders of the domestic corporation are parties, adopted, or entered into before June 12, 2014, applies to a merger of the domestic corporation, other than a provision that limits or eliminates voting or dissenters' rights, and the document does not refer to an entity conversion of the domestic corporation, the provision is deemed to apply to an entity conversion of the domestic corporation until the provision is subsequently amended.</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The articles of entity conversion take effect at the effective time provided in RCW 23.95.210. Articles of entity conversion under subsection (1) or (2) of this section may be combined with any required conversion filing under the organic law of the other entity if the combined filing satisfies the requirements of both this section and the organic law of the other entity.</p>
