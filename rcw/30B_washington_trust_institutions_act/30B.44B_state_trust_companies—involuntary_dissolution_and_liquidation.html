<p>After the expiration of thirty days from the director's written notice to correct an unsafe condition of the state trust company, the director may take possession of the business and property of a state trust company to which this title is applicable whenever it appears that the state trust company:</p>
<ol type="a">

</li>
<li>
<p>Is conducting its business in an unauthorized or unsafe manner;</p>

<li>
<p>Through its officers, has refused to be examined upon oath regarding its affairs; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has made a voluntary assignment of its assets to trustees.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the notice requirement in subsection (1) of this section, the director may without notice seize and take immediate possession of a state trust company if it appears to the director that the conditions of the state trust company are so hazardous that they pose an imminent threat to the general public or the interests of the state trust company's clients.</p>

<p>If the director consents, any state trust company may voluntarily place its assets and business under the control of the director for liquidation by a resolution of a majority of its directors or members upon notice to the director. Upon taking possession of the state trust company, the director, or duly appointed agent, shall retain possession thereof until the state trust company is authorized by the director to resume business or until the affairs of the state trust company are fully liquidated as provided in this chapter. A state trust company shall not make any general assignment for the benefit of its creditors except by surrendering possession of its assets to the director, as provided in this section. Whenever any state trust company for any reason suspends operations for any length of time, the state trust company shall, immediately upon such suspension of operations, be deemed in the possession of the director and subject to liquidation under this chapter.</p>

<p>The taking of possession of any state trust company by the director pursuant to RCW 30B.44B.005 or 30B.44B.010 is sufficient to place all of the state trust company's fiduciary assets in the custody of the director and all of the nonfiduciary assets and property of every nature in the director's possession and bar all attachment proceedings.</p>

If, however, the court finds that no cause existed for taking possession of the state trust company, the court shall require the director to restore the state trust company to possession of its assets and enjoin the director from further interference with the state trust company without cause.</p>

The director shall deliver to each purchaser or lender an appropriate deed, mortgage, agreement of pledge, or other instrument of title or security. If real estate is situated outside of the county where the headquarters of the state trust company was located, a certified copy of the orders authorizing and confirming the sale or mortgage shall be filed for record in the county in which such property is situated.</p>
