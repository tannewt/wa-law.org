<li>
<p>To form a cemetery district, a petition designating the boundaries of the proposed district by metes and bounds or describing the lands to be included in the proposed district by government townships, ranges, and legal subdivisions, setting forth the object of the formation of the proposed district, and stating that the formation of the proposed district will be conducive to the public welfare and convenience, must be filed with the county auditor of the county in which the proposed district is located, accompanied by an obligation signed by two or more petitioners agreeing to pay the cost of publishing the notice specified in RCW 68.52.120.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The petition must be signed by at least ten percent of the registered voters in the proposed district. However, in counties with only one municipality the petition must be signed by at least ten percent of the registered voters in the proposed district, based on the total vote cast in the most recent county general election.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county auditor must, within thirty days from the date of filing of the petition, examine the signatures and certify the sufficiency or insufficiency of the petition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding subsection (3) of this section, in counties with only one municipality the county auditor must examine the signatures and certify the sufficiency or insufficiency of the petition within fifteen days from the date of filing of the petition. If the county auditor certifies that the petition is insufficient, the county auditor must afford the person who filed the petition ten days from that certification to add additional signatures to the petition. The petition must be refiled by the end of that period. Within fifteen days from the date of refiling, the county auditor must examine the signatures and certify the sufficiency or insufficiency of the petition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The name of any person who signed a petition may not be withdrawn from the petition after it has been filed with the county auditor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the petition is found to contain a sufficient number of valid signatures, the county auditor must transmit it, with a certificate of sufficiency attached, to the county legislative authority, which must thereupon, by resolution entered upon its minutes, receive the petition and fix a day and hour when it will publicly hear the petition.</p>

<p>After conducting the hearing on the petition, if the county legislative authority determines that the formation of the proposed cemetery district will be conducive to the public welfare and convenience, the county legislative authority must by resolution so declare, otherwise the county legislative authority must deny the petition.</p>

<p>Any commissioner may waive all or any portion of his or her compensation payable under this section as to any month or months during his or her term of office, by a written waiver filed with the clerk of the board. The waiver, to be effective, must be filed any time after the commissioner's election and prior to the date on which the compensation would otherwise be paid.

<li>
<p>The initial cemetery district commissioners must assume office immediately upon their election and qualification. Staggering of terms of office must be accomplished as follows: (a) The person elected receiving the greatest number of votes is elected to a six-year term of office if the election is held in an odd-numbered year or a five-year term of office if the election is held in an even-numbered year; (b) the person who is elected receiving the next greatest number of votes is elected to a four-year term of office if the election is held in an odd-numbered year or a three-year term of office if the election is held in an even-numbered year; and (c) the other person who is elected is elected to a two-year term of office if the election is held in an odd-numbered year or a one-year term of office if the election is held in an even-numbered year. The initial commissioners must assume office immediately after they are elected and qualified but their terms of office must be calculated from the first day of January after the election.</p>

If the bureau of labor and statistics develops more than one consumer price index for areas within the state, the index covering the greatest number of people, covering areas exclusively within the boundaries of the state, and including all items must be used for the adjustments for inflation in this section. The office of financial management must calculate the new dollar threshold and transmit it to the office of the code reviser for publication in the Washington State Register at least one month before the new dollar threshold is to take effect.</p>
