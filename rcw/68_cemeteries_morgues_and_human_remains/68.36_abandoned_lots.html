<p>The ownership or right to unoccupied cemetery space in this state shall, upon abandonment, be subject to forfeiture and sale by the person or entity having ownership or management of the cemetery.

<p>Cemetery management shall place a suitable notice on each unoccupied space, setting forth the date the notice is placed and that the unoccupied space is subject to forfeiture and sale by the cemetery. If the owner of the unoccupied space fails during the next three years following the date of the notice to maintain or care for the unoccupied space, the cemetery may reclaim the unoccupied space. However, such a notice cannot be placed on the unoccupied space in any cemetery lot until twenty years have elapsed since the last interment in any such lot of a member of the immediate family of the record owner.</p>

<p>After a three-year period, the owner or manager of the cemetery may file a verified petition in the office of the county clerk, setting forth the facts relating to the abandonment. The petition may ask for an order of the superior court for abandonment.</p>
<p>At the time of filing the petition, the cemetery authority shall request a hearing of the petition. The superior court will fix the time for the hearing. Not less than sixty days before the time fixed for the hearing of the petition, notice and nature of the hearing shall be given to the owner of such unoccupied space.</p>

<p>The notice may be served personally upon the owner, or may be given by the mailing of the notice by registered mail to the owner to his or her last known address and by publishing the notice three times in a legal newspaper published in the county in which the cemetery is located. In the event that the whereabouts of the owner is unknown, then the notice may be given by publishing the notice three times in a legal newspaper as required by this section. The cemetery authority may file an affidavit in the proceeding to the effect that the owner is unknown and that the cemetery exercised diligence in attempting to locate the unknown parties. The affidavit shall be conclusive to that effect.</p>

<p>An owner or claimant may appear and answer the allegations of the petition. If an owner fails to do so prior to the day fixed for hearing, a default shall be entered and it shall then be the duty of the superior court to immediately enter an order adjudging the unoccupied space to have been abandoned and subject to sale. In the event the owner or claimant shall appear and file his or her answer prior to the day fixed for the hearing, the presumption of abandonment shall no longer exist, and on the day fixed for the hearing of the petition or on any subsequent day to which the hearing of the cause is adjourned, the allegations and proof of the parties shall be presented to the court and if the court shall determine that there has been a continued failure to maintain or care for the unoccupied space for a period of three consecutive years preceding the filing of the petition, an order shall be entered accordingly adjudging the unoccupied space to have been abandoned and subject to sale at the expiration of one year by the person, association, corporation, or municipality having ownership of the cemetery containing the same. Upon any adjudication of abandonment, the court shall fix such sum as it shall deem reasonable as attorneys' fees for petitioner's attorney for rights of interment adjudged to have been abandoned in such proceedings.</p>
