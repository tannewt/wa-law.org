</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>A capital grant award may not exceed fifty thousand dollars, adjusted biennially for inflation. The department may not require applicants to provide matching funds.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

When evaluating and prioritizing projects, the committee shall consider the following criteria:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the proposed project will result in lower costs of maintenance and operations; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The relative percentage of military burials in the cemetery.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The conditions in this subsection must be met by recipients of funding in order to satisfy the public benefit requirements of the historic cemetery preservation capital grant program.</p>
<ol type="a">

<p>The committee shall provide the department a prioritized list of projects for funding. The department and grant recipient must execute a contract before work on the grant project begins. The contract must specify public benefit and minimum maintenance requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Public access to the exterior of properties that are not visible from a public right-of-way must be provided under reasonable terms and circumstances, including the requirement that visits by nonprofit organizations or school groups must be offered at least one day per year.

</ol>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>If a recipient of an historic cemetery preservation capital grant, or subsequent owner of a property that was assisted by a grant, takes any action within ten years of the award with respect to the assisted property such as dismantlement, removal, substantial alteration, or any other action inconsistent with the property's status as a cemetery, the grant must be repaid in full within one year.</p>
