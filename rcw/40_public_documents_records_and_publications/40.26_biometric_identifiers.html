<p>The legislature finds that the collection and use of personal information has been a practice of virtually all state agencies and programs. Advances in technology have given rise to new forms of data, such as email and internet protocol (IP) addresses, which can be easily collected and stored along with traditional types of data such as names and dates of birth. One new form of personally identifiable information is biometric identifiers. The unique nature of this new type of personal data calls for additional guidance regarding its use by state agencies.</p>

<p>Unless authorized by law, an agency may not collect, capture, purchase, or otherwise obtain a biometric identifier without first providing notice and obtaining the individual's consent, as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The notice provided must clearly specify the purpose and use of the biometric identifier; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The consent obtained must be specific to the terms of the notice, and must be recorded and maintained by the agency for the duration of the retention of the biometric identifier.</p>

<p>Any biometric identifier obtained by an agency:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>May not be sold;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise minimize the review and retention of the biometric identifiers, consistent with state record retention requirements; and</p>
