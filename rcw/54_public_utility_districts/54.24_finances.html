<p>The treasurer of the county in which a utility district is located shall be ex officio treasurer of the district: PROVIDED, That the commission by resolution may designate some other person having experience in financial or fiscal matters as treasurer of the utility district. The commission may require a bond, with a surety company authorized to do business in the state of Washington, in an amount and under the terms and conditions which the commission by resolution from time to time finds will protect the district against loss. The premium on any such bond shall be paid by the district.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All district funds shall be paid to the treasurer and shall be disbursed by him or her only on warrants issued by an auditor appointed by the commission, upon orders or vouchers approved by it. The treasurer shall establish a public utility district fund, into which shall be paid all district funds, and he or she shall maintain such special funds as may be created by the commission, into which he or she shall place all money as the commission may, by resolution, direct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the treasurer of the district is the treasurer of the county all district funds shall be deposited with the county depositaries under the same restrictions, contracts, and security as provided for county depositaries; if the treasurer of the district is some other person, all funds shall be deposited in such bank or banks authorized to do business in this state as the commission by resolution shall designate, and with surety bond to the district or securities in lieu thereof of the kind, no less in amount, as provided in *RCW 36.48.020 for deposit of county funds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such surety bond or securities in lieu thereof shall be filed or deposited with the treasurer of the district, and approved by resolution of the commission.</p>

<li>
<p>A district may provide and require a reasonable bond of any other person handling moneys or securities of the district: PROVIDED, That the district pays the premium thereon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the treasurer of the district is some other person than the treasurer of the county, the commission may adopt a policy for the payment of claims or other obligations of the utility district, which are payable out of solvent funds, and may elect to pay such obligations by check or warrant. However, if the applicable fund is not solvent at the time payment is ordered, then no check may be issued and payment shall be by warrant. When checks are to be used, the commission shall designate the qualified public depositary upon which the checks are to be drawn as well as the officers required or authorized to sign the checks. For the purposes of this chapter, &quot;warrant&quot; includes checks where authorized by this subsection.</p>

<li>Whenever the commission shall deem it advisable that the public utility district purchase, purchase and condemn, acquire, or construct any such public utility, or make any additions or betterments thereto, or extensions thereof, the commission shall provide therefor by resolution, which shall specify and adopt the system or plan proposed, and declare the estimated cost thereof, as near as may be, and specify whether general or utility indebtedness is to be incurred, the amount of such indebtedness, the amount of interest and the time in which all general bonds (if any) shall be paid, not to exceed thirty years. In the event the proposed general indebtedness to be incurred will bring the nonvoter approved indebtedness of the public utility district to an amount exceeding three-fourths of one percent of the value of the taxable property of the public utility district, as the term &quot;value of the taxable property&quot; is defined in RCW 39.36.015, the proposition of incurring such indebtedness and the proposed plan or system shall be submitted to the qualified electors of said public utility district for their approval or rejection at the next general election held in such public utility district. Elections shall be held as provided in RCW 39.36.050.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever the commission (or a majority of the qualified voters of such public utility district, voting at said election, when it is necessary to submit the same to said voters) shall have adopted a system or plan for any such public utility, as aforesaid, and shall have authorized indebtedness therefor by a three-fifths vote of the qualified voters of such district, voting at said election, general or public utility bonds may be used as hereinafter provided. The principal and interest of such general bonds shall be paid from the revenue of such public utility district after deducting costs of maintenance, operation, and expenses of the public utility district, and any deficit in the payment of principal and interest of said general bonds shall be paid by levying each year a tax upon the taxable property within said district sufficient to pay said interest and principal of said bonds, which tax shall be due and collectible as any other tax. Said bonds shall be issued and sold in accordance with chapter 39.46 RCW.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>All bonds and warrants issued under the authority of this chapter shall be legal securities, which may be used by any bank or trust company for deposit with the state treasurer, or any county or city treasurer, as security for deposits, in lieu of a surety bond, under any law relating to deposits of public moneys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the commission shall not desire to incur a general indebtedness in the purchase, condemnation and purchase, acquisition, or construction of any such public utility, or addition or betterment thereto, or extension thereof, it shall have the power to create a special fund or funds for the sole purpose of defraying the cost of such public utility, or addition or betterment thereto, or extension thereof, into which special fund or funds it may obligate and bind the district to set aside and pay a fixed proportion of the gross revenues of such public utility, or any fixed amount out of, and not exceeding a fixed proportion of, such revenues, or a fixed amount without regard to any fixed proportion, and to issue and sell revenue bonds or warrants bearing interest at such rate or rates, payable semiannually, executed in such manner, and payable at such times and places as the commission shall determine, but such bonds or warrants and the interest thereon, shall be payable only out of such special fund or funds. In creating any such special fund or funds, the commission shall have due regard to the cost of operation and maintenance of the plant or system as constructed or added to, and to any proportion or part of the revenues previously pledged as a fund for the payment of bonds or warrants, and shall not set aside into such special fund or funds a greater amount or proportion of the revenues and proceeds than, in its judgment, will be available over and above such cost of maintenance and operation and the amount or proportion, if any, of the revenues so previously pledged. Any such bonds or warrants, and interest thereon, issued against any such fund, as herein provided, shall be a valid claim of the owner thereof only as against the said special fund and its fixed proportion or amount of the revenue pledged to such fund, and shall not constitute an indebtedness of such district within the meaning of the constitutional provisions and limitations. Each such bond or warrant shall state on its face that it is payable from a special fund, naming such fund and the resolution creating it. Said bonds and warrants shall be sold in such manner as the commission shall deem for the best interests of the district. The commission may provide in any contract for the construction and acquisition of a proposed improvement or utility that payment therefor shall be made only in such bonds or warrants at the par value thereof. In all other respects, the issuance of such utility bonds or warrants and payment therefor shall be governed by the public utility laws for cities and towns. The revenue or utility bonds or warrants may be in any form, including bearer bonds or bearer warrants, or registered bonds or registered warrants as provided in RCW 39.46.030.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding subsection (3) of this section, any of such revenue bonds and revenue warrants may be issued and sold in accordance with chapter 39.46 RCW.</p>

<p>Neither the holder nor the owner of local improvement bonds and/or warrants guaranteed hereunder shall have a claim therefor against the public utility district, except for payment from the special assessment made for the improvement for which the bonds and/or warrants were issued, and except as against the guaranty fund. The district shall not be liable to any holder or owner of such local improvement bonds and/or warrants for any loss to the guaranty fund occurring in the lawful operation thereof by the district. The remedy of the holder of a local improvement bond and/or warrant shall be confined to the enforcement of the assessment and to the guaranty fund. A copy of the foregoing part of this section shall be plainly written, printed, or engraved on each local improvement bond and/or warrant guaranteed hereby. The establishment of a guaranty fund shall not be deemed at variance from any comprehensive plan heretofore adopted by a district.</p>
<p>If a guaranty fund at any time has balance therein in cash, and the obligations guaranteed thereby have all been paid off, the balance may be transferred to such other fund of the district as the commissioners shall, by resolution, direct.</p>
