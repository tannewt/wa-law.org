<p>Bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter shall be payable solely out of operating revenues of the port district. Such bonds shall be authorized by resolution adopted by the port commission, which resolution shall create a special fund or funds into which the port commission may obligate and bind the port district to set aside and pay any part or parts of, or all of, or a fixed proportion of, or a fixed amount of the gross revenue of the port district for the purpose of paying the principal of and interest on such bonds as the same shall become due, and if deemed necessary to maintain adequate reserves therefor. Such fund or funds shall be drawn upon solely for the purpose of paying the principal and interest upon the bonds issued pursuant to this chapter.</p>
<p>The bonds shall be negotiable instruments within the provisions and intent of the negotiable instruments law of this state, even though they shall be payable solely from such special fund or funds, and the tax revenue of the port district may not be used to pay, secure, or guarantee the payment of the principal of and interest on such bonds. The bonds and any coupons attached thereto shall state upon their face that they are payable solely from such special fund or funds. If the port commission fails to set aside and pay into such fund or funds the payments provided for in such resolution, the owner of any such bonds may bring suit to compel compliance with the provisions of the resolution.</p>
