<p>The treasurer of the county in which a port district is located shall be treasurer of the district unless the commission of a port district which has for the last three consecutive years received annual gross operating revenues of one hundred thousand dollars or more, excluding tax revenues and grants for capital purposes, designates by resolution some other person having experience in financial or fiscal matters as treasurer of the port district to act with the same powers and under the same restrictions as provided by law for a county treasurer acting on behalf of a port district: PROVIDED, That any port district which was authorized by the county treasurer to appoint its own treasurer prior to July 24, 1983, may continue to appoint its own treasurer. The commission may, and if the treasurer is not the county treasurer it shall, require a bond, with a surety company authorized to do business in the state of Washington, in an amount and under the terms and conditions which the commission by resolution from time to time finds will protect the district against loss. The premium on such bonds shall be paid by the district. All district funds shall be paid to the treasurer and shall be disbursed by him or her upon warrants signed by a port auditor appointed by the port commission, upon vouchers approved by the commission.</p>

<p>A port district having adopted a comprehensive scheme of harbor improvements and industrial developments may thereafter raise revenue, for six years only, and a second six years if the procedures are followed under subsection (2) of this section, in addition to all other revenues now authorized by law, by an annual levy not to exceed forty-five cents per thousand dollars of assessed value against the assessed valuation of the taxable property in such port district. In addition, if voters approve a ballot proposition authorizing additional levies by a simple majority vote, a port district located in a county bordering on the Pacific Ocean having adopted a comprehensive scheme of harbor improvements and industrial developments may impose these levies for a third six-year period. Said levies shall be used exclusively for the exercise of the powers granted to port districts under chapter 53.25 RCW except as provided in *RCW 53.36.110. The levy of such taxes is herein authorized notwithstanding the provisions of RCW 84.52.050 and 84.52.043. The revenues derived from levies made under *RCW 53.36.100 and 53.36.110 not expended in the year in which the levies are made may be paid into a fund for future use in carrying out the powers granted under chapter 53.25 RCW, which fund may be accumulated and carried over from year to year, with the right to continue to levy the taxes provided for in *RCW 53.36.100 and 53.36.110 for the purposes herein authorized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a port district intends to levy a tax under this section for one or more years after the first six years these levies were imposed, the port commission shall publish notice of this intention, in one or more newspapers of general circulation within the district, by June 1 of the year in which the first levy of the seventh through twelfth year period is to be made. If within ninety days of the date of publication a petition is filed with the county auditor containing the signatures of eight percent of the number of voters registered and voting in the port district for the office of the governor at the last preceding gubernatorial election, the county auditor shall canvass the signatures in the same manner as prescribed in RCW 29A.72.230 and certify their sufficiency to the port commission within two weeks. The proposition to make these levies in the seventh through twelfth year period shall be submitted to the voters of the port district at a special election, called for this purpose, no later than the date on which a primary election would be held under RCW 29A.04.311. The levies may be made in the seventh through twelfth year period only if approved by a majority of the voters of the port district voting on the proposition.</p>
