## 33.40.050 - Involuntary liquidation—Procedure—Federal insurance corporation as liquidator.

Upon the filing with and approval by the court of the bond, the director or other person appointed shall enter upon the duties as liquidator of the affairs of the association, and, under the direction of the court, shall administer and liquidate the assets thereof and apply the same to the payment of the expenses of liquidation and the debts of the association, and distribute the remainder to the deposit accounts proportionately.

If the court tenders the appointment as liquidator to the federal savings and loan insurance corporation, and if the insurance corporation accepts the appointment, it shall have and possess all the powers and privileges provided by the laws of this state with respect to a liquidator of an association, its depositors and other creditors, and be subject to all the duties of such liquidator, except insofar as such powers, privileges, or duties are in conflict with the provisions of Title IV of the National Housing Act, as now or hereafter amended.
