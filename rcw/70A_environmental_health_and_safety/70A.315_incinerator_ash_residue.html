<p>The legislature finds:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Solid wastes generated in the state are to be managed in the following order of descending priority: (a) Waste reduction; (b) recycling; (c) treatment; (d) energy recovery or incineration; (e) solidification/stabilization; and (f) landfill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Special incinerator ash residues from the incineration of municipal solid waste that would otherwise be regulated as hazardous wastes need a separate regulatory scheme in order to (a) ease the permitting and reporting requirements of chapter 70A.300 RCW, the state hazardous waste management act, and (b) supplement the environmental protection provisions of chapter 70A.205 RCW, the state solid waste management act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Raw garbage poses significant environmental and public health risks. Municipal solid waste incineration constitutes a higher waste management priority than the land disposal of untreated municipal solid waste due to its reduction of waste volumes and environmental health risks.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is therefore the purpose of this chapter to establish management requirements for special incinerator ash that otherwise would be regulated as hazardous waste under chapter 70A.300 RCW, the hazardous waste management act.</p>

<p>Prior to managing special incinerator ash, persons who generate special incinerator ash shall develop plans for managing the special incinerator ash. These plans shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Identify procedures for all aspects relating to the management of the special incinerator ash that are necessary to protect employees, human health, and the environment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify alternatives for managing solid waste prior to incineration for the purpose of (i) reducing the toxicity of the special incinerator ash; and (ii) reducing the quantity of the special incinerator ash;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish a process for submittal of an annual report to the department disclosing the results of a testing program to identify the toxic properties of the special incinerator ash as necessary to ensure that the procedures established in the plans submitted pursuant to this chapter are adequate to protect employees, human health, and the environment; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comply with the rules established by the department in accordance with this section.</p>

Prior to approving a plan, the department shall find that the plan complies with the provisions of this chapter, including any rules adopted under this chapter. Approval may be conditioned upon additional requirements necessary to protect employees, human health, and the environment, including special management requirements, waste segregation, or treatment techniques such as neutralization, detoxification, and solidification/stabilization.</p>

<li>
<p>Prior to accepting any special incinerator ash for disposal, persons owning or operating facilities for the disposal of the incinerator ash shall apply to the department for a permit. The department shall issue a permit if the disposal will provide adequate protection of human health and the environment. Prior to issuance of any permit, the department shall find that the facility meets the requirements of chapter 70A.205 RCW and any rules adopted under this chapter. The department may place conditions on the permit to include additional requirements necessary to protect employees, human health, and the environment, including special management requirements, waste segregation, or treatment techniques such as neutralization, detoxification, and solidification/stabilization.</p>

<li>
<p>The department shall adopt rules to implement the provisions of this chapter. The rules shall (a) establish minimum requirements for the management of special incinerator ash as necessary to protect employees, human health, and the environment, (b) clearly define the elements of the plans required by this chapter, and (c) require special incinerator ash to be disposed at facilities that are operating in compliance with this chapter.</p>
