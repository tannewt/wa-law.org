<p>The legislature finds:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>That environmental damage seriously endangers the public health and welfare;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That such environmental damage results from air, water, and other resources pollution and from solid waste disposal, noise and other environmental problems;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That to abate or control such environmental damage antipollution devices, equipment, and facilities must be acquired, constructed and installed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the tax exempt financing permitted by Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, and authorized by this chapter results in lower costs of installation of pollution control facilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That such lower costs benefit the public with no measurable cost impact;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the method of financing provided in this chapter is in the public interest and its use serves a public purpose in (a) protecting and promoting the health and welfare of the citizens of the cities, towns, counties, and port districts and of this state by encouraging and accelerating the installation of facilities for abating or controlling and preventing environmental damage and (b) in attracting and retaining environmentally sound industry in this state which reduces unemployment and provides a more diversified tax base.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the reasons set forth in subsection (6) of this section, the provisions of this chapter relating to port districts and all proceedings heretofore or hereafter taken by port districts pursuant thereto are, and shall be deemed to be, for industrial development as authorized by Article 8, section 8 of the Washington state Constitution.</p>
</li>

<p>This chapter shall be liberally construed to accomplish the intentions expressed in this section.</p>

<li>
<p>The proceedings authorizing any bonds under the provisions of this chapter and any mortgage securing such bonds may provide that, in the event of a default in the payment of the principal of or the interest on such bonds or in the performance of any agreement contained in such proceedings or mortgage, such payment and performance may be enforced by mandamus or by the appointment of a receiver in equity with power to charge and collect rents and to apply the revenues from the facilities in accordance with such proceedings or the provisions of such mortgage.</p>

Such mortgage may also provide that any trustee under such mortgage or the owner of any of the bonds secured thereby may become the purchaser at any foreclosure sale if the highest bidder therefor. No breach of any such agreement shall impose any pecuniary liability upon a municipality or any charge upon their general credit or against their taxing powers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proceedings authorizing the issuance of bonds hereunder may provide for the appointment of a trustee or trustees for the protection of the owners of the bonds, whether or not a mortgage is entered into as security for such bonds. Any such trustee may be a bank with trust powers or a trust company and shall be located in the United States, within or without the state of Washington, shall have the immunities, powers and duties provided in said proceedings, and may, to the extent permitted by such proceedings, hold and invest funds deposited with it in direct obligations of the United States, obligations guaranteed by the United States or certificates of deposit of a bank (including the trustee) which are continuously secured by such obligations of or guaranteed by the United States. Any bank acting as such trustee may, to the extent permitted by such proceedings, buy bonds issued hereunder to the same extent as if it were not such trustee. Said proceedings may provide for one or more co-trustees, and any co-trustee may be any competent individual over the age of twenty-one years or a bank having trust powers or trust company within or without the state.
