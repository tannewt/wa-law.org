<p>The legislature finds and declares that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is a matter of statewide concern that biomedical waste be handled in a manner that protects the health, safety, and welfare of the public, the environment, and the workers who handle the waste.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infectious disease transmission has not been identified from improperly disposed biomedical waste, but the potential for such transmission may be present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A uniform, statewide definition of biomedical waste will simplify compliance with local regulations while preserving local control of biomedical waste management.</p>
