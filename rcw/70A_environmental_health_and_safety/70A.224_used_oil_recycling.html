<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Millions of gallons of used oil are generated each year in this state, and used oil is a valuable petroleum resource that can be recycled;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The improper collection, transportation, recycling, use, or disposal of used oil contributes to the pollution of air, water, and land, and endangers public health and welfare;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The private sector is a vital resource in the collection and recycling of used oil and should be involved in its collection and recycling whenever practicable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In light of the harmful consequences of improper disposal and use of used oil, and its value as a resource, the legislature declares that the collection, recycling, and reuse of used oil is in the public interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department, when appropriate, should promote the rerefining of used oil in its grants, public education, regulatory, and other programs.</p>
