<p>Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been used extensively as flame retardants in a large number of common household products for the past thirty years. Studies on animals show that PBDEs can impact the developing brain, affecting behavior and learning after birth and into adulthood, making exposure to fetuses and children a particular concern. Levels of PBDEs are increasing in people, and in the environment, particularly in North America. Because people can be exposed to these chemicals through house dust and indoor air as well as through food, it is important to phase out their use in common household products, provided that effective flame retardants that are safer and technically feasible are available at a reasonable cost.</p>

This prohibition may not take effect until the department and the department of health identify that a safer and technically feasible alternative is available, and the fire safety committee, created in RCW 70A.405.040, determines that the identified alternative meets applicable fire safety standards.

</li>
<li>
<p>By majority vote, the fire safety committee created in RCW 70A.405.040 shall make a finding whether an alternative identified under (b) of this subsection meets applicable fire safety standards. The fire safety committee shall report their finding to the state fire marshal. After reviewing the finding of the fire safety committee, the state fire marshal shall determine whether an alternative identified under (b) of this subsection meets applicable fire safety standards. The determination of the fire marshal must be based upon the finding of the fire safety committee. The state fire marshal shall report the determination to the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall seek public input on their findings, the findings of the fire safety committee, and the determination by the state fire marshal. The department shall publish these findings in the Washington State Register, and submit them in a report to the appropriate committees of the legislature. The department shall initially report these findings by December 31, 2008.</p>

<p>The effective date of the prohibition is as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">

</li>
<li>
<p>If the December 31, 2008, report required in subsection (2)(d) of this section does not find that a safer and technically feasible alternative that meets applicable fire safety standards is available, the prohibition does not take effect January 1, 2011. Beginning in 2009, by December 31st of each year, the department shall review and report on alternatives as described in subsection (2) of this section. The prohibition in subsection (2) of this section takes effect two years after a report submitted to the legislature required under subsection (2)(d) of this section finds that a safer and technically feasible alternative that meets applicable fire safety standards is available.</p>
