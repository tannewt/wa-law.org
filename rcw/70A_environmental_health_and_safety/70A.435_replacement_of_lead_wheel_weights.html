<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Environmental health hazards associated with lead wheel weights are a preventable problem. People are exposed to lead fragments and dust when lead wheel weights fall from motor vehicles onto Washington roadways and are then abraded and pulverized by traffic. Lead wheel weights on and alongside roadways can contribute to soil, surface, and groundwater contamination and pose hazards to downstream aquatic life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lead negatively affects every bodily system. While it is injurious to people of all ages, lead is especially harmful to fetuses, children, and adults of childbearing age. Effects of lead on a child's cognitive, behavioral, and developmental abilities may necessitate large expenditures of public funds for health care and special education. Irreversible damage to children and subsequent expenditures could be avoided if exposure to lead is reduced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are no federal regulatory controls governing use of lead wheel weights. The legislature recognizes the state's need to protect the public from exposure to lead hazards.</p>

<li>
<p>On and after January 1, 2011, a person who replaces or balances motor vehicle tires must replace lead wheel weights with environmentally preferred wheel weights on all vehicles when they replace or balance tires in Washington. However, the person may use alternatives to lead wheel weights that are determined by the department to not qualify as environmentally preferred wheel weights for up to two years following the date of that determination, but must thereafter use environmentally preferred wheel weights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person who is subject to the requirement in subsection (1) of this section must recycle the lead wheel weights that they remove.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person who fails to comply with subsection (1) of this section is subject to penalties prescribed in RCW 70A.435.050. A violation of subsection (1) of this section occurs with respect to each vehicle for which lead wheel weights are not replaced in compliance with subsection (1) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An owner of a vehicle is not subject to any requirement in this section.</p>

<p>Persons that replace or balance motor vehicle tires in Washington; and</p>
