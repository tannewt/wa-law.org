<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that rapid innovations in low carbon transportation technologies, including electric vehicles and clean transportation fuels, are at the threshold of widespread commercial deployment. In order to help prompt the use of clean fuels, other states have successfully implemented programs that reduce the carbon intensity of their transportation fuels. California and Oregon have both implemented low carbon fuel standards that are similar to the program created in chapter 317, Laws of 2021, and both states have experienced biofuel sector growth and have successfully sited large biofuel projects that had originally been planned for Washington. Washington state has extensively studied the potential impact of a clean fuels program, and most projections show that a low carbon fuel standard would decrease greenhouse gas and conventional air pollutant emissions, while positively impacting the state's economy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that the health and welfare of the people of the state of Washington is threatened by the prospect of crumbling or swamped coastlines, rising water, and more intense forest fires caused by higher temperatures and related droughts, all of which are intensified and made more frequent by the volume of greenhouse gas emissions. As of 2017, the transportation sector contributes 45 percent of Washington's greenhouse gas emissions, and the legislature's interest in the life cycle of the fuels used in the state arises from a concern for the effects of the production and use of these fuels on Washington's environment and public health, including its air quality, snowpack, and coastline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to support the deployment of clean transportation fuel technologies through a carefully designed program that reduces the carbon intensity of fuel used in Washington, in order to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Reduce levels of conventional air pollutants from diesel and gasoline that are harmful to public health;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation fuels, which are the state's largest source of greenhouse gas emissions; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create jobs and spur economic development based on innovative clean fuel technologies.</p>

<li>
<p>The director of the department may issue an order declaring an emergency deferral of compliance with the carbon intensity standard established under RCW 70A.535.020 no later than 15 calendar days after the date the department determines, in consultation with the governor's office and the department of commerce, that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Extreme and unusual circumstances exist that prevent the distribution of an adequate supply of renewable fuels needed for regulated parties to comply with the clean fuels program taking into consideration all available methods of obtaining sufficient credits to comply with the standard;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The extreme and unusual circumstances are the result of a natural disaster, an act of God, a significant supply chain disruption or production facility equipment failure, or another event that could not reasonably have been foreseen or prevented and not the lack of prudent planning on the part of the suppliers of the fuels to the state; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is in the public interest to grant the deferral such as when a deferral is necessary to meet projected temporary shortfalls in the supply of the renewable fuel in the state and that other methods of obtaining compliance credits are unavailable to compensate for the shortage of renewable fuel supply.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the director of the department makes the determination required under subsection (1) of this section, such a temporary extreme and unusual deferral is permitted only if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The deferral applies only for the shortest time necessary to address the extreme and unusual circumstances;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The deferral is effective for the shortest practicable time period the director of the department determines necessary to permit the correction of the extreme and unusual circumstances; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director has given public notice of a proposed deferral.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An order declaring an emergency deferral under this section must set forth:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The duration of the emergency deferral;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The types of fuel to which the emergency deferral applies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which of the following methods the department has selected for deferring compliance with the clean fuels program during the emergency deferral:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Temporarily adjusting the scheduled applicable carbon intensity standard to a standard identified in the order that better reflects the availability of credits during the emergency deferral and requiring regulated parties to comply with the temporary standard;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowing for the carryover of deficits accrued during the emergency deferral into the next compliance period without penalty; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suspending deficit accrual during the emergency deferral period.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An emergency deferral may be terminated prior to the expiration date of the emergency deferral if new information becomes available indicating that the shortage that provided the basis for the emergency deferral has ended. The director of the department shall consult with the department of commerce and the governor's office in making an early termination decision. Termination of an emergency deferral is effective 15 calendar days after the date that the order declaring the termination is adopted.</p>

<p>In addition to the emergency deferral specified in subsection (1) of this section, the department may issue a full or partial deferral for one calendar quarter of a person's obligation to furnish credits for compliance under RCW 70A.535.030 if it finds that the person is unable to comply with the requirements of this chapter due to reasons beyond the person's reasonable control. The department may initiate a deferral under this subsection at its own discretion or at the request of a person regulated under this chapter. The department may renew issued deferrals. In evaluating whether to issue a deferral under this subsection, the department may consider the results of the fuel supply forecast in RCW 70A.535.100, but is not bound in its decision-making discretion by the results of the forecast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the department issues a deferral pursuant to this subsection, the department may:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Direct the person subject to the deferral to file a progress report on achieving full compliance with the requirements of this chapter within an amount of time determined to be reasonable by the department; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Direct the person to take specific actions to achieve full compliance with the requirements of this chapter.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>The issuance of a deferral under this subsection does not permanently relieve the deferral recipient of the obligation to comply with the requirements of this chapter.</p>

<p>The department may require that persons that are required or elect to register or report under this chapter pay a fee. If the department elects to require program participants to pay a fee, the department must, after an opportunity for public review and comment, adopt rules to establish a process to determine the payment schedule and the amount of the fee charged. The amount of the fee must be set so as to equal but not exceed the projected direct and indirect costs to the department for developing and implementing the program and the projected direct and indirect costs to the department of commerce to carry out its responsibilities under RCW 70A.535.100. The department and the department of commerce must prepare a biennial workload analysis and provide an opportunity for public review of and comment on the workload analysis. The department shall enter into an interagency agreement with the department of commerce to implement this section.</p>

<p>By December 1, 2030, the joint legislative audit and review committee must analyze the impacts of the initial five years of clean fuels program implementation and must submit a report summarizing the analysis to the legislature. The analysis must include, at minimum, the following components:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Costs and benefits, including environmental and public health costs and benefits, associated with this chapter for categories of persons participating in the clean fuels program or that are most impacted by air pollution, as defined in consultation with the departments of ecology and health and as measured on a census tract scale. This component of the analysis must, at minimum, assess the costs and benefits of changes in the following metrics since the start of the program:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Levels of greenhouse gas emissions and criteria air pollutants for which the United States environmental protection agency has established national ambient air quality standards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fuel prices; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Total employment in categories of industries generating credits or deficits. The categories of industries assessed must include but are not limited to electric utilities, oil refineries, and other industries involved in the production of high carbon fuels, industries involved in the delivery and sale of high carbon fuels, biofuel refineries, and industries involved in the delivery and sale of low carbon fuels;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An evaluation of the information calculated and provided by the department under RCW 70A.535.090(1);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A summary of the estimated total statewide costs and benefits attributable to the clean fuels program, including state agency administrative costs and regulated entity compliance costs. For purposes of calculating the benefits of the program, the summary may rely, in part, on a constant value of the social costs attributable to greenhouse gas emissions, as identified in contemporary internationally accepted estimates of such global social cost. This summary must include an estimate of the total statewide costs of the program per ton of greenhouse gas emissions reductions achieved by the clean fuels program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An evaluation of the impacts of the program on low-income households; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The outcomes of proposals to site biofuel facilities through the energy facility site evaluation council review process that is allowed by RCW 80.50.060(2).</p>
