<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The milling of uranium and thorium creates potential hazards to the health of the citizens of the state of Washington in that potentially hazardous radioactive isotopes, decay products of uranium and thorium, naturally occurring in relatively dispersed geologic formations, are brought to one location on the surface and pulverized in the process of mining and milling uranium and thorium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These radioactive isotopes, in addition to creating a field of gamma radiation in the vicinity of the tailings area, also exude potentially hazardous radioactive gas and particulates into the atmosphere from the tailings areas, and contaminate the milling facilities, thereby creating hazards which will be present for many generations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The public health and welfare of the citizens demands that the state assure that the public health be protected by requiring that: (a) Prior to the termination of any radioactive materials license, all milling facilities and associated tailings piles will be decommissioned in such a manner as to bring the potential public health hazard to a minimum; and (b) such environmental radiation monitoring as is necessary to verify the status of decommissioned facilities will be conducted.</p>

<li>
<p>Any person who proposes to operate a uranium or thorium mill within the state of Washington after January 1, 1980, shall obtain a license from the department to mill thorium and uranium. The period of the license shall be determined by the secretary and shall be initially valid for not more than two years and renewable thereafter for periods of not more than five years. No license may be granted unless:</p>

<li>
<p>The owner or operator of the mill submits to the department a plan for reclamation and disposal of tailings and for decommissioning the site that conforms to the criteria and standards then in effect for the protection of the public safety and health; and</p>

<p>The owner of the mill agrees to transfer or revert to the appropriate state or federal agency upon termination of the license all lands, buildings, and grounds, and any interests therein, necessary to fulfill the purposes of this chapter except where the lands are held in trust for or are owned by any Indian tribe.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any person operating a uranium or thorium mill on January 1, 1980, shall, at the time of application for renewal of his or her license to mill thorium or uranium, comply with the following conditions for continued operation of the mill:</p>

The department shall make a written determination as to the licensing of the mill which is based upon the findings included in the determination and upon the evidence presented during the public comment period. The determination is subject to judicial review. If a declaration of nonsignificance is issued for a license renewal application under rules adopted under chapter 43.21C RCW, the public hearing is not required.</p>

<p>On a quarterly basis on and after January 1, 1980, there shall be levied and the department shall collect a charge of five cents per pound on each pound of uranium or thorium compound milled out of the raw ore. All moneys paid to the department from these charges shall be deposited in a special security fund in the treasury of the state of Washington to be known as the &quot;radiation perpetual maintenance fund.&quot; This security fund shall be used by the department when a licensee has ceased to operate and the site may still contain, or have associated with the site at which the licensed activity was conducted in spite of full compliance with RCW 70A.310.030, radioactive material which will require further maintenance, surveillance, or other care. If, with respect to a licensee, the department determines that the estimated total of these charges will be less than or greater than that required to defray the estimated cost of administration of this responsibility, the department may prescribe such an increased or decreased charge as is considered necessary for this purpose. If, at termination of the license, the department determines that by the applicable standards and practices then in effect, the charges which have been collected from the licensee and earnings generated therefrom are in excess of the amount required to defray the cost of this responsibility, the department may refund the excess portion to the licensee.
