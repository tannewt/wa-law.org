<p>The legislature finds and declares that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The management of solid waste can pose a wide range of hazards to public health and safety and to the environment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Packaging comprises a significant percentage of the overall solid waste stream;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The presence of heavy metals in packaging is a part of the total concern in light of their likely presence in emissions or ash when packaging is incinerated, or in leachate when packaging is landfilled;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lead, mercury, cadmium, and hexavalent chromium, on the basis of available scientific and medical evidence, are of particular concern;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The intent of this chapter is to achieve a reduction in toxicity without impeding or discouraging the expanded use of postconsumer materials in the production of packaging and its components.</p>

<p>A certificate of compliance stating that a package or packaging component is in compliance with the requirements of this chapter shall be developed by its manufacturer. For food packaging, a manufacturer shall develop a compliance certificate by the date of a prohibition taking effect under RCW 70A.222.070. If compliance is achieved under the exemption or exemptions provided in RCW 70A.222.030, the certificate shall state the specific basis upon which the exemption is claimed. The certificate of compliance shall be signed by an authorized official of the manufacturing company. The certificate of compliance shall be kept on file by the manufacturer for as long as the package or packaging component is in use, and for three years from the date of the last sale or distribution by the manufacturer. Certificates of compliance, or copies thereof, shall be furnished to the department of ecology upon request within sixty days. If manufacturers are required under any other state statute to provide a certificate of compliance, one certificate may be developed containing all required information.</p>
<p>If the manufacturer or supplier of the package or packaging component reformulates or creates a new package or packaging component, the manufacturer shall develop an amended or new certificate of compliance for the reformulated or new package or packaging component.</p>

<li>
<p>Beginning January 1, 2022, no person may manufacture, knowingly sell, offer for sale, distribute for sale, or distribute for use in this state food packaging to which PFAS chemicals have been intentionally added in any amount. This prohibition may not take effect until the department of ecology completes the following: (a) Identifies that safer alternatives are available, and the safer alternative determination is supported by feedback from an external peer review of the department's alternatives assessment; and (b) publishes findings, as required under subsection (3) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To determine whether safer alternatives to PFAS chemicals exist, the department of ecology must conduct an alternatives assessment as part of the PFAS chemical action plan that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Evaluates less toxic chemicals and nonchemical alternatives to replace the use of a chemical;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follows the guidelines for alternatives assessments issued by the interstate chemicals clearinghouse; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Includes, at a minimum, an evaluation of chemical hazards, exposure, performance, cost, and availability.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>By January 1, 2020, the department of ecology must publish its findings in the Washington State Register on whether safer alternatives to PFAS chemicals in specific applications of food packaging are available for each assessed application and submit a report with the findings and the feedback from the peer review of the department's alternatives assessment to the appropriate committees of the legislature. In order to determine that safer alternatives are available, the safer alternatives must be readily available in sufficient quantity and at a comparable cost, and perform as well as or better than PFAS chemicals in a specific food packaging application. If an alternative is a chemical, it must have previously been approved for food contact by the United States food and drug administration, such as through the issuance of a determination that the chemical has a reasonable certainty of causing no harm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The prohibition on the use of PFAS chemicals in food packaging:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Becomes effective January 1, 2022, if the report required under subsection (3) of this section finds that safer alternatives are available for specific food packaging applications;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does not take effect January 1, 2022, if the report required under subsection (3) of this section does not find that safer alternatives are available for specific food packaging applications.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the department of ecology does not find that a safer alternative is available for some or all categories of food packaging applications, beginning January 1, 2021, and each year following, the department of ecology must review and report on alternatives as described in subsection (2) of this section. The prohibition in this section for specific food packaging applications takes effect two years after a report submitted to the legislature required under subsection (3) of this section finds that safer alternatives are available.</p>
