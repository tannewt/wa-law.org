<p>The legislature finds that, to the extent that electronic media, including television, motion pictures, video games, and entertainment uses of virtual reality are conducive to increased violent behaviors, especially in children, the state has a duty to protect the public health and safety.</p>
<p>Many parents, educators, and others are concerned about protecting children and youth from the negative influences of the media, and want more information about media content and more control over media contact with their children.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that, as a matter of public health and safety, access by minors to violent videos and violent video games is the responsibility of parents and guardians.</p>
<p>Public libraries, with the exception of university, college, and community college libraries, shall establish policies on minors' access to violent videos and violent video games. Libraries shall make their policies known to the public in their communities.</p>
<p>Each library system shall formulate its own policies, and may, in its discretion, include public hearings, consultation with community networks as defined under chapter 70.190 RCW, or consultation with the Washington library association in the development of its policies.</p>
