<p>Whenever any person, firm, or corporation engaged in the sale of equipment, repair parts, or services therefor enters into a written or oral contract with a supplier of equipment, or repair parts whereby the dealer agrees to maintain a stock of parts and equipment and either party to such contract desires to cancel or discontinue the contract, unless the dealer should desire to keep such parts and equipment the supplier shall pay the dealer for the equipment and reasonable reimbursement for services performed in connection with assembly and predelivery inspections of the equipment. The payment shall be in the amount of one hundred percent of the net cost of all unused complete equipment, including transportation charges paid by the dealer. Equipment purchased more than twenty-four months prior to the cancellation or discontinuance of the dealer agreement is subject to a weather allowance adjustment. The supplier assumes ownership of new unused complete equipment F.O.B. the dealer location. The supplier shall pay the dealer in the amount of ninety-five percent of the current net prices on repair parts, including superseded parts listed in current price lists, catalogs, or electronic catalogs which parts had previously been purchased from the supplier and held by the dealer on the date of the cancellation or discontinuance of such contract or thereafter received by the dealer from the supplier. The supplier shall also pay the dealer a sum equal to five percent of the current net price of all parts returned for the handling, packing, and loading of such parts for return, unless the supplier elects to catalog or list the inventory and perform packing and loading of the parts itself. However, the provisions of this section shall apply only to repair parts which are new, unused, and in resalable condition. The provisions of this section do not apply to repair parts that were purchased by the dealer in sets of multiple parts unless the sets are complete and in resalable condition, or to parts the supplier can demonstrate were identified as nonreturnable when ordered by the dealer.</p>
<p>Upon the payment of such amounts, the title to the equipment or repair parts shall pass to the supplier making such payment, and the supplier shall be entitled to the possession of such equipment and repair parts.</p>
<p>All payments or allowances of credit due dealers under this section shall be paid or credited by the supplier within ninety days after the return of the repair parts or the transfer of equipment. After the ninety days, all sums of credits due include interest at the rate of eighteen percent per year. Title to equipment, attachments, and accessories is transferred to the supplier F.O.B. the dealer location.</p>
<p>The provisions of this section shall apply to any part return adjustment agreement made between a dealer and a supplier.</p>
<p>A supplier must repurchase specific data processing and computer communications hardware specifically required by the supplier to meet the supplier's minimum requirements and purchased by the dealer in the prior five years and held by the dealer on the date of termination. The supplier must also purchase software required by and sourced from the supplier, provided that the software is used exclusively to support the dealer's business with the supplier. The purchase price is the original net cost to the dealer, less twenty percent per year.</p>
<p>A supplier must repurchase, and the dealer must sell to the supplier, specialized repair tools. As applied in this section, specialized repair tools are defined as those tools required by the supplier and unique to the diagnosis or repair of the supplier's products. For specialized repair tools that are in new, unused condition and are applicable to the supplier's current products, the purchase price is one hundred percent of the original net cost to the dealer. For all other specialized repair tools, the purchase price is the original net cost to the dealer less twenty percent per year.</p>
<p>A supplier must repurchase, and the dealer must sell to the supplier, current signage. As used in this section, &quot;current signage&quot; means the principal outdoor signage required by the supplier that displays the supplier's current logo or similar exclusive identifier, and that identifies the dealer as representing either the supplier or the supplier's products, or both. The purchase price is the original net cost to the dealer less twenty percent per year, but may in no case be less than fifty percent of the original net cost to the dealer.</p>
<p>The provisions of this section shall be supplemental to any agreement between the dealer and the supplier covering the return of equipment and repair parts so that the dealer can elect to pursue either his or her contract remedy or the remedy provided herein, and an election by the dealer to pursue his or her contract remedy shall not bar his or her right to the remedy provided herein as to equipment and repair parts not affected by the contract remedy.</p>
<p>The provisions of this section shall apply to all contracts now in effect which have no expiration date and are a continuing contract, and all other contracts entered into or renewed after January 1, 1976. Any contract in force and effect on January 1, 1976, which by its own terms will terminate on a date subsequent thereto shall be governed by the law as it existed prior to this chapter: PROVIDED, That no contract covered by this chapter may be canceled by any party without good cause. For the purposes of this section, good cause shall include, but shall not be restricted to, the failure of any party to comply with the lawful provisions of the contract, the adjudication of any party to a contract as a bankrupt, wrongful refusal of the supplier to supply equipment and repair parts therefor.</p>

<p>It shall be a violation of this chapter for a supplier to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Require or attempt to require any dealer to order or accept delivery of any equipment or parts that the dealer has not voluntarily ordered;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Require or attempt to require any dealer to enter into any agreement, whether written or oral, supplementary to an existing dealer agreement with the supplier, unless such supplementary agreement is imposed on other similarly situated dealers in the state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refuse to deliver in reasonable quantities and within a reasonable time after receipt of the dealer's order, to any dealer having a dealer agreement for the retail sale of new equipment sold or distributed by the supplier, equipment covered by the dealer agreement specifically advertised or represented by the supplier to be available for immediate delivery. However, the failure to deliver any such equipment shall not be considered a violation of this chapter when deliveries are based on prior ordering histories, the priority given to the sequence in which the orders are received, or manufacturing schedules or if the failure is due to prudent and reasonable restriction on extension of credit by the supplier to the dealer, an act of God, work stoppage or delay due to a strike or labor difficulty, a bona fide shortage of materials, freight embargo, or other cause over which the supplier has no control;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terminate, cancel, or fail to renew the dealer agreement of any dealer or substantially change the dealer's competitive circumstances, attempt to terminate or cancel, or threaten to not renew the dealer agreement or to substantially change the competitive circumstances without good cause;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Condition the renewal, continuation, or extension of a dealer agreement on the dealer's substantial renovation of the dealer's place of business or on the construction, purchase, acquisition, or rental of a new place of business by the dealer unless: The supplier has advised the dealer in writing of its demand for such renovation, construction, purchase, acquisition, or rental within a reasonable time prior to the effective date of the proposed date of renewal or extensions, but in no case less than one year; the supplier demonstrates the need for such change in the place of business and the reasonableness of the demand with respect to marketing and servicing the supplier's product and any economic conditions existing at the time in the dealer's trade area; and the dealer does not make a good faith effort to complete the construction or renovation plans within one year;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discriminate in the prices charged for equipment of like grade, quality, and brand sold by the supplier to similarly situated dealers in this state. This subsection does not prevent the use of differentials which make only due allowance for differences in the cost of manufacture, sale, or delivery resulting from the differing methods or quantities in which such commodities are sold or delivered: PROVIDED, That nothing shall prevent a supplier from offering a lower price in order to meet an equally low price of a competitor, or the services or facilities furnished by a competitor;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prevent, by contract or otherwise, any equipment dealer from changing the capital structure of the equipment dealership or the means by which the equipment dealership is financed, provided the equipment dealer at all times meets any reasonable capital standards imposed by the supplier or as otherwise agreed to between the equipment dealer and supplier, and provided this change by the equipment dealer does not result in a change of the controlling interest in the executive management or board of directors, or any guarantors of the equipment dealership;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prevent, by contract or otherwise, any equipment dealer or any officer, member, partner, or stockholder of any equipment dealer from selling or transferring any part of the interest of any of them to any other party or parties. However, no equipment dealer, officer, partner, member, or stockholder has the right to sell, transfer, or assign the equipment dealership or power of management or control of the dealership without the written consent of the supplier. Should a supplier determine that the designated transferee is not acceptable, the supplier shall provide the equipment dealer with written notice of the supplier's objection and specific reasons for withholding its consent;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Withhold consent to a transfer of interest in an equipment dealership unless, with due regard to regional market conditions and distribution economies, the dealer's area of responsibility or trade area does not afford sufficient sales potential to reasonably support a dealer. In any dispute between a supplier and an equipment dealer, the supplier bears the burden of proving that the dealer's area of responsibility or trade area does not afford sufficient sales potential to reasonably support a dealer. The proof offered must be in writing. The provisions of this subsection do not preclude any other basis for a supplier to withhold consent to a transfer of interest in an equipment dealer;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fail to compensate a dealer for preparation and delivery of equipment that the supplier sells or leases for use within this state and that the dealer prepares for delivery and delivers;</p>

<li>
<p>Require a dealer to assent to a release, assignment, novation, waiver, or estoppel that would relieve any person from liability imposed by this chapter; or</p>

<p>Unreasonably withhold consent, in the event of the death of the dealer or the principal owner of the dealership, to the transfer of the dealer's interest in the dealership to another qualified individual if the qualified individual meets the reasonable financial, business experience, and character standards required by the supplier. Should a supplier determine that the designated qualified individual does not meet those reasonable written standards, it shall provide the dealership, heirs to the dealership, or the estate of the dealer with written notice of its objection and specific reasons for withholding its consent. A supplier shall have sixty days to consider a dealer's request to make a transfer. If the qualified individual reasonably satisfies the supplier's objections within sixty days, the supplier shall approve the transfer.
