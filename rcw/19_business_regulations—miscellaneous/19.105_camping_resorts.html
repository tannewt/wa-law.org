<p>The camping resort operator delivers evidence to the director that any financial institution that has made a hypothecation loan to the camping resort operator (the &quot;hypothecation lender&quot;) shall have a lien on, or security interest in, the camping resort operator's interest in the campground, and the hypothecation lender shall have executed and recorded a nondisturbance agreement in the real estate records of the county in which the campground is located.

<p>If the director finds that the applicant or registrant has not by other means assured future availability to and quiet enjoyment of the campgrounds and facilities, as required under this chapter, the director may, notwithstanding the provisions of RCW 19.105.336, require impoundment of the funds or membership receivables, or both, from camping resort contract sales, including the impoundment of periodic dues or assessments required of purchasers under the contracts, or provide other assurances acceptable to the director, until sufficient funds have been impounded or arrangements made to alleviate the inadequacy. The director may, upon finding it reasonable and necessary, for compliance with RCW 19.105.336 and 19.105.365, and not inconsistent with the protection of purchasers or owners of camping resort contracts, provide for release to the applicant, registrant, or others of all or a portion of the impounded funds, membership receivables, or other assets in the impound.

<p>The legislature recognizes the proprietary interest camping resort operators have in purchaser lists. The legislature also recognizes that purchasers of camping resort contracts have a legitimate interest in being able to contact other resort purchasers for the purpose of forming a members' association. In balancing these competing interests, the legislature believes that purchaser lists can be made available to camping resort purchasers with reasonable restrictions on the dissemination of those lists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon request of a purchaser, the camping resort operator shall provide to the purchaser a list of the names, addresses, and unit, site, or purchaser number of all purchasers. The camping resort operator may charge for the reasonable costs for preparing the list. The operator shall require the purchaser to sign an affidavit agreeing not to use the list for any commercial purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a violation of this chapter and chapter 19.86 RCW for any person to use a membership list for commercial purposes unless authorized to do so by the operator.</p>
