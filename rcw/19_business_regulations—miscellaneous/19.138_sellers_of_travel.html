<p>The legislature finds and declares that advertising, sales, and business practices of certain sellers of travel have worked financial hardship upon the people of this state; that the travel business has a significant impact upon the economy and well-being of this state and its people; that problems have arisen regarding certain sales of travel; and that the public welfare requires registration of sellers of travel in order to eliminate unfair advertising, sales and business practices. The legislature further finds it necessary to establish standards that will safeguard the people against financial hardship and to encourage fair dealing and prosperity in the travel business.</p>

<p>Renewal of a registration is subject to the same provisions covering disciplinary action as a registration originally issued.</p>

<p>The director may refuse to renew a registration for any of the grounds set out under RCW 19.138.130 and 18.235.130, and where the past conduct of the applicant affords reasonable grounds for belief that the applicant will not carry out the applicant's duties in accordance with law and with integrity and honesty. The director shall promptly notify the applicant in writing by certified mail of its intent to refuse to renew the registration. The registrant may request a hearing on the refusal as provided in RCW 18.235.050. The director may permit the registrant to honor commitments already made to its customers, but no new commitments may be incurred, unless the director is satisfied that all new commitments are completely bonded or secured to ensure that the general public is protected from loss of money paid to the registrant.</p>

<p>A nonresident seller of travel soliciting business or selling travel in the state of Washington, by mail, telephone, or otherwise, either directly or indirectly, is deemed, absent any other appointment, to have appointed the director to be the seller of travel's true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served any legal process against that nonresident arising or growing out of a transaction involving travel services or the sale of travel-related benefits. That solicitation signifies the nonresident's agreement that process against the nonresident that is served as provided in this chapter is of the same legal force and validity as if served personally on the nonresident seller of travel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service of process upon a nonresident seller of travel shall be made by leaving a copy of the process with the director. The fee for the service of process shall be determined by the director by rule. That service is sufficient service upon the nonresident if the plaintiff or plaintiff's attorney of record sends notice of the service and a copy of the process by certified mail before service or immediately after service to the defendant at the address given by the nonresident in a solicitation furnished by the nonresident, and the sender's post office receipt of sending and the plaintiff's or plaintiff's attorney's affidavit of compliance with this section are returned with the process in accordance with Washington superior court civil rules. Notwithstanding the foregoing requirements, however, once service has been made on the director as provided in this section, in the event of failure to comply with the requirement of notice to the nonresident, the court may order that notice be given that will be sufficient to apprise the nonresident.</p>
