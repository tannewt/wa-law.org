<p>Consists of or comprises immoral, deceptive, or scandalous matter; or</p>

<li>
<p>A statement that the applicant believes himself or herself to be the owner of the trademark and believes that no other person has the right to use such trademark in connection with the same or similar goods or services in this state either in the identical form or in such near resemblance thereto as to be likely, when used on or in connection with the goods or services of such other person, to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such additional information or documents as the secretary of state may reasonably require.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>A single application for registration of a trademark may specify all goods or services in a single class or in multiple classes for which the trademark is actually being used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application must be signed by the applicant individual, or by a member of the applicant firm, or by an officer of the applicant corporation, association, union, or other organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application must be accompanied by three specimens or facsimiles of the trademark for each of the goods or services for which its registration is requested, and a filing fee, as set by rule by the secretary of state, payable to the secretary of state.

</li>
<li>
<p>An applicant may correct an application previously filed by the secretary of state, within ninety days of the original filing, if the application contains an incorrect statement or the application was defectively executed, signed, or acknowledged. An application is corrected by filing a form provided by the secretary of state, and accompanied by a filing fee established by the secretary by rule. The correction may not change the mark itself. A corrected application is effective on the effective date of the document it corrects, except that it is effective on the date the correction is filed as to persons relying on the uncorrected document and adversely affected by the correction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An applicant may amend an application previously filed by the secretary of state if the applicant changes the categories in which it does business. An application is amended by filing a form provided by the secretary of state, accompanied by three specimens or facsimiles of the trademark for any new or additional goods or services for which the amendment is requested, and a filing fee established by the secretary by rule. The amendment or correction may not change the mark itself. An amended application is effective on the date it is filed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the secretary of state determines within ninety days of issuance, that a certificate of registration was issued in error, then the secretary may cancel the certificate of registration. The secretary shall promptly notify the registrant of the cancellation in writing. The registrant may petition the superior court of Thurston county for review of the cancellation within sixty days.</p>
