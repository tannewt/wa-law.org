Upon such an election, a joint and one hundred percent survivor option under RCW 2.10.146 shall automatically be given effect as if selected for the benefit of the surviving spouse or dependent who is the designated beneficiary, except that if the judge is not then qualified for a service retirement allowance, the option II benefit shall be based upon the actuarial equivalent of the sum necessary to pay the accrued regular retirement allowance commencing when the deceased judge would have first qualified for a service retirement allowance.
