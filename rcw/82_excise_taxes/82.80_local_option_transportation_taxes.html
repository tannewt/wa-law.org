<p>The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Distributor&quot; means every person who imports, refines, manufactures, produces, or compounds motor vehicle fuel and special fuel as defined in RCW 82.38.020 and sells or distributes the fuel into a county.</p>

<p>Subject to the conditions of this section, any county may levy, by approval of its legislative body and a majority of the registered voters of the county voting on the proposition at a general or special election, additional excise taxes equal to ten percent of the statewide fuel tax rates under RCW 82.38.030 on motor vehicle fuel and special fuel as defined in RCW 82.38.020 sold within the boundaries of the county. Vehicles paying an annual license fee under RCW 82.38.075 are exempt from the county fuel excise tax. An election held under this section must be held not more than twelve months before the date on which the proposed tax is to be levied. The ballot setting forth the proposition must state the tax rate that is proposed. The county's authority to levy additional excise taxes under this section includes the incorporated and unincorporated areas of the county. The additional excise taxes are subject to the same exceptions and rights of refund as applicable to other motor vehicle fuel and special fuel excise taxes levied under chapter 82.38 RCW. The proposed tax may not be levied less than one month from the date the election results are certified by the county election officer. The commencement date for the levy of any tax under this section must be the first day of January, April, July, or October.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The local option motor vehicle fuel tax on motor vehicle fuel and on special fuel is imposed upon the distributor of the fuel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A taxable event for the purposes of this section occurs upon the first distribution of the fuel within the boundaries of a county to a retail outlet, bulk fuel user, or ultimate user of the fuel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All administrative provisions in chapters 82.01, 82.03, and 82.32 RCW, insofar as they are applicable, apply to local option fuel taxes imposed under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before the effective date of the imposition of the fuel taxes under this section, a county must contract with the department of revenue for the administration and collection of the taxes. The contract must provide that a percentage amount, not to exceed one percent of the taxes imposed under this section, will be deposited into the local tax administration account created in the custody of the state treasurer. The department of revenue may spend money from this account, upon appropriation, for the administration of the local taxes imposed under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state treasurer must distribute monthly to the levying county and cities contained therein the proceeds of the additional excise taxes collected under this section, after the deductions for payments and expenditures as provided in RCW 46.68.090(1) (a) and (b) and under the conditions and limitations provided in RCW 82.80.080.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proceeds of the additional excise taxes levied under this section must be used strictly for transportation purposes in accordance with RCW 82.80.070.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A county may not levy the tax under this section if they are levying the tax in RCW 82.80.110 or if they are a member of a regional transportation investment district levying the tax in RCW 82.80.120.</p>

<li>
<p>The proceeds collected pursuant to the exercise of the local option authority of RCW 82.80.010 and 82.80.030 (hereafter called &quot;local option transportation revenues&quot;) shall be used for transportation purposes only, including but not limited to the following: The operation and preservation of roads, streets, and other transportation improvements; new construction, reconstruction, and expansion of city streets, county roads, and state highways and other transportation improvements; development and implementation of public transportation and high capacity transit improvements and programs; and planning, design, and acquisition of right-of-way and sites for such transportation purposes. The proceeds collected from excise taxes on the sale, distribution, or use of motor vehicle fuel and special fuel under RCW 82.80.010 shall be used exclusively for &quot;highway purposes&quot; as that term is construed in Article II, section 40 of the state Constitution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The local option transportation revenues shall be expended for transportation uses consistent with the adopted transportation and land use plans of the jurisdiction expending the funds and consistent with any applicable and adopted regional transportation plan for metropolitan planning areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each local government with a population greater than eight thousand that levies or expends local option transportation funds, is also required to develop and adopt a specific transportation program that contains the following elements:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The program shall identify the geographic boundaries of the entire area or areas within which local option transportation revenues will be levied and expended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The program shall be based on an adopted transportation plan for the geographic areas covered and shall identify the proposed operation and construction of transportation improvements and services in the designated plan area intended to be funded in whole or in part by local option transportation revenues and shall identify the annual costs applicable to the program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The program shall indicate how the local transportation plan is coordinated with applicable transportation plans for the region and for adjacent jurisdictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The program shall include at least a six-year funding plan, updated annually, identifying the specific public and private sources and amounts of revenue necessary to fund the program. The program shall include a proposed schedule for construction of projects and expenditure of revenues. The funding plan shall consider the additional local tax revenue estimated to be generated by new development within the plan area if all or a portion of the additional revenue is proposed to be earmarked as future appropriations for transportation improvements in the program.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local governments with a population greater than eight thousand exercising the authority for local option transportation funds shall periodically review and update their transportation program to ensure that it is consistent with applicable local and regional transportation and land use plans and within the means of estimated public and private revenue available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of expenditure for new or expanded transportation facilities, improvements, and services, priorities in the use of local option transportation revenues shall be identified in the transportation program and expenditures shall be made based upon the following criteria, which are stated in descending order of weight to be attributed:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>First, the project serves a multijurisdictional function;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, it is necessitated by existing or reasonably foreseeable congestion;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third, it has the greatest person-carrying capacity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fourth, it is partially funded by other government funds, such as from the state transportation improvement board, or by private sector contributions, such as those from the local transportation act, chapter 39.92 RCW; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fifth, it meets such other criteria as the local government determines is appropriate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that as a condition of levying, receiving, and expending local option transportation revenues, no local government agency use the revenues to replace, divert, or loan any revenues currently being used for transportation purposes to nontransportation purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local governments are encouraged to enter into interlocal agreements to jointly develop and adopt with other local governments the transportation programs required by this section for the purpose of accomplishing regional transportation planning and development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local governments may use all or a part of the local option transportation revenues for the amortization of local government general obligation and revenue bonds issued for transportation purposes consistent with the requirements of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsections (1) through (8) of this section do not apply to a regional transportation investment district imposing a tax or fee under the local option authority of this chapter. Proceeds collected under the exercise of local option authority under this chapter by a district must be used in accordance with chapter 36.120 RCW.</p>

<li>
<p>Upon approval of a majority of the voters within its boundaries voting on the ballot proposition, a regional transportation investment district may set and impose an annual local option vehicle license fee, or a schedule of fees based upon the age of the vehicle, of up to one hundred dollars per motor vehicle registered within the boundaries of the region on every motor vehicle. As used in this section &quot;motor vehicle&quot; has the meaning provided in RCW 46.04.320, but does not include farm tractors or farm vehicles as defined in RCW 46.04.180 and 46.04.181, off-road vehicles as defined in RCW 46.04.365, nonhighway vehicles as defined in RCW 46.09.310, and snowmobiles as defined in RCW 46.04.546. Vehicles registered under chapter 46.87 RCW and the international registration plan are exempt from the annual local option vehicle license fee set forth in this section. The department of licensing shall administer and collect this fee on behalf of regional transportation investment districts and remit this fee to the custody of the state treasurer for monthly distribution under RCW 82.80.080.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The local option vehicle license fee applies only when renewing a vehicle registration, and is effective upon the registration renewal date as provided by the department of licensing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A regional transportation investment district imposing the local option vehicle license fee or initiating an exemption process shall enter into a contract with the department of licensing. The contract must contain provisions that fully recover the costs to the department of licensing for collection and administration of the fee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A regional transportation investment district imposing the local option fee shall delay the effective date of the local option vehicle license fee imposed by this section at least six months from the date of the final certification of the approval election to allow the department of licensing to implement the administration and collection of or exemption from the fee.</p>

<p>For purposes of dedication to a regional transportation investment district plan under chapter 36.120 RCW, subject to the conditions of this section, a county may levy additional excise taxes equal to ten percent of the statewide fuel tax rates under RCW 82.38.030 on motor vehicle fuel and special fuel as defined in RCW 82.38.020 sold within the boundaries of the county. The additional excise tax is subject to the approval of the county's legislative body and a majority of the registered voters of the county voting on the proposition at a general or special election. An election held under this section must be held not more than twelve months before the date on which the proposed tax is to be levied. The ballot setting forth the proposition must state that the revenues from the tax will be used for a regional transportation investment district plan. The county's authority to levy additional excise taxes under this section includes the incorporated and unincorporated areas of the county. Vehicles paying an annual license fee under RCW 82.38.075 are exempt from the county fuel excise tax. The additional excise taxes are subject to the same exceptions and rights of refund as applicable to other motor vehicle fuel and special fuel excise taxes levied under chapter 82.38 RCW. The proposed tax may not be levied less than one month from the date the election results are certified by the county election officer. The commencement date for the levy of any tax under this section will be the first day of January, April, July, or October.</p>
