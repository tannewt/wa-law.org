## 82.27.010 - Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms have the meanings indicated unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Enhanced food fish" includes all species of food fish, except all species of tuna, mackerel, and jack; shellfish; and anadromous game fish, including by-products and parts thereof, originating within the territorial and adjacent waters of Washington and salmon originating from within the territorial and adjacent waters of Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, and all troll-caught Chinook salmon originating from within the territorial and adjacent waters of southeast Alaska. As used in this subsection, "adjacent" waters of Oregon, Washington, and Alaska are those comprising the United States fish conservation zone; "adjacent" waters of British Columbia are those comprising the Canadian two hundred mile exclusive economic zone; and "southeast Alaska" means that portion of Alaska south and east of Cape Suckling to the Canadian border. For purposes of this chapter, point of origination is established by a document which identifies the product and state or province in which it originates, including, but not limited to fish tickets, bills of lading, invoices, or other documentation required to be kept by governmental agencies.

2. "Commercial" means related to or connected with buying, selling, bartering, or processing.

3. "Possession" means the control of enhanced food fish by the owner and includes both actual and constructive possession. Constructive possession occurs when the person has legal ownership but not actual possession of the enhanced food fish.

4. "Anadromous game fish" means steelhead trout and anadromous cutthroat trout and Dolly Varden char and includes by-products and also parts of anadromous game fish, whether fresh, frozen, canned, or otherwise.

5. "Landed" means the act of physically placing enhanced food fish (a) on a tender in the territorial waters of Washington; or (b) on any land within or without the state of Washington including wharves, piers, or any such extensions therefrom.

## 82.27.020 - Excise tax imposed—Deduction—Measure of tax—Rates—Additional tax imposed.
1. In addition to all other taxes, licenses, or fees provided by law there is established an excise tax on the commercial possession of enhanced food fish as provided in this chapter. The tax is levied upon and shall be collected from the owner of the enhanced food fish whose possession constitutes the taxable event. The taxable event is the first possession in Washington by an owner after the enhanced food fish has been landed. Processing and handling of enhanced food fish by a person who is not the owner is not a taxable event to the processor or handler.

2. A person in possession of enhanced food fish and liable to this tax may deduct from the price paid to the person from which the enhanced food fish (except oysters) are purchased an amount equal to a tax at one-half the rate levied in this section upon these products.

3. The measure of the tax is the value of the enhanced food fish at the point of landing.

4. The tax shall be equal to the measure of the tax multiplied by the rates for enhanced food fish as follows:

   a. Puget Sound Chinook, coho, and chum salmon and anadromous game fish: Five and twenty-five one-hundredths percent;

   b. Ocean waters, Columbia river, Willapa Bay, and Grays Harbor Chinook, coho, and chum salmon and anadromous game fish: Six and twenty-five one-hundredths percent;

   c. Pink and sockeye salmon: Three and fifteen one-hundredths percent;

   d. Other food fish and shellfish, except oysters, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers: Two and one-tenth percent;

   e. Oysters: Eight one-hundredths of one percent;

   f. Sea urchins: Two and one-tenth percent; and

   g. Sea cucumbers: Two and one-tenth percent.

5. An additional tax is imposed equal to the rate specified in RCW 82.02.030 multiplied by the tax payable under subsection (4) of this section.
