<p>The legislature finds that high-wage, high-skilled jobs are vital to the economic health of the state's citizens, and that targeted tax incentives will encourage the formation of high-wage, high-skilled jobs. The legislature also finds that tax incentives should be subject to the same rigorous requirements for efficiency and accountability as are other expenditure programs, and that tax incentives should therefore be focused to provide the greatest possible return on the state's investment.</p>
<p>The legislature also finds that high-technology businesses are a vital and growing source of high-wage, high-skilled jobs in this state, and that the high-technology sector is a key component of the state's effort to encourage economic diversification. However, the legislature finds that many high-technology businesses incur significant costs associated with research and development and pilot scale manufacturing many years before a marketable product can be produced, and that current state tax policy discourages the growth of these companies by taxing them long before they become profitable.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that stimulating growth of high-technology businesses early in their development cycle, when they are turning ideas into marketable products, will build upon the state's established high-technology base, creating additional research and development jobs and subsequent manufacturing facilities.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the legislature hereby establishes a program of business and occupation tax credits for qualified research and development expenditures. The legislature also hereby establishes a tax deferral program for high-technology research and development and pilot scale manufacturing facilities. The legislature declares that these limited programs serve the vital public purposes of incenting expenditures in research and development, supporting, and sustaining as they develop new technologies and products, and creating quality employment opportunities in this state. The legislature further declares its intent to create a contract within the meaning of Article I, section 23 of the state Constitution as to those businesses that make capital investments in consideration of the tax deferral program established in this chapter.</p>

<p>All buildings included in a final election to treat multiple qualified buildings as a single investment project must have been issued a temporary certificate of occupancy or its equivalent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before the final election is made, the lessee may remove one or more of the qualified buildings included in the preliminary election from the investment project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a qualified building for which a preliminary election has been made under subsection (1) of this section is, for any reason, not included in a final election to treat the multiple qualified buildings as a single investment project, the qualified building will be treated as an individual investment project under the original application for that building.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a final election is made not to treat the multiple qualified buildings as a single investment project or a final election is not made by the deadline in (a) of this subsection, the qualified buildings will each be treated as individual investment projects under the original applications for those buildings.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a final election is made to treat multiple qualified buildings as a single investment project, the department must review the investment project to determine whether to certify the investment project as being operationally complete. If the department certifies that an investment project is operationally complete, the certification is deemed to have occurred in the calendar year in which the final election is made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may not certify as operationally complete an investment project consisting of multiple qualifying buildings unless the lessee furnishes the department with a bond, letter of credit, or other security acceptable to the department in an amount equal to the repayment obligation as determined by the department. The department may decrease the secured amount each year as the repayment obligation decreases under the provisions of RCW 82.63.045. If the lessee does not furnish the department with a bond, letter of credit, or other security acceptable to the department equal to the amount of deferred tax, the qualified buildings will each be treated as individual investment projects under the original applications for those buildings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The preliminary election and final election must be made in a form and manner prescribed by the department.</p>
</li>
