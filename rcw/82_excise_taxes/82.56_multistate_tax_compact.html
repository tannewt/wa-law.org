This election for any tax year may be made in all party states or subdivisions thereof or in any one or more of the party states or subdivisions thereof without reference to the election made in the others. For the purposes of this paragraph, taxes imposed by subdivisions shall be considered separately from state taxes and the apportionment and allocation also may be applied to the entire tax base.

The multistate tax commission, not more than once in five years, may adjust the $100,000 figure in order to reflect such changes as may occur in the real value of the dollar, and such adjusted figure, upon adoption by the commission, shall replace the $100,000 figure specifically provided herein. Each party state and subdivision thereof may make the same election available to taxpayers additional to those specified in this paragraph.</li>

If a taxpayer has income from business activity as a public utility but derives the greater percentage of his income from activities subject to this article, the taxpayer may elect to allocate and apportion his entire net income as provided in this article.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of allocation and apportionment of income under this article, a taxpayer is taxable in another state if (1) in that state he is subject to a net income tax, a franchise tax measured by net income, a franchise tax for the privilege of doing business, or a corporate stock tax, or (2) that state has jurisdiction to subject the taxpayer to a net income tax regardless of whether, in fact, the state does or does not.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>5.(a) Net rents and royalties from real property located in this state are allocable to this state.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The extent of utilization of tangible personal property in a state is determined by multiplying the rents and royalties by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days of physical location of the property in the state during the rental or royalty period in the taxable year and the denominator of which is the number of days of physical location of the property everywhere during all rental or royalty periods in the taxable year. If the physical location of the property during the rental or royalty period is unknown or unascertainable by the taxpayer, tangible personal property is utilized in the state in which the property was located at the time the rental or royalty payer obtained possession.</p>

<li>
<p>A patent is utilized in a state to the extent that it is employed in production, fabrication, manufacturing, or other processing in the state or to the extent that a patented product is produced in the state. If the basis of receipts from patent royalties does not permit allocation to states or if the accounting procedures do not reflect states of utilization, the patent is utilized in the state in which the taxpayer's commercial domicile is located.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A copyright is utilized in a state to the extent that printing or other publication originates in the state. If the basis of receipts from copyright royalties does not permit allocation to states or if the accounting procedures do not reflect states of utilization, the copyright is utilized in the state in which the taxpayer's commercial domicile is located.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</li>
<li>
<p>The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount paid in this state during the tax period by the taxpayer for compensation and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid everywhere during the tax period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compensation is paid in this state if:</p>

<li>
<p>The income-producing activity is performed in this state; or</p>
</li>
<li>

<ol>
<li>Each purchaser liable for a use tax on tangible personal property shall be entitled to full credit for the combined amount or amounts of legally imposed sales or use taxes paid by him with respect to the same property to another state and any subdivision thereof.

<li>
<p>The commission may decline to perform any audit requested if it finds that its available personnel or other resources are insufficient for the purpose or that, in the terms requested, the audit is impracticable of satisfactory performance. If the commission, on the basis of its experience, has reason to believe that an audit of a particular taxpayer, either at a particular time or on a particular schedule, would be of interest to a number of party states or their subdivisions, it may offer to make the audit or audits, the offer to be contingent on sufficient participation therein as determined by the commission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information obtained by any audit pursuant to this article shall be confidential and available only for tax purposes to party states, their subdivisions or the United States. Availability of information shall be in accordance with the laws of the states or subdivisions on whose account the commission performs the audit, and only through the appropriate agencies or officers of such states or subdivisions. Nothing in this article shall be construed to require any taxpayer to keep records for any period not otherwise required by law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other arrangements made or authorized pursuant to law for cooperative audit by or on behalf of the party states or any of their subdivisions are not superseded or invalidated by this article.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In no event shall the commission make any charge against a taxpayer for an audit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As used in this article, &quot;tax,&quot; in addition to the meaning ascribed to it in Article II, means any tax or license fee imposed in whole or in part for revenue purposes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Article IX. Arbitration.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Whenever the commission finds a need for settling disputes concerning apportionments and allocations by arbitration, it may adopt a regulation placing this article in effect, notwithstanding the provisions of Article VII.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall select and maintain an arbitration panel composed of officers and employees of state and local governments and private persons who shall be knowledgeable and experienced in matters of tax law and administration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever a taxpayer who has elected to employ Article IV, or whenever the laws of the party state or subdivision thereof are substantially identical with the relevant provisions of Article IV, the taxpayer, by written notice to the commission and to each party state or subdivision thereof that would be affected, may secure arbitration of an apportionment or allocation, if he is dissatisfied with the final administrative determination of the tax agency of the state or subdivision with respect thereto on the ground that it would subject him to double or multiple taxation by two or more party states or subdivisions thereof. Each party state and subdivision thereof hereby consents to the arbitration as provided herein, and agrees to be bound thereby.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The arbitration board shall be composed of one person selected by the taxpayer, one by the agency or agencies involved, and one member of the commission's arbitration panel. If the agencies involved are unable to agree on the person to be selected by them, such person shall be selected by lot from the total membership of the arbitration panel. The two persons selected for the board in the manner provided by the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall jointly select the third member of the board. If they are unable to agree on the selection, the third member shall be selected by lot from among the total membership of the arbitration panel. No member of a board selected by lot shall be qualified to serve if he is an officer or employee or is otherwise affiliated with any party to the arbitration proceeding. Residence within the jurisdiction of a party to the arbitration proceeding shall not constitute affiliation within the meaning of this paragraph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board may sit in any state or subdivision party to the proceeding, in the state of the taxpayer's incorporation, residence or domicile, in any state where the taxpayer does business, or in any place that it finds most appropriate for gaining access to evidence relevant to the matter before it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board shall give due notice of the times and places of its hearings. The parties shall be entitled to be heard, to present evidence, and to examine and cross-examine witnesses. The board shall act by majority vote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board shall have power to administer oaths, take testimony, subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of accounts, books, papers, records, and other documents, and issue commissions to take testimony. Subpoenas may be signed by any member of the board. In case of failure to obey a subpoena, and upon application by the board, any judge of a court of competent jurisdiction of the state in which the board is sitting or in which the person to whom the subpoena is directed may be found may make an order requiring compliance with the subpoena, and the court may punish failure to obey the order as a contempt. The provisions of this paragraph apply only in states that have adopted this article.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless the parties otherwise agree the expenses and other costs of the arbitration shall be assessed and allocated among the parties by the board in such manner as it may determine. The commission shall fix a schedule of compensation for members of arbitration boards and of other allowable expenses and costs. No officer or employee of a state or local government who serves as a member of a board shall be entitled to compensation therefor unless he is required on account of his service to forego the regular compensation attaching to his public employment, but any such board member shall be entitled to expenses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board shall determine the disputed apportionment or allocation and any matters necessary thereto. The determinations of the board shall be final for purposes of making the apportionment or allocation, but for no other purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board shall file with the commission and with each tax agency represented in the proceeding: the determination of the board; the board's written statement of its reasons therefor; the record of the board's proceedings; and any other documents required by the arbitration rules of the commission to be filed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall publish the determinations of boards together with the statements of the reasons therefor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall adopt and publish rules of procedure and practice and shall file a copy of such rules and of any amendment thereto with the appropriate agency or officer in each of the party states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing contained herein shall prevent at any time a written compromise of any matter or matters in dispute, if otherwise lawful, by the parties to the arbitration proceeding.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Article X. Entry into Force</p>
<p>and Withdrawal.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This compact shall enter into force when enacted into law by any seven states. Thereafter, this compact shall become effective as to any other state upon its enactment thereof. The commission shall arrange for notification of all party states whenever there is a new enactment of the compact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same. No withdrawal shall affect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party state prior to the time of such withdrawal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No proceeding commenced before an arbitration board prior to the withdrawal of a state and to which the withdrawing state or any subdivision thereof is a party shall be discontinued or terminated by the withdrawal, nor shall the board thereby lose jurisdiction over any of the parties to the proceeding necessary to make a binding determination therein.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Article XI. Effect on Other Laws</p>
<p>and Jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Nothing in this compact shall be construed to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Affect the power of any state or subdivision thereof to fix rates of taxation, except that a party state shall be obligated to implement Article III 2 of this compact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply to any tax or fixed fee imposed for the registration of a motor vehicle or any tax on motor fuel, other than a sales tax: PROVIDED, That the definition of &quot;tax&quot; in Article VIII 9 may apply for the purposes of that article and the commission's powers of study and recommendation pursuant to Article VI 3 may apply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Withdraw or limit the jurisdiction of any state or local court or administrative officer or body with respect to any person, corporation or other entity or subject matter, except to the extent that such jurisdiction is expressly conferred by or pursuant to this compact upon another agency or body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supersede or limit the jurisdiction of any court of the United States.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Article XII. Construction and Severability.</p>
<p>This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the Constitution of any state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the Constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.</p>
