<p>The legislature finds that there are several areas in the state that are characterized by very high levels of unemployment and poverty. The legislature further finds that economic stagnation is the primary cause of this high unemployment rate and poverty; that new state policies are necessary in order to promote economic stimulation and new employment opportunities in these distressed areas; and that policies providing incentives for economic growth in these distressed areas are essential. For these reasons, the legislature reestablishes a tax deferral program to be effective solely in distressed counties. The legislature declares that this limited program serves the vital public purpose of creating employment opportunities and reducing poverty in the distressed counties of the state.</p>

<p>Each recipient of a deferral of taxes granted under this chapter must file a complete annual tax performance report with the department under RCW 82.32.534. If the economic benefits of the deferral are passed to a lessee as provided in RCW 82.60.025, the lessee must file a complete annual tax performance report, and the applicant is not required to file a complete annual tax performance report.</p>

<li>
<p>The department must use the information reported on the annual tax performance report required by this section to study the tax deferral program authorized under this chapter.
