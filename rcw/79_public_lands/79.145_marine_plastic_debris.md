## 79.145.010 - Intent.
The legislature finds that the public health and safety is threatened by an increase in the amount of plastic garbage being deposited in the waters and on the shores of the state. To address this growing problem, the commissioner appointed the marine plastic debris task force which presented a state action plan in October 1988. It is necessary for the state of Washington to implement the action plan in order to:

1. Cleanup and prevent further pollution of the state's waters and aquatic lands;

2. Increase public awareness;

3. Coordinate federal, state, local, and private efforts;

4. Foster the stewardship of the aquatic lands of the state.
