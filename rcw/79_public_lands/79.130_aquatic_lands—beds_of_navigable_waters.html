<p>The legislature recognizes the importance of economic development in the state of Washington, and finds that the location of a United States Navy base in Everett, Washington will enhance economic development. The legislature finds that the state should not assume liability or risks resulting from any action taken by the United States Navy, now or in the future associated with the dredge disposal program for that project known as confined aquatic disposal (CAD). The legislature also recognizes the importance of improving water quality and cleaning up pollution in Puget Sound. The legislature declares these actions to be a public purpose necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens, and to promote economic growth and improve environmental quality in the state of Washington. The United States Navy proposes to commence the Everett home port project immediately.</p>

<li>
<p>Upon application by the United States Navy, and upon verification of the legal description and compliance with the intent of this chapter, the commissioner is authorized to lease bedlands in Port Gardner Bay for a term of thirty years so the United States Navy can utilize a dredge spoil site solely for purposes related to construction of the United States Navy base at Everett.</p>
