<p>The legislature finds that: (1) There is an increasing and continuing need by the people of Washington for certain areas of the state to be conserved, in rural as well as urban settings, for the benefit of present and future generations; (2) such areas are worthy of conservation for their outstanding scenic and ecological values and provide opportunities for low-impact public use; (3) in certain cases acquisition of property or rights in property is necessary to protect these areas for public purposes; and (4) there is a need for a state agency to act in an effective and timely manner to acquire interests in such areas and to develop appropriate management strategies for conservation purposes.</p>
