<p>Any applicant to purchase, or lease, any public lands of the state, or any valuable materials thereon, and any person whose property rights or interests will be affected by such sale or lease, feeling aggrieved by any order or decision of the board, or the commissioner, concerning the same, may appeal therefrom to the superior court of the county in which such lands or materials are situated, by serving upon all parties who have appeared in the proceedings in which the order or decision was made, or their attorneys, a written notice of appeal, and filing such notice, with proof, or admission, of service, with the board, or the commissioner, within thirty days from the date of the order or decision appealed from, and at the time of filing the notice, or within five days thereafter, filing a bond to the state, in the penal sum of two hundred dollars, with sufficient sureties, to be approved by the secretary of the board, or the commissioner, conditioned that the appellant shall pay all costs that may be awarded against the appellant on appeal, or the dismissal thereof. Within thirty days after the filing of notice of appeal, the secretary of the board, or the commissioner, shall certify, under official seal, a transcript of all entries in the records of the board, or the commissioner, together with all processes, pleadings and other papers relating to and on file in the case, except evidence used in such proceedings, and file such transcript and papers, at the expense of the applicant, with the clerk of the court to which the appeal is taken.

Costs on appeal shall be awarded to the prevailing party as in actions commenced in the superior court, but no costs shall be awarded against the state, the board, or the commissioner. Should judgment be rendered against the appellant, the costs shall be taxed against the appellant and the appellant's sureties on the appeal bond, except when the state is the only adverse party, and shall be included in the judgment, upon which execution may issue as in other cases. Any party feeling aggrieved by the judgment of the superior court may seek appellate review as in other civil cases. Unless appellate review of the judgment of the superior court is sought, the clerk of said court shall, on demand, certify, under the clerk's hand and the seal of the court, a true copy of the judgment, to the board, or the commissioner, which judgment shall thereupon have the same force and effect as if rendered by the board, or the commissioner. In all cases of appeals from orders or decisions of the commissioner involving the prior right to purchase tidelands of the first class, if the appeal is not prosecuted, heard and determined, within two years from the date of the appeal, the attorney general shall, after thirty days' notice to the appellant of the attorney general's intention so to do, move the court for a dismissal of the appeal, but nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the dismissal of such appeal at any time in the manner provided by law.</p>

<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the state's community and technical colleges need a dedicated source of revenue to augment other sources of capital improvement funding. The intent of this section is to ensure that the forestland purchased under section 310, chapter 16, Laws of 1990 1st ex. sess. and known as the community and technical college forest reserve land base, is managed in perpetuity and in the same manner as state forestlands for sustainable commercial forestry and multiple use of lands consistent with RCW 79.10.120. These lands will also be managed to provide an outdoor education and experience area for organized groups. The lands will provide a source of revenue for the long-term capital improvement needs of the state community and technical college system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There has been increasing pressure to convert forestlands within areas of the state subject to population growth. Loss of forestland in urbanizing areas reduces the production of forest products and the available supply of open space, watershed protection, habitat, and recreational opportunities. The land known as the community and technical college forest reserve land base is forever reserved from sale. However, the timber and other products on the land may be sold, or the land may be leased in the same manner and for the same purposes as authorized for state granted lands if the department finds the sale or lease to be in the best interest of this forest reserve land base and approves the terms and conditions of the sale or lease.</p>

<li>
<p>By June 30, 2019, the department must exchange land within the community and technical college forest reserve for land of equal value held for the benefit of charitable, educational, penal, and reformatory institutions that is currently leased to certain community and technical colleges under section 1, chapter 168, Laws of 1985 and section 1, chapter 198, Laws of 2004. The department must transfer the community and technical college forest reserve land that the department acquires in the exchange out of the community and technical college forest reserve, and the department must transfer ownership of that land to the state board for community and technical colleges to be managed for educational purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Up to twenty-five percent of the revenue from these lands, as determined by the board, will be deposited in the forest development account to reimburse the forest development account for expenditures from the account for management of these lands.</p>
