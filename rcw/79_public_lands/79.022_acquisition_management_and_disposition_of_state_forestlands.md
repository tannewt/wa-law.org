Such agreement shall provide for the price and manner of such reacquisition. The board is authorized to provide in such agreement for the advance of funds available to it for such purpose from the forest development account, all or any part of the price for such reacquisition so agreed upon, which advance shall be repaid at such time and in such manner as provided in the agreement, solely from any distribution to be made to said county under the provisions of RCW 79.22.040; that the title to said lands shall be retained by the state free from any trust until the state shall have been fully reimbursed for all funds advanced in connection with such reacquisition; and that in the event of the failure of the county to repay such advance in the manner provided, the said forestlands shall be retained by the state to be administered and/or disposed of in the same manner as other state forestlands free and clear of any trust interest therein by said county. Such county shall make provisions for the reimbursement of the various funds from any moneys derived from such lands so acquired, or any other county trust forest board lands which are distributable in a like manner, for any sums withheld from funds for other areas which would have been distributed thereto from time to time but for such agreement.

## 79.22.140 - State forestland pool—Authorization—Participation.
1. The board may create a state forestland pool, to be managed in accordance with this section, if the board determines that creation of a land pool is in the best interest of the state or affected trust, based on an analysis prepared by the department under RCW 79.22.150. The land pool may not contain more than ten thousand acres of state forestland at any one time.

2. A county is eligible to participate in a land pool if the board determines it:

    a.  Has a population of twenty-five thousand or less; and

    b.  Has existing state forestlands encumbered with timber harvest deferrals, associated with wildlife species listed under the federal endangered species act, more than thirty years in length.

3. All lands in the land pool are state forestlands and must be managed in the same manner and with the same responsibilities as other state forestlands. Proceeds from the state forestland pool must, except as provided in RCW 79.64.110, be distributed under RCW 79.22.010 and 79.22.040.

4. [Empty]

    a.  A county may participate in the land pool only if it is eligible, as determined under subsection (2) of this section, and the board receives a written request to do so by the legislative authority of that county.

    b.  The board shall end any further participation of a county in the land pool if it receives a written request to do so by the legislative authority of that county. If the board receives such a request, that county's interest in the land pool as a beneficiary remains, but no new contributions of asset value may be made to the land pool on behalf of the county and no new lands may be purchased in that county for the land pool.

5. [Empty]

    a.  If a land pool is created by the board, the department and the participating counties must develop a funding strategy for acquiring land to include in the land pool.

    b.  The department and participating counties may pursue funding for the transfer of state forestland encumbered by long-term wildlife-related harvest deferrals within the participating counties into status as a natural resources conservation area under chapter 79.71 RCW, and use the value of the transferred land to acquire working forestlands to include in the land pool.

    c.  The department and participating counties may pursue other land acquisition funding strategies.

## 79.22.150 - State forestland pool—Analysis.
1. Upon the request of the board in its consideration of creating a state forestland pool under RCW 79.22.140, the department must conduct an analysis that includes, at a minimum, the following elements:

    a.  An evaluation of how the proposed land pool would benefit the requesting counties, including revenue predictability and long-term revenue projections;

    b.  The development and proposal of a set of policy, administrative, and financial structures necessary for the department to establish the land pool, including a method to determine the percentage of revenue to be distributed to each county participating in the land pool that is based on each county's proportionate contribution of asset value to the land pool;

    c.  An estimation of the administrative costs of creating and maintaining the land pool; and

    d.  Any additional information requested by the board.

2. The department may coordinate its analysis with affected counties or an association representing the affected counties.

## 79.22.300 - Procedure—Reconveyance back when use ceases.
Whenever the board of county commissioners of any county shall determine that state forestlands, that were acquired from such county by the state pursuant to RCW 79.22.040 and that are under the administration of the department, are needed by the county for public park use in accordance with the county and the state outdoor recreation plans, the board of county commissioners may file an application with the board for the transfer of such state forestlands.

Upon the filing of an application by the board of county commissioners, the department shall cause notice of the impending transfer to be given in the manner provided by RCW 42.30.060. If the department determines that the proposed use is in accordance with the state outdoor recreation plan, it shall reconvey said state forestlands to the requesting county to have and to hold for so long as the state forestlands are developed, maintained, and used for the proposed public park purpose. This reconveyance may contain conditions to allow the department to coordinate the management of any adjacent public lands with the proposed park activity to encourage maximum multiple use management and may reserve rights-of-way needed to manage other public lands in the area. The application shall be denied if the department finds that the proposed use is not in accord with the state outdoor recreation plan. If the land is not, or ceases to be, used for public park purposes the land shall be conveyed back to the department upon request of the department.
