<p>The state of Washington finds that to realize the state's current statutory policy of regulating health professions at the least restrictive level consistent with the public interest, a program of licensure for denturists should be established. The intent of the legislature is to help assure the public's health, provide a mechanism for consumer protection, and offer cost-effective alternatives for denture care services and products to individual consumers and the state.</p>
