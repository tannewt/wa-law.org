</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding subsection (1) of Article IX, the board shall review the rules of the commission. The board may reject or approve and adopt the rules of the commission as rules of the board. The state of Washington is subject to a rule of the commission only if the rule of the commission is adopted by the board and the rule does not violate any right guaranteed by the state Constitution or the United States Constitution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact within four years of the date of adoption of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any member state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rules or amendments to the rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the commission, and at least thirty days in advance of the meeting at which the rule will be considered and voted upon, the commission shall file a notice of proposed rule making:</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a hearing is held on the proposed rule or amendment, the commission shall publish the place, time, and date of the scheduled public hearing. If the hearing is held via electronic means, the commission shall publish the mechanism for access to the electronic hearing.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording will be made available on request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this Article IX shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this Article IX.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business on the scheduled hearing date if the hearing was not held, the commission shall consider all written and oral comments received.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If no written notice of intent to attend the public hearing by interested parties is received, the commission may proceed with promulgation of the proposed rule without a public hearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based on the rule-making record and the full text of the rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity for comment, or hearing, provided that the usual rule-making procedures provided in the compact and in this Article IX shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety days after the effective date of the rule.

<p>The commission or an authorized committee of the commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule or amendment for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing, and delivered to the chair of the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Oversight.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent. The provisions of this compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the commission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Default, technical assistance, and termination.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and/or any other action to be taken by the commission; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state.</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dispute resolution.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among member states and between member and nonmember states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enforcement.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices against a member state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

</li>
<li>
<p>Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until six months after enactment of the repealing statute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state's physical therapy licensing board to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any physical therapy licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XII - CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY</p>
<p>This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof.
