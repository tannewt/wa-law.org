<p>The board of county commissioners of each county shall be ex officio, by virtue of their office, supervisors of the zones created in each county. In any zone with more than two thousand residents, an election of supervisors other than the board of county commissioners may be held as provided in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When proposed by citizen petition or by resolution of the board of county commissioners, a ballot proposition authorizing election of the supervisors of a zone shall be submitted by ordinance to the voters residing in the zone at any general election, or at any special election which may be called for that purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ballot proposition shall be submitted (a) if the board of county supervisors enacts an ordinance submitting the proposition after adopting a resolution proposing the election of supervisors of a zone; or (b) if a petition proposing the election of supervisors of a zone is submitted to the county auditor of the county in which the zone is located that is signed by registered voters within the zone, numbering at least fifteen percent of the votes cast in the last county general election by registered voters within the zone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon receipt of a citizen petition under subsection (3)(b) of this section, the county auditor shall determine whether the petition is signed by a sufficient number of registered voters, using the registration records and returns of the preceding general election, and, no later than forty-five days after receipt of the petition, shall attach to the petition the auditor's certificate stating whether or not sufficient signatures have been obtained. If the signatures are found by the auditor to be insufficient, the petition shall be returned to the person filing it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ballot proposition authorizing election of supervisors of zones shall appear on the ballot of the next general election or at the next special election date specified under RCW 29A.04.330 occurring sixty or more days after the last resolution proposing election of supervisors or the date the county auditor certifies that the petition proposing such election contains sufficient valid signatures.</p>

<p>□ &quot;Against the direct election of flood control zone district supervisors.&quot;</p>

<li>
<p>The ordinance or petition submitting the ballot proposition shall designate the proposed composition of the supervisors of zones, which shall be clearly described in the ballot proposition. The ballot proposition shall state that the zone supervisors shall thereafter be selected by election, and, at the same election at which the proposition is submitted to the voters as to whether to elect zone supervisors, three zone supervisors shall be elected. The election of zone supervisors is null and void if the voters, by a simple majority, do not approve the direct election of the zone supervisors. Candidates shall run for specific supervisor positions. No primary may be held to nominate candidates. The person receiving the greatest number of votes for each position shall be elected as a supervisor. The staggering of the terms of office shall occur as follows: (a) The person who is elected receiving the greatest number of votes shall be elected to a six-year term of office if the election is held in an odd-numbered year or a five-year term of office if the election is held in an even-numbered year; (b) the person who is elected receiving the second greatest number of votes shall be elected to a four-year term of office if the election is held in an odd-numbered year or a three-year term of office if the election is held in an even-numbered year; and (c) the other person who is elected shall be elected to a two-year term of office if the election is held in an odd-numbered year or a one-year term of office if the election is held in an even-numbered year. The initial supervisors shall take office immediately when they are elected and qualified, and for purposes of computing their terms of office the terms shall be assumed to commence on the first day of January in the year after they are elected. Thereafter, all supervisors shall be elected to six-year terms of office. All supervisors shall serve until their respective successors are elected and qualified and assume office in accordance with RCW 29A.60.280. Vacancies may occur and shall be filled as provided in chapter 42.12 RCW.</p>

The compensation for supervisors in office on January 1, 2015, is fixed at one hundred fourteen dollars per day. The board of county commissioners shall fix any such compensation to be paid to the initial supervisors during their initial terms of office. The supervisors shall fix the compensation to be paid to the supervisors thereafter. Compensation for the supervisors shall not exceed ten thousand nine hundred forty-four dollars in one calendar year.</p>

<p>A supervisor is entitled to reimbursement for reasonable expenses actually incurred in connection with performance of the duties of a supervisor, including subsistence and lodging, while away from the supervisor's place of residence, and mileage for use of a privately owned vehicle in accordance with chapter 42.24 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any supervisor may waive all or any portion of his or her compensation payable under this section as to any month or months during his or her term of office, by a written waiver filed with the supervisors as provided in this section. The waiver, to be effective, must be filed any time after the member's election and prior to the date on which the compensation would otherwise be paid. The waiver shall specify the month or period of months for which it is made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dollar thresholds established in this section must be adjusted for inflation by the office of financial management every five years, beginning January 1, 2024, based upon changes in the consumer price index during that time period. &quot;Consumer price index&quot; means, for any calendar year, that year's annual average consumer price index, for Washington state, for wage earners and clerical workers, all items, compiled by the bureau of labor and statistics, United States department of labor. If the bureau of labor and statistics develops more than one consumer price index for areas within the state, the index covering the greatest number of people, covering areas exclusively within the boundaries of the state and including all items, must be used for the adjustments of inflation in this section. The office of financial management must calculate the new dollar threshold and transmit it to the office of the code reviser for publication in the Washington State Register at least one month before the new dollar threshold is to take effect.</p>
