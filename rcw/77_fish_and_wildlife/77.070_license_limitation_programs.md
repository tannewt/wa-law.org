## 77.70.200 - Herring spawn on kelp fishery licenses—Number limited.
The legislature finds that the wise management of Washington state's herring resource is of paramount importance to the people of the state. The legislature finds that herring are an important part of the food chain for a number of the state's living marine resources. The legislature finds that both open and closed pond "spawn on kelp" harvesting techniques allow for an economic return to the state while at the same time providing for the proper management of the herring resource. The legislature finds that limitations on the number of herring harvesters tends to improve the management and economic health of the herring industry. The maximum number of herring spawn on kelp fishery licenses shall not exceed five annually. The state therefore must use its authority to regulate the number of herring spawn on kelp fishery licenses so that the management and economic health of the herring fishery may be improved.

The holder of a geoduck fishery license and the holder's agents and representatives shall comply with all applicable commercial diving safety regulations adopted by the federal occupational safety and health administration established under the federal occupational safety and health act of 1970 as such law exists on May 8, 1979, 84 Stat. 1590 et seq.; 29 U.S.C. Sec. 651 et seq. A violation of those regulations is a violation of this subsection. For the purposes of this section, persons who dive for geoducks are "employees" as defined by the federal occupational safety and health act. A violation of this subsection is grounds for suspension or revocation of a geoduck fishery license following a hearing under the procedures of chapter 34.05 RCW. The director shall not suspend or revoke a geoduck fishery license if the violation has been corrected within ten days of the date the license holder receives written notice of the violation. If there is a substantial probability that a violation of the commercial diving standards could result in death or serious physical harm to a person engaged in harvesting geoduck clams, the director shall suspend the license immediately until the violation has been corrected. If the license holder is not the operator of the harvest vessel and has contracted with another person for the harvesting of geoducks, the director shall not suspend or revoke the license if the license holder terminates its business relationship with that person until compliance with this subsection is secured.

7. A person using a vessel in the geoduck fishery is required to apply for and obtain a vessel identification number from the department. The application fee for the vessel identification number is one hundred five dollars.

However, if such vessel designation is the result of an emergency transfer, the applicable vessel length would be the most recent permanent vessel designation on the license prior to June 7, 2006;

    b.  If the hull length of the vessel proposed to be designated is comparable to or exceeds by up to one foot the hull length of the currently designated vessel, the department may change the vessel designation no more than once in any one-year period, measured from September 15th to September 15th of the following year, unless the currently designated vessel is lost or in disrepair such that it does not safely operate, in which case the department may allow a change in vessel designation;

    c.  If the hull length of the vessel proposed to be designated exceeds by between one and ten feet the hull length of the designated vessel on June 7, 2006, the department may change the vessel designation no more than once on or after June 7, 2006, unless a request is made by the license holder during a Washington state coastal crab season for an emergency change in vessel designation. If such an emergency request is made, the director may allow a temporary change in designation to another vessel, if the hull length of the other vessel does not exceed by more than ten feet the hull length of the currently designated vessel.

## 77.70.390 - Reduction of landing requirements under RCW  77.70.280—Procedure.
The director may reduce the landing requirements established under RCW 77.70.280 upon the recommendation of an advisory review board established under *RCW 77.70.030, but the director may not entirely waive the landing requirement. The advisory review board may recommend a reduction of the landing requirement in individual cases if in the advisory review board's judgment, extenuating circumstances prevented achievement of the landing requirement. The director shall adopt rules governing the operation of the advisory review board and defining "extenuating circumstances." Extenuating circumstances may include situations in which a person had a vessel under construction such that qualifying landings could not be made. In defining extenuating circumstances, special consideration shall be given to individuals who can provide evidence of lack of access to capital based on past discrimination due to race, creed, color, sex, national origin, or disability.

5. Beginning 2012, a Washington-coastal spot shrimp pot fishery license holder is prohibited from designating, on the Washington-coastal spot shrimp pot fishery license:

    a.  A vessel whose surveyed length overall is more than ten feet longer than the surveyed length overall of the vessel designated on the licensee's coastal spot shrimp experimental emerging commercial fishery license as of March 31, 2003; and

    b.  A vessel whose surveyed length overall exceeds ninety feet.

6. In the event the Washington-coastal spot shrimp pot fishery license is transferred by sale, lease, inheritance, or lottery, and pursuant to subsection (4) of this section, the vessel length restriction associated with that license must remain attached to the license.

7. A natural person may not own or hold an ownership interest in more than one Washington-coastal spot shrimp pot fishery license at a time.

8. Only a person who owns or is designated as an operator of the vessel designated on the license may hold a Washington-coastal spot shrimp pot fishery license.

9. Nothing in this section:

    a.  Requires the commission to open a commercial coastal spot shrimp fishery in any given year;

    b.  Prohibits the commission from closing or limiting an opened commercial coastal spot shrimp fishery for any reason; or

    c.  Confers any right of compensation to the holder of a Washington-coastal spot shrimp pot fishery license if the license is revoked, limited, or modified by the legislature.

10. Issuance of a Washington-coastal spot shrimp pot fishery license does not create, and may not be construed to create, any right, title, or interest in the coastal spot shrimp resource.

11. The legislature recognizes that Washington-coastal spot shrimp pot fishery licenses may be revoked by future legislatures if the fishery is found to have jeopardized the sustainability of the coastal spot shrimp resource or the marine ecosystem.
