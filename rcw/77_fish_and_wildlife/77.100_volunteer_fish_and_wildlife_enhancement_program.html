<p>The fish and wildlife resources of the state benefit by the contribution of volunteer recreational and commercial fishing organizations, schools, and other volunteer groups in cooperative projects under agreement with the department. These projects provide educational opportunities, improve the communication between the natural resources agencies and the public, and increase the fish and game resources of the state. In an effort to increase these benefits and realize the full potential of cooperative projects, the department shall administer a cooperative fish and wildlife enhancement program and enter agreements with volunteer groups relating to the operation of cooperative projects.</p>

<p>The department shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Encourage and support the establishment of cooperative agreements for the development and operation of cooperative food fish, shellfish, game fish, game bird, game animal, and nongame wildlife projects, and projects which provide an opportunity for volunteer groups to become involved in resource and habitat-oriented activities. All cooperative projects shall be fairly considered in the approval of cooperative agreements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify regions and species or activities that would be particularly suitable for cooperative projects providing benefits compatible with department goals;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine the availability of rearing space at operating facilities or of net pens, egg boxes, portable rearing containers, incubators, and any other rearing facilities for use in cooperative projects, and allocate them to volunteer groups as fairly as possible;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make viable eggs available for replenishing fish runs, and salmon carcasses for nutrient enhancement of streams. If a regional fisheries enhancement group, lead entity, volunteer cooperative group, federally approved tribe in Washington, or a governmental hatchery in Washington, Oregon, or Idaho requests the department for viable eggs, the department must include the request within the brood stock document prepared for review by the regional offices. The eggs shall be distributed in accordance with the priority established in RCW 77.95.210 if they are available. A request for viable eggs may only be denied if the eggs would not be useful for propagation or salmon recovery purposes, as determined under RCW 77.95.210;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exempt volunteer groups from payment of fees to the department for activities related to the project;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Publicize the cooperative program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not substitute a new cooperative project for any part of the department's program unless mutually agreeable to the department and volunteer group;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not approve agreements that are incompatible with legally existing land, water, or property rights.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may, when requested, provide to volunteer groups its available professional expertise and assist the volunteer group to evaluate its project. The department must conduct annual workshops in each administrative region of the department that has fish stocks listed as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 1531 et seq., in order to assist volunteer groups with egg rearing, share information on successful salmon recovery projects accomplished by volunteers within the state, and provide basic training on monitoring efforts that can be accomplished by volunteers in order to help determine if their efforts are successful.</p>

<p>The commission shall establish by rule:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The procedure for entering a cooperative agreement and the application forms for a permit to release fish or wildlife required by *RCW 77.12.457. The procedure shall indicate the information required from the volunteer group as well as the process of review by the department. The process of review shall include the means to coordinate with other agencies and Indian tribes when appropriate and to coordinate the review of any necessary hydraulic permit approval applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The procedure for providing within forty-five days of receipt of a proposal a written response to the volunteer group indicating the date by which an acceptance or rejection of the proposal can be expected, the reason why the date was selected, and a written summary of the process of review. The response should also include any suggested modifications to the proposal which would increase its likelihood of approval and the date by which such modified proposal could be expected to be accepted. If the proposal is rejected, the department must provide in writing the reasons for rejection. The volunteer group may request the director or the director's designee to review information provided in the response.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The priority of the uses to which eggs, seed, juveniles, or brood stock are put. Use by cooperative projects shall be second in priority only to the needs of programs of the department or of other public agencies within the territorial boundaries of the state. Sales of eggs, seed, juveniles, or brood stock have a lower priority than use for cooperative projects. The rules must identify and implement appropriate protocols for brood stock handling, including the outplanting of adult fish, spawning, incubation, rearing, and release and establish a prioritized schedule for implementation of chapter 337, Laws of 2001, and shall include directives for allowing more hatchery salmon to spawn naturally in areas where progeny of hatchery fish have spawned, including the outplanting of adult fish, in order to increase the number of viable salmon eggs and restore healthy numbers of fish within the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The procedure for the director to notify a volunteer group that the agreement for the project is being revoked for cause and the procedure for revocation. Revocation shall be documented in writing to the volunteer group. Cause for revocation may include: (a) The unavailability of adequate biological or financial resources; (b) the development of unacceptable biological or resource management conflicts; or (c) a violation of agreement provisions. Notice of cause to revoke for a violation of agreement provisions may specify a reasonable period of time within which the volunteer group must comply with any violated provisions of the agreement.</p>

<li>
<p>An appropriate method of distributing among volunteer groups fish, bird, or animal food or other supplies available for the program.</p>
