<p>There is hereby created and established a state commission to be known and designated as the Washington utilities and transportation commission, and in this chapter referred to as the commission.</p>
<p>The commission shall be composed of three members appointed by the governor, with the consent of the senate. Not more than two members of said commission shall belong to the same political party.</p>
<p>Each commissioner shall be appointed and hold office for the term of six years. The governor shall designate one of the commissioners to be chair of the commission during the term of the governor.</p>
<p>Each commissioner shall receive a salary as may be fixed by the governor in accordance with the provisions of RCW 43.03.040.</p>
<p>Any member of the commission may be removed for inefficiency, malfeasance or misfeasance in office, upon specific written charges filed by the governor, who shall transmit such written charges to the member accused and to the chief justice of the supreme court. The chief justice shall thereupon designate a special tribunal composed of three judges of the superior court to hear and adjudicate the charges. Such tribunal shall fix the time, place and procedure for the hearing, and the hearing shall be public. The decision of such tribunal shall be final and not subject to review.</p>
<p>If the tribunal specified herein finds the charges of the governor to be true, the governor shall have the right to immediately remove the commissioner from office, to declare the position of the commissioner vacant, and appoint another commissioner to the position in accordance with the provisions of the law.</p>
<p>Any vacancy arising in the office of commissioner shall be filled by appointment by the governor, and, except for persons appointed as pro tempore commissioners, an appointee selected to fill a vacancy shall hold office for the balance of the full term for which his or her predecessor on the commission was appointed.</p>
<p>If a vacancy occurs while the senate is not in session, the governor shall make a temporary appointment until the next meeting of the senate, when he or she shall present to the senate his or her nomination or nominations for the office to be filled.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Administrative law judges may not enter final orders, except that the commission may designate persons by rule to preside and enter final orders in emergency adjudications under RCW 34.05.479. Initial orders of administrative law judges shall become final on the day following expiration of the time established by the commission for filing a petition for administrative review, unless, within that time, a party petitions for administrative review or the commission notifies parties that it will review the initial order on its own motion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the administrative law judge does not enter an initial order as provided in subsection (2) of this section, then a majority of the members of the commission who are to enter the final order must hear or review substantially all of the record submitted by any party.</p>
